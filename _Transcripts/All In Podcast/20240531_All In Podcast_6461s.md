# Trump verdict, COVID Cover-up, Crypto Corner, Salesforce drops 20%, AI correction?
**All In Podcast:** [May 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw)
*  All right, everybody. As you know, there was a big verdict that came out today in the Trump trial [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=0.0s)]
*  in New York City. However, it came right after we were taping. So enjoy this episode. And then at [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=7.2s)]
*  the end, we'll go around the horn and get quick reaction from each of the besties on what they [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=12.32s)]
*  think of the Trump guilty verdict in the New York hush money trial. And a little update on the market [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=17.44s)]
*  close and tech stocks tanking and after our trading stick with us, man, what a week I had. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=24.48s)]
*  Oh, you have an intro. I smell an intro. Tell us what kind of weekend you had. What kind of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=31.84s)]
*  week have you credit? You know, I got to, you know, I've always been a fan of Howard Stern [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=37.6s)]
*  and his agent, Don Buckwell called me. He saw the show last week. This is all true. And they said [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  they want to start a production company. So I started a production company and I've already [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=49.6s)]
*  got my first show. I've signed my first show, the pilot. What is the show? Well, here it is. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=53.2s)]
*  Let me show you. Thanks for asking. What you are witnessing is real. The besties are not actors. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=57.68000000000001s)]
*  The cases are real. Both parties have agreed to settle their disputes here in our forum, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  Jay Cowell production, the Rain Man's Court. Yeah, it's the law fair on today's show. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=75.28s)]
*  Shamar guilty of first degree unbuttoning. Friedberg accused of plastic perjury. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=82.64s)]
*  Jason appealing his grifting conviction. Throwing the book at Thelonious Fauci. Welcome to the stand, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  Judge David Sacks. Hot water burn baby. Nice. That's really good. It's a first show from [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=97.68s)]
*  Jake judge, then what does that make you? Are you like the bailiff? Like, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=102.4s)]
*  like the host? Yeah. He's the guy who does American Idol. Right? Right. Seacrest. I'm [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=106.72s)]
*  like going to be the new Ryan Seacrest. That's what they envisioned for me. And that's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=113.36000000000001s)]
*  my first spin on. So here we go. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=117.12s)]
*  There's a lot of news. My inbox is blowing up. I went over to threads to see what was going on [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=133.04s)]
*  over there. And I got absolutely savage. Threads is like all the hall monitors lacked one school. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=140.72s)]
*  Like if they took the four hall monitors from every school in the country and you put them all in one [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=146.24s)]
*  place, that's threads. Threads is like Zuckerberg's Twitter revenge killer that he created, but all the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=150.32s)]
*  journalists and woke folks went there. And then all the conspiracy theories took over X and Twitter [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=159.52s)]
*  and like freedom of speech in one place. And then the hall monitors and the other, but my Lord, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=164.56s)]
*  the inbound I'm getting Sacks on apparently you're having a party this Thursday and a couple of people [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  are coming a soiree. It's my birthday party. Oh, yeah. Okay. So there's a little soiree happening. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  Sacks enlighten the audience. What are you up to? We're hosting an event for president Trump. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=182.08s)]
*  I'm sorry. What did you say? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=189.52s)]
*  Yeah, we're hosting an event for the once and future president 45 and 45 is soon to be 47. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  Who's we? As I saw from your own polling data that you tweeted this morning, Jason. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=204.96s)]
*  God, it's so dark. It's so dark. I mean, the betting markets are just, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=208.72s)]
*  basically they seem to have already made their decision. The betting markets, right? And the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=214.08s)]
*  betting markets, they're not always right, but they were wrong actually about Hillary and Trump. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  So who knows? And polling historically has underestimated Trump's support because people [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=222.16s)]
*  have been reluctant to say they're supporting him for some reason. So yeah, things are looking [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=228.16000000000003s)]
*  very positive for Trump right now. But in any event, we're hosting a fundraiser for him. And [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=233.36s)]
*  he said that he wants to come on the all in pod at some point. So we just need to schedule that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=240.72s)]
*  And by the way, we did this for, let's not forget, we did this for our FK [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  Jr. He appeared on the pod. We did a fundraiser for him. We did it for fake Ramaswamy came on [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=249.2s)]
*  the pod. We did a fundraiser for him. We did it for Dean Phillips. Yeah, that's right. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=254.64s)]
*  And Chris Christie came on, although I don't think we technically did a fundraiser, but we would have. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=260.8s)]
*  And we've asked President Biden and we have not heard back. And when we say we, sorry, let me just [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=266.0s)]
*  parse that out. So first of all, who's we and Chamath, would you host a fundraiser for Biden [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=271.92s)]
*  as well as Trump? Absolutely. Look, here's the thing. I am an apolitical person who has to make [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=275.92s)]
*  a difficult decision every four years. And I think most of us are like that. I don't think it's so [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=281.92s)]
*  easy to wake up in the morning and say, Oh, I'm clearly a Republican or I'm clearly a Democrat. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=286.72s)]
*  There's parts of both sides that appeal to me. And so you have to make these reasoned decisions. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=291.76s)]
*  And then that gets even more complicated. Right. So the most important thing for me is [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=297.68s)]
*  get as many people on in a position to tell their version of the truth so that you can see an [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=302.64s)]
*  unfiltered version of that truth and decide for yourself. So I was really blown away when [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=309.6s)]
*  I heard Dean Phillips and Bobby. And I thought there's parts of both of those platforms that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=316.4s)]
*  I agree with. There's parts that I disagree. And the same thing happened when I sat down with Vivek. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=321.52s)]
*  I thought that I wouldn't agree with much. I ended up agreeing with a lot. There's a lot of stuff [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=325.6s)]
*  that Trump in hindsight, again, as I've said before, that he did, which was really helpful [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=329.92s)]
*  to America. And one big thing which had he done, frankly, sets up our children, which is these [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=334.72s)]
*  hundred year bonds and defraying the cost of all of this indebtedness far out into the future. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  So there's many things. And I think there's things that Biden has done that I think will look back [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  and say those were good things that he did. And then there are things in the future, or today, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=351.04s)]
*  that I think that we could disagree with as well. So the point is, I would like this place [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=354.88s)]
*  to be a place where impartiality rules, where we can be on all sides of an issue and just decide [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=361.68s)]
*  what makes the most sense after looking at the facts. And I would like, four years from now, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  every major political candidate for president to look at All In as the first place. And I think [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=372.96s)]
*  if we can earn that trust and have the integrity to allow all sides to tell a fair story, that is [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=378.96s)]
*  going to be a really powerful thing and an artifact to leave behind for people. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=384.48s)]
*  Aaron Powell Well, in fact, RFK believes that we shot him out of a cannon, is I think what he said, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=388.32s)]
*  or something, and that we got the sort of canonsy going. Vivek, I think, also kind of debuted here [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=393.20000000000005s)]
*  in a major way. To be clear, All In isn't hosting the fundraiser sacks. You and Chamath are. I'm not [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=398.8s)]
*  donating. I'm not going. Freebird, you're not donating. I don't know if you're going or not. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=404.64000000000004s)]
*  I think you told me you're not going. You're not donating or going. Got it. Okay. He waved his hand. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=409.20000000000005s)]
*  And so I don't know. Look, don't need to blow up a candidate as an individual choice that each [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=414.64000000000004s)]
*  person's got to decide if they want to do it. Right. As Americans, we can do that. Yeah. If [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=419.20000000000005s)]
*  you're willing to open your pocketbook, which I know Jason's on something that you're inclined [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=424.08000000000004s)]
*  to do very often. I mean, I don't, I'm not big into politics and the idea of giving money to politicians [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  to me, not my thing. You know, I have, I'd rather invest in the next startup, to be totally honest. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=433.44s)]
*  If I'm going to put 50k towards something or God forbid, 250k for me, I'll put that in a startup. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=437.76s)]
*  That's what I like to do. But you know, everybody's different. And, you know, for the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=442.56s)]
*  people who are asking me to not be friends with Sachs anymore, I'm going to be friends with Sachs [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=446.48s)]
*  forever. We love each other besties and he can have a different opinion than me. I I'm getting [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=450.64s)]
*  a totally absolutely crucified that I'm supporting Trump and how could I be friends with Sachs? Go [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=456.08s)]
*  f**k yourself. Sachs is my friend. We can have a difference of opinion on some topics. Good for you, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=461.36s)]
*  Jason. That is the good thing. Learn something. Sorry. Good for you. Sorry. I'll just say, I've [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=465.92s)]
*  heard the same thing and I told friends and others that have reached out. Why are you [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=470.48s)]
*  associating yourself with people that are doing a fundraiser for Trump? And I said exactly because [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=475.76s)]
*  I think it's really important that people can have different political interests, different points [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=481.36s)]
*  of view, different beliefs and still be friends and still have a conversation. If we can model [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=487.20000000000005s)]
*  that in any way, I think it moves the needle because this whole thing where you only speak with, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=492.24s)]
*  only hang out with, only talk to, only have dinner with people that you agree with, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=497.52s)]
*  I think is exactly what got us in the mess that we're in today. People need to have a broader [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=501.28s)]
*  perspective. So well said. And I'll support you guys with whatever in terms of like being your [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=505.2s)]
*  friends. I'm not going to ever judge you guys in terms of what you believe in or choose to do. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=511.68s)]
*  We've said this before, but you know, in the end, what do you have? You have your family, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=515.84s)]
*  you have your children, you have your friends, and hopefully you have work that gives you some [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=520.8s)]
*  purpose. And in all of that, if there are random people that are judging you for one thing, they'll [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=524.88s)]
*  eventually judge you for another thing. And that is not a path to any sort of contentment. I've [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=529.84s)]
*  donated to Bobby Kennedy, I've donated to the Democrats massively, and I'll donate to Donald [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=534.8s)]
*  Trump. And if there's an opportunity to talk to President Biden and really understand where he's [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=540.56s)]
*  at, I donate to him as well. And so the point is that I would like to be an organizing principle. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=547.28s)]
*  And I would like to replace today the places that I don't trust to organize and give unfiltered [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=555.28s)]
*  access to knowledge. And those things are the mainstream media. And so I'm willing to put my [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=562.56s)]
*  resources behind being that organizing principle. And I think having a broad cross-section of friends [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=566.8s)]
*  who have different political beliefs is actually a useful thing for a lot of these candidates. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=572.08s)]
*  Because as it turns out, most people are sort of in the middle. And most people in any given election [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=576.96s)]
*  can be persuaded one way or the other. So the most important thing that we can do is get all of them, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=583.2s)]
*  give all of them an opportunity to really tell an unfiltered version of their truth, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=588.8000000000001s)]
*  and then let the chips fall where they may. That is the right thing to do for America. That's what [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=593.9200000000001s)]
*  democracy needs. So this kind of like cajoling and bullying in either side, I find really distasteful, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=597.9200000000001s)]
*  and I find very immature. Yeah, it's not gonna work. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=604.88s)]
*  What's amazing is, I mean, I really haven't gotten any blowback. You know, there's a question about [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=607.9200000000001s)]
*  people ask me, have you gotten blowback from this thing? And no, not really. I mean, other than the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=613.2s)]
*  reporter knocking on my door and that kind of stuff. But people really... Same. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=617.6s)]
*  It hasn't really created a blowback. And I think you guys are getting more blowback. And that's an [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=622.48s)]
*  indication of sort of the cowardly response to it, which is, you know, it's like a cancellation tactic. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=626.5600000000001s)]
*  We're gonna try and like go behind your back and ostracize you instead of even telling you to your [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=633.36s)]
*  face what you think. And I think the reason why they're doing that is because quite frankly, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=638.4s)]
*  there's a lot of preference falsification going on in Silicon Valley. I know there's a lot of people [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=643.1999999999999s)]
*  in Silicon Valley who... Well, we know because we know who's coming. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=648.24s)]
*  Yeah, you have the list of people who don't. I mean, look, nobody is excited about Biden. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=653.36s)]
*  Okay? Nobody's excited about Biden right now. So the only question is, do they hold their nose [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=657.52s)]
*  and vote for him, or do they vote for Trump, or do they vote for Bobby Kennedy? But there's a lot [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=662.48s)]
*  of people who I do think support Trump. And look, we've A-B tested this, right? It'd be different [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=667.52s)]
*  if we didn't have four years of Biden and four years of Trump. There's a lot of people who can [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=673.28s)]
*  look back and say that the A-B test we ran indicates Trump. So I know there's gonna be a lot of people [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=676.8s)]
*  who support Trump, but they don't wanna admit it. And I think that this event is gonna break the ice [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=683.36s)]
*  on that. And maybe it'll create a preference cascade where all of a sudden it becomes acceptable [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=688.8s)]
*  to acknowledge the truth, which is a lot of people support Trump. And it's not just this. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=693.84s)]
*  It's also Steve Schwartzman came out. I think Bill Ackman's on the edge of coming out for Trump. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=699.0400000000001s)]
*  So there's a lot of people who are now flipping, and I think it could really start to cascade [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=704.4000000000001s)]
*  on itself. I think the thing that hasn't happened yet is we haven't actually now started to talk [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=710.1600000000001s)]
*  about the contours of a handful of policy things where there is some deep diversion now, where [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=715.2s)]
*  these candidates are diverging from each other. And I think that that's going to be really [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=722.64s)]
*  interesting to see how much people value that differentiation. I'll give you an example, which [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=726.72s)]
*  is President Trump in the last few weeks has become incredibly pro-crypto. Now, the contours [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=732.72s)]
*  of that, I think we need to define, right? But the question is, is a pro-crypto environment, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=740.16s)]
*  especially in a world where we think that there's just going to be continued dollar debasement, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=745.68s)]
*  an important issue, an unimportant issue, or a thing that is a small issue today, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=750.4799999999999s)]
*  but that will be critical for us in 20 and 30 years to get right? That's an example. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=757.04s)]
*  And there's a handful of these other things that I think that now we have a chance to really double [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=762.16s)]
*  click on, where there really is some differentiation amongst the three presidential candidates. And I [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=766.0s)]
*  think that's healthy as well. And so it's important, again, get their specific thoughts on the record [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=771.12s)]
*  so that we can really figure this out. And I think that over these next few months, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=776.9599999999999s)]
*  I think it's going to be important to do that. So I hope President Biden also comes on the [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=782.3199999999999s)]
*  pod, quite honestly, and allows us to ask him the hard questions. And I hope Bobby comes back on, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=786.0s)]
*  actually, and I think Bobby will, if we ask him, just to tighten up where he's at now, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=793.04s)]
*  a few months before. Yeah, there's definitely a lot of great follow-up questions. I would love [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=797.92s)]
*  to interview Trump. I'll ask him hard questions. I'll respect him as President in 45 and as a [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=800.96s)]
*  candidate. So for people who are like, you have Trump's arrangement syndrome, that's just a [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=805.28s)]
*  childish thing to say. I disagree with his policies. I'll ask him questions. Hey, why don't [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=810.8s)]
*  you support EVs? That's a valid question to ask him. Why is he anti-EV? He said all these crazy [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=814.56s)]
*  things about EVs, and then apparently he's courting you on privately. I don't know if that's true or [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=819.8399999999999s)]
*  not. But there's hard questions, and I'm sure he'll answer them. And he's more than capable of [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=823.68s)]
*  doing it. I'm excited. I'm really excited for President Trump to come on the podcast. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=829.1999999999999s)]
*  I'd love to have him on. And for me, I'll be totally honest. I think the Democrats have to [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=833.12s)]
*  wake up for a second and just take the temperature of the room, read the room, Democrats. You have [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=836.9599999999999s)]
*  put up a candidate that nobody wants. His policies on the border and some other issues are not [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=842.9599999999999s)]
*  in sync with the majority of the country. At some point, the Democrats just have to [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=849.28s)]
*  take a deep look in the mirror. James Carvel is doing it. A bunch of them are doing it and say, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=852.9599999999999s)]
*  we feel that a bad candidate who's too old and people don't believe will stand up to scrutiny [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=856.56s)]
*  of like, say, being on the all in pot for two hours or in the debates or with a hostile interview [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=862.48s)]
*  or any of those possibilities. And so I think if that's the case, we really need to have the [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=867.76s)]
*  Democrats think deeply about maybe fielding a different candidate. And I believe that's [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=873.76s)]
*  what's going to happen in the next 30 to 60 days. So I'm predicting- [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=878.5600000000001s)]
*  Do you think there's going to be a switcheroo? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=881.36s)]
*  100%. I mean, if you just look at the polls, it's 100% there'll be a switcheroo. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=883.44s)]
*  Who's the switcheroo? I have no idea. It could be Gavin. It could be anybody. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=888.5600000000001s)]
*  Anything's possible. I think Trump's going to demolish him in the debate. I think he'll [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=891.76s)]
*  sink to 30% in the polls. And then the Republicans are going to find out, I'm sorry, the Democrats [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=895.92s)]
*  will find a way to give him a graceful out and then they'll field somebody else. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=901.4399999999999s)]
*  When's the first debate? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=904.72s)]
*  June 17th. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=906.48s)]
*  Can I respond to that? I saw your tweet basically saying something very similar, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=907.2s)]
*  that Democrats need to wake up and, you know, recognize the situation they're in. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=911.04s)]
*  I think this is a case of once you've made your bed, you have to sleep in it. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=915.92s)]
*  Look, the Democrats have set the table pursuing certain policies for the last three and a half [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=920.64s)]
*  years. We've had an open border. We had so much spending that it fed into this inflation, which [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=926.64s)]
*  jacked up interest rates. We had Ukraine become the central obsession and focus of our politics, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=932.4s)]
*  which blew up in Biden's face with the whole summer counteroffensive. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=939.12s)]
*  I mean, I could go on. You have the hostility to crypto, which they're now trying to desperately [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=943.68s)]
*  backpedal on, but you had three years of Elizabeth Warren and Gensler basically making crypto the [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=948.0s)]
*  enemy. And now all of a sudden we're at first and go at that like 10 yard line and you're all of a [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=953.28s)]
*  sudden saying, well, just read the room and make all these changes. You can't, you know, I don't [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=957.76s)]
*  think people are going to be fooled by that. We've A-B tested this thing. We've had three and a half [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=962.88s)]
*  years of Biden, four years of Trump. Who do you like better? And we're what, how many months are [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=967.76s)]
*  we from pulling the lever? Five months? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=973.76s)]
*  Never too late. I'm telling them to do it. Don't take Sachs's advice. He is a hardcore [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=976.8s)]
*  person who wants to win desperately. Take J. Kyle's advice. Field another candidate. The worst thing [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=981.5999999999999s)]
*  the Republicans could ever deal with is a great candidate who can speak and who's nimble on their [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=986.9599999999999s)]
*  feet because I think people are looking for a choice that's not these two individuals. I'm not [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=992.4799999999999s)]
*  going to say I'm anti-Trump. I'm not going to say I'm anti-Biden. Why don't you support Bobby Kennedy then? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=996.88s)]
*  I don't think he's going to have the platform behind him to get enough votes. I think the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1001.12s)]
*  Democrats need to immediately this month in June do the switcheroo. And if they do, I think they [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1005.2s)]
*  went in the lens. They had their chance. They had their chance. They could have gone for Bobby. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1011.0400000000001s)]
*  They can change anytime. They drove Bobby out of the party. That's not their only chance. He didn't start as [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1014.72s)]
*  an independent. He started as a Democrat. I know by his last name, it's a Democrat. A [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1019.6800000000001s)]
*  Kennedy Democrat. Kind of in the name. You had Dean Phillips. Dean Phillips took the chance. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1022.88s)]
*  And of course he was pushed out. Not of the party, but basically ostracized. They had their chance. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1027.3600000000001s)]
*  I think if I want to be a strategist, this is just a conspiracy theory. I don't want to go to [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1033.1200000000001s)]
*  Chinfoil Hat Corner. I think the Democrats, as cynical as it sounds, were waiting to see what [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1037.76s)]
*  happens with this Trump trials conviction, what you call lawfare, what other people call fair use of [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1042.16s)]
*  the law. And then they are going to see how he does in the debates. That's why they moved the debate [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1047.2800000000002s)]
*  up in June. And I think they know to pull the plug on this if it gets too far gone. And they have the [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1052.24s)]
*  ability to do that because all he's got to say is, you know what? I'm feeling old and I want us to [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1058.16s)]
*  win and I'm going to slot somebody else in. But listen, let's go get to this. Yeah. Translate [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1064.0800000000002s)]
*  what you just said, which is the Democrats hope to put Trump in jail using lawfare. And when that [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1069.2s)]
*  fails, they realize that they're going to lose the election to him and they've got a big problem. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1073.8400000000001s)]
*  So they're going to try some desperate strategy to find a new candidate, but it's way too late [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1077.6000000000001s)]
*  for that. I think precisely. Thank you for repeating back to me. And I think the only [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1080.96s)]
*  disagreement we might have there is I would agree like there's lawfare in two of the cases. And I [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1087.44s)]
*  think two of the cases I think are, are, should be pursued, but you know, we can intelligent people, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1091.68s)]
*  as we said at the start of this can agree to disagree about it. And I think you should all [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1097.1200000000001s)]
*  take, if you're a listener to this podcast, you're smart. If you're here, you're smart. You're not [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1101.04s)]
*  listening to two hour podcasts with us going this deep on issues. If you're not a brilliant, smart [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1105.28s)]
*  and attractive individual. So let's get to the docket. Yes, that's right. Just say he heard [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1110.96s)]
*  brilliant and attractive and here. All right. Listen, I, I hate to go into another controversial [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1117.2s)]
*  topic, but the four of us were all on fire about this. Apparently the COVID-19 investigation is [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1124.96s)]
*  leaning towards a massive coverup. There's a subcommittee going on right now. The world's [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1132.32s)]
*  not paying attention to this, but I think some savvy people are, especially over on X is a lot [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1137.8400000000001s)]
*  of great journalists who are doing incredible investigative work. Let me just catch everybody [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1142.8s)]
*  up in the audience real quick here and get the besties involved over the past year and a half, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1147.6s)]
*  how subcommittee has been focused on the origins of COVID-19 and they've been investigating the [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1151.2s)]
*  NIH's ties with gain of function research in Wuhan. The subcommittee was painted early on. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1156.8799999999999s)]
*  It's like, this is angry Republicans. This is about mask mandates. It was like highly politicized, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1162.6399999999999s)]
*  but it's actually turned out to be very effective bipartisan investigation. We'll get on, we'll get [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1166.88s)]
*  in on that in a minute, but so far most of the investigation is focused on nailing down this [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1172.96s)]
*  timeline of communication between NIH officials and an organization called eco health Alliance. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1178.16s)]
*  This is a nonprofit that's focused on infectious disease research. Now these committee videos are [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1184.16s)]
*  online. We'll pay you play on in a moment, but through funding in the NIH, the eco health [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1190.3200000000002s)]
*  organization was awarded research grants to various labs. This included the Wuhan Institute [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1195.52s)]
*  of virology, the infamous one. Eco health violated terms of its grants by failing to report [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1200.72s)]
*  that gain of function experiments were being conducted in Wuhan. Eco health was supposed [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1207.28s)]
*  to report any experiment that exhibited characteristics leading it to being 10 times [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1212.0800000000002s)]
*  more infectious. But when that happened, it failed to disclose this research to the NIH. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1216.0s)]
*  And on May 17th, a deputy director of the NIH acknowledged that the agency funded gain of [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1220.24s)]
*  function research in Wuhan via eco health. This is the key because Fauci initially denied this [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1226.0s)]
*  during his 2021 Senate hearing. Fauci said, quote, I totally resent the lie. You are now [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1232.48s)]
*  propagating in response to questions from Rand Paul about the lab league theory. So Fauci either [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1238.24s)]
*  didn't know, or he lied under oath. Let me pause there for a second. There's a lot more to the [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1243.1200000000001s)]
*  story, but when you hear this sort of set up, Breedberg, our Sultan of science in this initial [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1247.36s)]
*  setup, what rings concerning to you, true to you, and then we'll go on and we play some clips of [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1254.3999999999999s)]
*  this testimony, which is pretty wild. I don't think that pre the emergence of the pandemic, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1259.36s)]
*  that there was nefarious motives. In other words, their funding of this was not done to create a [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1266.4799999999998s)]
*  pandemic. It might've been a mistake in hindsight, but yeah, for many years, particularly following [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1273.2s)]
*  the original SARS pandemic, there was a lot of conversations around how do we get in front of [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1278.72s)]
*  the next pandemic? How do we figure out what's coming and how do we prepare for it? And there [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1284.0s)]
*  was a lot of research that was launched to try and resolve that key question. This is like the [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1289.04s)]
*  movie 12 monkeys. You guys ever see that movie? It's like, does the effort to try and stop the [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1296.48s)]
*  problem cause the problem? I think that for my point of view, there's a very high probability that [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1304.72s)]
*  there was some leak that meant that the work that was going on to try and get in front of the next [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1309.1200000000001s)]
*  pandemic and understand what we could do to prepare ourselves and what vaccines can be developed and [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1316.24s)]
*  so on actually led to the pandemic. So then when that happens, how do you respond when you're [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1320.08s)]
*  sitting in that seat? That's the key question that I think this committee is uncovering. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1324.48s)]
*  Do you think there was a cover-up free break? What is your intuition on that? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1329.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think that these guys definitely didn't want, I think what they were trying to do was [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1332.08s)]
*  prevent that from being the focal point and protect their own asses at the same time. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1336.56s)]
*  Do you think they should go to jail? I don't know the extent of it yet. It'd be good to get more [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1340.48s)]
*  information from this whole thing. Yeah, so let me cue up those next details. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1345.04s)]
*  I will say this guy that gave testimony last week where he was like deliberately changing the names [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1347.76s)]
*  of people in the email, Anderson, and he put the dollar sign so that you couldn't find that email [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1352.08s)]
*  when you did a FOIA search. He knew what he was doing. I don't understand how you could say this [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1356.8s)]
*  wasn't nefarious. This whole thing was nefarious from top to bottom. Well, yeah, let me cue this [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1362.8799999999999s)]
*  up here, Saxon, and then get your- Why are you exonerating it? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1367.76s)]
*  Hold on. Let me cue it up. All right. So we started to see some consequences and accountability. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1370.08s)]
*  Last week, the US Department of Health cut all funding to EcoHealth in response to the committee's [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1374.56s)]
*  investigation. They disbarred its president, Peter Daszak. Daszak, yeah. Daszak. And so we [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1379.12s)]
*  don't have direct evidence to be clear that the pandemic was the result of a lab leak. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1385.76s)]
*  And just even saying the lab leak, we would have gotten this- [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1390.8799999999999s)]
*  The Fearing Cleavage site makes it clear that this was a lab leak. That's not a naturally occurring [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1395.36s)]
*  virus. The Fearing Cleavage sites were engineered. Let's go to that in just one second. And [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1401.9199999999998s)]
*  thankfully, this isn't going to get our YouTube channel shut down because we have freedom of [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1407.68s)]
*  speech back a little bit. But this is where it gets really interesting. Emails were written [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1411.92s)]
*  as EcoHealth with a tilde. That's that little squiggly line instead of an O. And they would [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1419.2s)]
*  spell Anderson with a dollar sign in the E. Christian Anderson, in this example, is a [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1425.52s)]
*  biologist who was reportedly awarded nine million in grants from the NIH two months [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1431.3600000000001s)]
*  after publishing a paper claiming COVID did not come from a lab. And so let's get to some of these [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1435.04s)]
*  clips. Here's a clip of Fauci's former top advisor, David Moran's, getting grilled in the hearing. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1440.8s)]
*  And I'll play two clips and then I'll give it to you. On October 25th, 2021, another scientist [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1447.6s)]
*  wrote, quote, David is concerned about the privacy of text and other messages from his cell phone to [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1452.32s)]
*  you and me because he has been using a government phone. This came from Tony, end quote. Sir, did [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1457.92s)]
*  you ever have any conversations with Dr. Fauci regarding using personal phone or email to [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1462.96s)]
*  communicate with Dr. Dasik? I don't remember it. It's possible. You know, I probably wouldn't have [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1468.72s)]
*  remembered it and I don't remember it. On January 18th, you testified that you did not have any [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1474.08s)]
*  conversations with Dr. Fauci regarding EcoHealth. On October 25th, 2021, you wrote, quote, Peter, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1479.52s)]
*  from Tony's numerous recent comments to me, they're trying to protect you, end quote. You meaning [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1487.44s)]
*  EcoHealth and Dr. Dasik. Dr. Moran's, did you ever have any conversations with Dr. Fauci [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1495.04s)]
*  regarding EcoHealth? Well, the ones you just mentioned, I don't have any recollection of that. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1500.8799999999999s)]
*  No recollection. No recollection. No. All right. So we're on the no recollection train. And then [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1505.44s)]
*  I'll give this final clip here. This is unbelievable, Saks. Apparently there's a [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1510.96s)]
*  FOIA lady, Freedom of Information Act lady, working at NIH to train and help and mentor people on how [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1516.08s)]
*  to avoid having their communications. These are people who work for us. And she's the FOIA lady [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1524.4s)]
*  at NIH. Play the clip, Nick. And as you've said, you previously testified that you did not delete [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1533.1200000000001s)]
*  any federal records. But on February 24th, 2021, you wrote, quote, I learned from our FOIA lady here [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1539.36s)]
*  how to make emails disappear after I'm FOIA'd, but before the search starts. So I think we are [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1545.04s)]
*  all safe. Plus I deleted most of those earlier emails after sending them to Gmail, end quote. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1550.32s)]
*  And the next day on February 25th, 2021, you wrote, quote, but I learned the tricks last year from an [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1555.84s)]
*  old friend, Marge Moore, who heads our FOIA office and also hates FOIAs, end quote. Yes or no? Is [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1561.04s)]
*  Marge Moore the FOIA lady you were referring to? She was at the time. I believe she's retired since [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1568.48s)]
*  then. Did the NIH FOIA office instruct you on how to delete emails or avoid FOIA? No. All right, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1574.4s)]
*  Saks. There's your red meat, smoking guns everywhere. What do you think? Please give me a couple of [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1581.04s)]
*  minutes to kind of lay out what happened here. Okay. So Fauci knew very early, as early as February [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1585.2s)]
*  1st of 2020, that COVID came from a lab leak. The scientists said so all they had to do was look [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1594.08s)]
*  in our microscope and see the furan cleavage site, which is not naturally occurring. It's something [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1599.04s)]
*  that was added, basically bioengineered to the virus in order to make it more transmissible [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1604.3999999999999s)]
*  in humans. So they knew right away that this somehow came from a lab leak. And Fauci and Collins [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1610.48s)]
*  said in emails that they were going to begin a brutal takedown in order to conceal this fundamental [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1618.72s)]
*  truth of the lab leak from the public. Now, why would Fauci need to conceal this? Because he had [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1624.4s)]
*  funded gain-of-function research programs via Peter Daszczak and the EcoHealth Alliance to conduct, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1629.2s)]
*  again, gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1636.72s)]
*  Moreover, Fauci was personally responsible for reversing an Obama-era decision to prohibit [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1640.72s)]
*  gain-of-function research because it was so risky. Fauci wrote op-eds justifying gain-of-function [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1647.2s)]
*  research. He wrote a paper in 2012, which was actually quite candid about the risk of gain-of-function. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1653.92s)]
*  He describes the kind of lab leak that could occur in the type of virus that could escape from a lab [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1659.76s)]
*  because of gain-of-function. But then he says that it's a risk worth taking. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1667.6000000000001s)]
*  So this is somebody who funded the Wuhan lab. He funded gain-of-function research. He was [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1671.52s)]
*  personally responsible for lifting the ban on gain-of-function research. He had a lot of reasons [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1676.64s)]
*  to want to hide the fact that COVID was engineered in a lab and was lab leak. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1682.0800000000002s)]
*  And so we know that even before this conspiracy to basically defraud the FOIA request, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1688.0800000000002s)]
*  that Fauci had done things like organize that letter to the Lancet, which smeared and demonized [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1694.48s)]
*  scientists who were trying to tell the truth, saying that the so-called zoological theory was [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1700.3200000000002s)]
*  nonsense, this had to be from a lab. He was doing things like this. And now we have this added piece, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1705.28s)]
*  which is this longtime colleague of Fauci and Collins at NIH, Dr. David Morenz, developed a [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1711.12s)]
*  strategy for evading FOIA requests that would expose the truth. He did this by deleting [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1717.84s)]
*  government emails, which is a crime, by using private email to conduct government business, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1722.3999999999999s)]
*  which is also a crime, and then strategically misspelling names and titles to frustrate the [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1726.48s)]
*  FOIA searches. And then the craziest part is that Morenz foolishly detailed his schemes in emails [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1731.2s)]
*  that Fauci would have seen, that Fauci was on the distribution list stuff. So he has no [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1739.2s)]
*  plausible deniability. It's literally like they're like, here's how we can avoid getting caught [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1743.28s)]
*  in an email. You have to see the FOIA piece within the overall picture here, which is [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1747.52s)]
*  Fauci from the get-go was lying about the origins of COVID in order to cover up his role [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1754.16s)]
*  in funding this type of research. And there was a comprehensive effort by people at NIH, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1763.92s)]
*  likely at Fauci's direction, to again, not just cover this up, but to smear [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1771.68s)]
*  scientists who were going to the truth. And this became the basis. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1777.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. People like Jay Bhattacharya, who then got banned on Twitter. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1781.8400000000001s)]
*  Got banned and banned on social media. By the way, who is a Stanford professor? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1784.96s)]
*  Yeah. Was banned for speaking up. Chamath, let's zoom out here and start thinking strategy [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1790.16s)]
*  and theories of what's going on here. I have my own, but I'm curious to hear you as far as [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1795.5200000000002s)]
*  as we go around the horn here. What's your take on this? I would like to make four points, I think, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1800.16s)]
*  that kind of summarize my view of this. I think what happened here needs a really clear accounting [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1804.8s)]
*  because the implications are far greater than I think people realize. And I think why maybe the [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1812.8799999999999s)]
*  four of us have always been tugging on this little thread is because each of us instinctively [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1818.3999999999999s)]
*  understood that. So the first is, if you just look at the macroeconomic consequences of what [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1824.0s)]
*  COVID did and our reaction, we broke the seal of having absolutely no accountability on massive [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1831.84s)]
*  spending. So there are subsidies, there are kickbacks, there are government programs that [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1838.9599999999998s)]
*  now number in the trillions of dollars a year, incremental to what we were going to spend if [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1844.56s)]
*  things were the status quo. And the problem is that, and Freeberg has talked about this really [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1850.48s)]
*  eloquently in the past, it's creating a massive debt issue that us and our children and our [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1855.36s)]
*  grandchildren will have to deal with. If we had responded to this pandemic differently, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1859.9199999999998s)]
*  those issues would not have occurred. If we had just kept the economy open because we understood [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1865.28s)]
*  what was going on, we would not have reacted the way that we did. And we would not have nearly as [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1870.9599999999998s)]
*  much debt as we had. And we would not have made it okay for politicians to spend trillions of dollars. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1876.6399999999999s)]
*  That is a direct consequence of our reaction to COVID, not COVID itself. The second is we caused [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1881.6799999999998s)]
*  billions of people all around the world to take immaturely tested drugs. They were called vaccines. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1889.12s)]
*  We found out that they were modestly effective at best. And then some of them were designed in some [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1896.56s)]
*  ways to manipulate our DNA. And we just don't know what the long term impacts will be. We see some [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1902.6399999999999s)]
*  small issues of myocarditis. We see other issues of all cause mortality. But the point is we just [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1908.0s)]
*  don't know. And that would not have happened had we not rushed to force people to stand in the line [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1914.64s)]
*  and get a jab in order to get back to their normal life. That was a direct consequence, not of COVID, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1920.96s)]
*  but of a reaction. The third is what we're realizing right now is that we had this [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1926.4s)]
*  power drunk apparatchik. And this is similar to the quote that Mike Pompeo made. When he took over [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1932.96s)]
*  the CIA, what he found, and he said this after when he left, was there were people on the top [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1941.04s)]
*  floor of the CIA building, the seventh floor of the Pentagon, that fundamentally believed that it [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1948.0s)]
*  wasn't the Democrats nor the Republicans that ran the country, but it was them. And I see a similar [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1954.24s)]
*  level of arrogance here, which is this belief that they know better. And so what they did was they [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1960.48s)]
*  committed the greatest sin, which is where the cover-up is way greater than the crime. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1967.2s)]
*  And they created a setup where all of these things were amplified by their prestige, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1973.04s)]
*  their perceived scientific knowledge. But what they were really doing was keeping critical [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1980.24s)]
*  information to themselves and then trying to cover it up, Jason. That is so unacceptable when you [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1985.04s)]
*  think of the broad consequences of what happened. And that's what needs to get documented. And I do [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1991.1200000000001s)]
*  think there needs to be some form of accountability for that. I think it's well said. And just [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=1996.0s)]
*  looking at it, I think we are now at the point of this conversation and investigation where we can [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2000.8s)]
*  say this is not a bipartisan, this is an issue. And everybody knew. We had these conversations on [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2006.32s)]
*  this very podcast. The public knew. Something didn't seem right about this. And if you just [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2011.84s)]
*  think about this from first principles of what occurred here, just what occurred here, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2015.92s)]
*  here. Treyberg, we funded gain of research to create these super viruses that what I think [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2020.88s)]
*  other people could just as equally call a bio weapon with the Chinese. Now we're supposed to be [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2029.7600000000002s)]
*  arch rivals here. We're like these competitors. And then when it came out and it leaked, and of [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2035.5200000000002s)]
*  course, I don't think it was released on purpose. When it came out, the people who work for us and [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2042.4s)]
*  we trust with our family safety, who funded this in order to save their own reputations [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2048.8s)]
*  to cover their asses, then lied about it. And then like as you said, Sachs, perfectly, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2055.6800000000003s)]
*  they went on the offensive. These people were not elected by anybody. These people work for us. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2061.28s)]
*  And they failed us. This is a crime against humanity of the greatest cause. People committed [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2068.96s)]
*  suicide. People died because they had depression. Our kids lost two years of school. This generation [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2075.68s)]
*  has lost their education. And now we have burdened them with billions, hundreds of billions of [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2083.2s)]
*  dollars in debt from this. This is a failure of leadership. It is a crime. And when people said [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2089.52s)]
*  prosecute Fauci, they were like, you're being hysterical. This is ridiculous. These people [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2099.68s)]
*  need to be prosecuted. If you hid this stuff from a FOIA request, you need to go to jail. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2104.08s)]
*  There needs to be accountability here. I think what they did to society, our children and the [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2110.88s)]
*  future. I am infuriated by this. Imagine what happened in the situation room or the equivalent [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2116.08s)]
*  wherever the president of the United States, all these world leaders were coalescing to try to make [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2121.04s)]
*  decisions in that period. They all looked at this quote unquote expert, they pointed at Fauci and [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2128.08s)]
*  said, lead us out. And so do we not think that at any point he was thinking, how do I do this in [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2133.44s)]
*  a way where I have no fingerprints? Clearly the answer is, in fact, he was leading from a position [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2139.52s)]
*  of how will I not have any fingerprints on this? And so did we get the best advice on the margin? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2144.2400000000002s)]
*  I think it's pretty fair to say we could not have gotten it because he was too conflicted. He was [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2151.36s)]
*  figuring out how to cover up what happened as opposed to just own it and then help the world [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2156.08s)]
*  get out of it. Yeah, I mean, talk about like incinerating your entire career and legacy, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2161.28s)]
*  but putting that aside, the morality of covering this up and you know, so then you have to think [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2166.5600000000004s)]
*  trauma. This is why I was like, what is the strategy? What goes through somebody's [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2172.48s)]
*  mind when they decide to do a cover up this level? Is it just fear of getting caught and their lives [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2177.1200000000003s)]
*  being in their mind ruined and they're going to do this incredible cover up? I actually think [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2182.4s)]
*  that they thought this would become a globally destabilizing moment between the United States [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2187.68s)]
*  and China, and that there could be revolutions. Now I know that this is now sounding really [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2193.2s)]
*  conspiracy theory. But if you're sitting there and you're like, what if the public finds out we [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2198.72s)]
*  created this, and their grandparents died from it, and their kids didn't go to school because [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2203.2s)]
*  of it, there'll be riots in the street. But if enough time passes, maybe there's not riots in [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2208.48s)]
*  the street. Well, you know what, this is something that is just so abhorrent that I mean, people need [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2213.28s)]
*  to really be held accountable, free burger thoughts. What would you guys do if you're [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2219.6000000000004s)]
*  sitting in a policymaker seat today, and you're being offered by scientists, this ability to go [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2223.6000000000004s)]
*  and figure out what the next big virus will be, and start to make plans for getting in front of it [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2230.32s)]
*  by understanding the biology of these viruses, by seeing where they're going to evolve to, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2235.44s)]
*  and by trying to get in front of the next pandemic so that we can protect the population? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2239.76s)]
*  Do you guys support that sort of research? And what are the questions you ask? So let's rewind [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2245.36s)]
*  15 years, pretend Fauci doesn't get to make those decisions, you guys are the policymakers. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2249.92s)]
*  And folks say, SARS just happened. We want to do this research, we want to figure out [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2254.5600000000004s)]
*  how to get free, what do you do? And how do you answer that? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2259.1200000000003s)]
*  There's a really simple question. If anybody who's watched any kind of science fiction or knows the [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2261.44s)]
*  history of this kind of research, which is don't do this in a population center, and how will you [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2266.4s)]
*  prevent it from breaking out? Like literally, that's job one. If you're going to, even if you're not [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2272.08s)]
*  going to, like literally every science fiction film has this, it's like put it on an island, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2278.2400000000002s)]
*  and there's an island off Long Island where they keep these things. I forgot the name of it, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2283.76s)]
*  it's Plum Island or something. Well, look it up. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2287.36s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, there are internal NIH emails that suggest that COVID leaked from a [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2289.6s)]
*  level two facility, they call it BSL2, which does not operate with the top level biohazard [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2296.4s)]
*  safeguards. So they knew the Wuhan lab was not at the level of safeguards that it should have been. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2302.56s)]
*  But look, I would go deeper and say that why would you do this kind of research at all? I mean, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2307.8399999999997s)]
*  you are deliberately manipulating viruses in order to make them transmissible in humans. This was a [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2312.64s)]
*  bat virus that was not transmissible to humans. It was bioengineered, they had the fur and cleavage [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2318.72s)]
*  site to allow it to gain access to human cells. Yeah. So Sachs, I am going to push back because [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2324.7999999999997s)]
*  that is not conclusively true. What you're saying is something that some people have claimed, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2330.3999999999996s)]
*  but there are other scientists, including papers published recently in the Lancet and other like [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2335.8399999999997s)]
*  pretty reputable, like medical journals and research journals that indicate that the evolution [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2340.3999999999996s)]
*  seen in the fur and cleavage site can be traced back to an evolutionary origin, not necessarily [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2345.28s)]
*  to a human engineered origin. So I want to just make that clear that that is a possibility. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2350.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm not dismissing it, but I'm not supporting the other side. I'm saying we have work to do to [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2354.2400000000002s)]
*  figure this out. Okay. Just to be clear. It's a possibility that's so remote. I mean, look, I [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2357.76s)]
*  heard Professor Jeffrey Sachs talking about this in a recent interview and he went through the whole [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2362.2400000000002s)]
*  history. He said there's like 200 of these coronaviruses in this like class or category, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2366.7200000000003s)]
*  and there's not one fur and cleavage site among any of them. So can you say that there's not a [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2372.7999999999997s)]
*  one in a billion chance of it happening? So back to your question. It's a very, very, very low [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2377.92s)]
*  probability event. Let me punch up your question, Freberg, because if you have your question is, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2384.08s)]
*  what should you do? I want to ask you guys, what do you do? So like forget about, oh, there's bad [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2387.8399999999997s)]
*  guys. Fauci's a bad guy. Like, what do you do to protect the world against the next pandemic? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2391.7599999999998s)]
*  Number one, you don't do this type of gain of function research. Number two, if you are going [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2396.7999999999997s)]
*  to do it, you don't do it at a level two facility like the Wuhan lab. Number three, when the virus [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2400.72s)]
*  leaks in the lab, you don't basically lie about it and conduct a coverage campaign that smears [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2407.52s)]
*  the reputation of honest scientists. Number four, when you're hauled into the Oval Office in response [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2412.8799999999997s)]
*  to this once in a century pandemic, you don't pretend like you're America's doctor and you [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2419.6s)]
*  have all the answers. And in fact, you're the guy who created this problem. You own it. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2425.04s)]
*  There's an idea, you own it. And you know what, like, the question really in embedded in your [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2430.72s)]
*  question, Freberg, I think is, is gain? Or is there any argument to doing gain of function? If so, how? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2436.3999999999996s)]
*  And then is there any reason to research, you know, the bat dung or whatever material they get it from, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2442.0s)]
*  you know, from those caves and take it out of the caves? I could see the latter chamoff of like, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2448.24s)]
*  hey, this existed nature, you studied on an island somewhere far away from everybody [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2453.2s)]
*  with massive controls. The gain of function seems like it literally feels like the speech [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2457.84s)]
*  from Jurassic Park. Like, I think it's why would you do this? And Jurassic Park took place on an [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2463.04s)]
*  island for a reason. There were many scientists who are opposed to gain function research. They [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2467.6800000000003s)]
*  thought it was unduly risky and didn't have offsetting benefits. And that is exactly why [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2471.6000000000004s)]
*  Obama banned it. Very good decision. To me, this whole idea that we need to amplify these viruses [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2476.4s)]
*  in order to find out what would happen if this happened naturally is insane. You didn't have [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2484.96s)]
*  this derangement until you created it. Yes. This is not nutty. This is nuts. Go ahead. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2490.48s)]
*  There are examples we know. I'll just point to two. Let's just say the attempted overthrow [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2496.08s)]
*  of the Ukrainian government in 2014. You can go back to Iran Contra as yet another example. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2501.84s)]
*  And you can add gain of function research now, which is again, I'll just go back to when there [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2508.2400000000002s)]
*  are these lifelong bureaucrats that believe they're above the law. That there's this sensation that [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2514.16s)]
*  they can pull the levers of power silently behind the scenes because they know better. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2521.12s)]
*  And then what they're doing, as you guys said, is they are controverting the desires of the people. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2527.12s)]
*  So whether you like President Obama or not, he's duly elected by the people. And when he says this [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2534.3199999999997s)]
*  isn't allowed, it shouldn't be allowed. And when you instantiate chaos and wars and all of this [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2539.52s)]
*  other stuff, overthrows in all of these other places that then create all these long tail effects, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2546.96s)]
*  they're not done with really America's support. They're done by a small group of people who think [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2552.72s)]
*  they know better. And I think that we've created that kind of a problem that needs to get fixed. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2557.68s)]
*  And so I think that this has to be an example where you can make them an example. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2563.36s)]
*  Because otherwise it will keep happening. And there are other parts of the American bureaucracy [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2569.52s)]
*  where people are in charge of very critical and important decisions. And I suspect 99% of them are [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2574.72s)]
*  good, earnest, honest people doing the right thing for America. But it's just the law of large [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2581.04s)]
*  numbers. There will be one or two, and all it takes is one or two, who get drunk with that power. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2587.12s)]
*  And so unless that there's a check and balance on that dynamic, we'll have more issues of this. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2592.72s)]
*  And as the world gets more sophisticated, and we rely more on experts, I hate to say this, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2598.16s)]
*  guys, but you have to be more skeptical of experts. As much as you think an expert is an expert, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2604.56s)]
*  you have to fight the tendency of saying, I'm going to abdicate all of my intellect [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2610.16s)]
*  onto you and you decide. Yeah. I think you have to find a way of just gut checking. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2614.7999999999997s)]
*  And Sack said this critical thing. If I was the president of the United States in a pandemic, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2620.3999999999996s)]
*  I didn't need the COVID to teach me this example. But if I'm trying to solve a very technical and [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2625.52s)]
*  hard engineering problem, what I always do is I bring a cross section of people in a room. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2631.52s)]
*  Typically, some of them have to have disagreeing opinions, and I make them intellectually fight [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2637.8399999999997s)]
*  it out. And my job is to observe. And in that, I apply my judgment. I'm not nearly as smart as them, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2643.12s)]
*  I'm not nearly technically as trained as them, but that is a process that works. And I'm just [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2649.68s)]
*  questioning, it couldn't have happened here. Because as Sack said, if you basically bury the [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2654.48s)]
*  reputations of the folks that are pushing back, you could never bring them inside the room in the [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2659.12s)]
*  Oval and have a conversation with them and say, Hey, Jay, but to charia, give us the red team [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2663.84s)]
*  version of what you think is happening. Yeah. And that is a real argument. Steel man the opposite [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2669.52s)]
*  side. Let me build on a point Jamoth made, which is, I think we have to ask the question, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2674.64s)]
*  what type of government do we really have? You know, we call ourselves a democracy, but are you [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2679.76s)]
*  a democracy when the elected leaders come and go and the really powerful bureaucrats running the [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2685.1200000000003s)]
*  government running these agencies stay for decades and decades. And if the president disagrees with [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2691.6000000000004s)]
*  their policy, they can just wait them out. Fauci wanted to do gain a function research, maybe by [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2696.8s)]
*  the way, at the behest of DoD, we don't know, it could have been a bio weapon or bio defense [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2702.6400000000003s)]
*  program. There's a lot more to this that we don't even know about yet. In any event, it's clear he [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2706.96s)]
*  was passionately committed to funding gain a function research. He just waited for his opportunity [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2712.0s)]
*  and implemented as well. Victoria Newland in the state department passionately committed to [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2717.68s)]
*  basically bringing Ukraine into NATO and using that to essentially provoke a regime change [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2722.96s)]
*  operation in Russia. Again, she just had to wait for her opportunity to basically keep pushing these [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2729.76s)]
*  policies for decades. These are the people who are really running the American government. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2735.44s)]
*  How would you change it? We have to turn these things over these organizations or get rid of [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2740.56s)]
*  them. We talk about term limits for politicians, maybe we actually need turn limits for the [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2744.0s)]
*  administrative apparatchik that runs all these critical organizations. Right. It's called the [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2748.0s)]
*  deep state, right? You ever hear the expression deep state sounds conspiratorial. It's not. It's [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2752.64s)]
*  just the permanent bureaucracy. We elect a president, but how many people does the president actually [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2757.04s)]
*  appoint? A couple of hundred? 99.9% of the people running the government are there permanently. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2762.4s)]
*  Well, and then I'll just say here, I want to give a shout out to the journalists, Catherine [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2769.28s)]
*  Iban and Emily Kopp. I know that people also have no faith in journalists. These are two [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2774.7200000000003s)]
*  journalists I think you could have tremendous faith in and who are going to win Pulitzers [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2779.52s)]
*  because they've been doggedly pursuing this. You have to wonder why this is not the top story on [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2782.96s)]
*  the news networks and why this isn't the head of the New York Times or the Washington Post. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2789.04s)]
*  There needs to be much more coverage of what's going on here. I don't understand why this isn't [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2794.1600000000003s)]
*  what we're doing. Yeah, because the New York Times takes every headline. Yeah. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2797.76s)]
*  I don't think it has anything to do with Trump. I think it's got everything to do with the fact [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2801.36s)]
*  that the New York Times was covering for Fauci. Fauci has been there for decades. He is a major [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2803.76s)]
*  source for the New York Times, just like he was a major funder of grant programs, right? So there's [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2811.12s)]
*  a lot of people who have developed a dependency on Fauci. I mean, everyone. You think access [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2815.68s)]
*  journalism is what's going on here. He gave them access. There's no question that the New York Times [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2821.8399999999997s)]
*  was covering for this. The New York Times definitely promoted the idea that anyone [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2826.3199999999997s)]
*  pushing the lab leak theory was somehow conspiracy theorist or a nut. And you have to lay on [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2830.72s)]
*  top of all this acts in the political environment. They were pushing that whole crazy wet market [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2836.7999999999997s)]
*  theory. Well, the wet market theory. The Penguin. Remember the Penguin? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2841.04s)]
*  We needed Jon Stewart to dismantle the Penguin theory. You know, in relation to that, these wet [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2846.8s)]
*  markets have spread massive viruses and all kinds of things. And they do need to be. There was like [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2851.84s)]
*  a UN report on the K we have to upgrade. That's why it was a great cover story. I think it was a [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2860.2400000000002s)]
*  logical theory to pursue to the end point of eliminating it because they around will hand. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2866.24s)]
*  There are a lot of these wet markets. It is completely conceivable that a person who was in [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2872.3199999999997s)]
*  that lab went to a wet market and it's spread via the wet market. This is why we need a full [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2877.7599999999998s)]
*  investigation folks, because all these theories could come together and there are more cards to [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2881.7599999999998s)]
*  turn over, which one of you alluded to, like, who knows what the turn in the river are going to be [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2886.3999999999996s)]
*  here. Like, what did China know? What did our government and China know? Maybe they are making [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2891.44s)]
*  bio weapons. Maybe they're doing even worse stuff that we don't know about. Maybe there's all kinds [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2896.64s)]
*  of rogue programs that are being, that are occurring here. That's why we need to keep digging and [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2901.84s)]
*  digging. The American public must hold these people accountable and they need to tell us [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2906.08s)]
*  who else was involved. Because if Fauci is involved and this guy's involved, there's other people. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2912.4s)]
*  I want to hear from everybody. There's many crazy parts of this, but I think maybe the craziest [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2916.96s)]
*  part of the whole thing is that when the pandemic happens and the elected government of the United [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2920.64s)]
*  States, the president needs to pull in the resources to manage a policy response, who do [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2926.64s)]
*  they pull in? Fauci, the guy who created the problem. It's kind of like when they have Newland [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2931.44s)]
*  be our chief diplomat in the state department and she's fomented the coup in Kiev in 2014. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2936.48s)]
*  It's again, these bureaucrats are doing the exact opposite of what they're supposed to be doing. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2942.48s)]
*  They're not protecting public health. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2947.8399999999997s)]
*  They have to take ownership of this and being honest. Yes. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2949.12s)]
*  But I think to answer your question, what do we do about it? I think we just got to clean out [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2950.8799999999997s)]
*  the stables here. I think we just got to disband some of these government departments. Why do we [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2953.9199999999996s)]
*  have so many? This whole alphabet soup of three-letter agencies. I think Vivek Ramaswamy had the right [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2958.3999999999996s)]
*  idea. Let's get rid of a bunch of these things. Zero base budget, the whole government. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2963.52s)]
*  Start over and just go right through each one. And you know what? It should be a bipartisan issue, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2968.48s)]
*  but there's so much money involved. This is one of the challenges in the capitalist system. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2973.44s)]
*  Is there so much money? There's so much grift to go around that when something like this happens [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2977.12s)]
*  and there's an opportunity to, I don't know, make a vaccine and put a couple of billion dollars into [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2981.92s)]
*  this light speed thing, which was a great idea, seemingly everybody lines up. Okay. Yeah, sure. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2988.48s)]
*  We'll get involved. We'll take some of that money. Yeah. Buy a billion shots from us. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2993.12s)]
*  President Trump was really onto this because he's the one that really coined the term the deep state [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=2996.64s)]
*  and went after it. And if you think about the other side, the people that are there, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3000.72s)]
*  it must be very discomforting to hear because a lot of those people are folks that worked hard, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3005.2s)]
*  tried to go to good schools, get educated, and join an infrastructure to move a country forward [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3011.2s)]
*  because they believe in the country and the values of America. Sounds like a noble mission, right? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3017.68s)]
*  But over long periods of time, most people come and go, and then there's a small cohort of folks [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3021.36s)]
*  that sort of end up ossifying and running the top parts of this permanent bureaucracy. And [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3027.6s)]
*  I think Sachs is right. They start to observe just the simple principle that [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3033.84s)]
*  all these folks come and go, yet I'm still around. President comes, president goes, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3038.6400000000003s)]
*  undersecretary comes, undersecretary goes, the secretary of this comes, then they go. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3043.52s)]
*  And so they start to believe that they're really in charge. And that's where [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3048.6400000000003s)]
*  the deep state idea comes from. At least we're in a democracy where these [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3052.6400000000003s)]
*  hearings are occurring. I just want to give kudos to, in addition to those two journals, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3058.08s)]
*  to the people on this subcommittee who are doing it in a bipartisan way, and they will be, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3062.32s)]
*  and they're being relentless. I think that's the honorable thing to do. I encourage them [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3067.6000000000004s)]
*  and those investigative journalists to be relentless. And kudos to Rand Paul too. Remember when he was- [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3071.92s)]
*  Rand, I mean, profile and courage. People were like, this guy's a loon. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3077.36s)]
*  No, Rand Paul had a run. But to your point about what does this mean for our democracy, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3080.7200000000003s)]
*  I want to just bring up the Summifor article where they polled young people and young voters, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3084.7200000000003s)]
*  they despair over US politics. They describe the United States as a dying empire led by bad people. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3090.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean- [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3098.0s)]
*  After what we've learned about COVID, and I would argue also the whole background- [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3098.3199999999997s)]
*  They're not wrong. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3103.3599999999997s)]
*  ... War, is this right? Exactly. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3103.9199999999996s)]
*  Their intuition is right. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3106.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3109.12s)]
*  From the mouths of babes. I mean, bad is, I mean, if they covered this up in the way it's looking [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3109.4399999999996s)]
*  like, I would call this behavior not bad. I'd call it evil because it was premeditated. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3115.2799999999997s)]
*  And then look, the point is we're supposed to have this check and balance from the media, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3119.36s)]
*  but when the media is complicit because they like to be in those halls of power, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3123.6800000000003s)]
*  that's where these feelings come from. I think the latest stat that I saw is I think [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3127.1200000000003s)]
*  more than 52% of Americans now believe that the mainstream media is untrustworthy. And that's a [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3131.6s)]
*  really terrible place to be, which means you're basically- [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3138.2400000000002s)]
*  Where do you get truth? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3140.88s)]
*  You're consuming something that's just fundamentally not true. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3141.76s)]
*  I mean, burn it down. I mean, that's the conclusion any logical person would come to is just burn it [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3144.0s)]
*  down. This makes no sense that they would try and cover this up. The right thing for Fauci to do is [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3148.72s)]
*  say, Hey, listen, we didn't do gain a function, you know, under Obama, we did do it here. It's [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3152.8799999999997s)]
*  obviously been a mistake. We need to never do it again. And here's the roadmap to make sure that [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3160.08s)]
*  we protect people from the next one. Thank God this one didn't kill children the way it's killing [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3164.64s)]
*  all people. And by the way, this is going to crack open. I encourage you all to be vocal about this [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3168.3999999999996s)]
*  and to watch on Monday because Dr. Fauci is scheduled to appear in a hearing for the same [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3172.8799999999997s)]
*  subcommittee and that is going to be explosive. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3178.48s)]
*  Livestreamed on YouTube. We'll put the link in the show notes. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3181.68s)]
*  Since we're in the don't trust anybody and have your own sovereignty and we're in libertarian [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3184.88s)]
*  moment, let's go to our crypto correspondent. It's crypto corner with Chema. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3189.92s)]
*  It's part of my production company. I'm now doing crypto corner with Chema. That'll be next week's [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3198.64s)]
*  called open. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3202.48s)]
*  I thought it would be good to talk about crypto for a couple of reasons. One [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3203.36s)]
*  is because we just had the halving at the end of April. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3209.1200000000003s)]
*  When did that happen? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3211.76s)]
*  The halving is where just for folks that don't know the way that bitcoins are created is by [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3213.0400000000004s)]
*  solving these complex mathematical algorithms that take a lot of time and energy and money. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3217.52s)]
*  And when you solve it, you get rewarded with some number of Bitcoin. And roughly every four years, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3222.7200000000003s)]
*  that reward gets cut in half. It's called the having. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3229.68s)]
*  This week, I saw somebody who reminded me all of this and I just want to give this guy a [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3235.6s)]
*  proper shout out. So his name is Wences Casares and Wences in Silicon Valley, I would say really [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3240.16s)]
*  was agent zero of Bitcoin. He was the one in 2010 that introduced it to me. I remember [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3245.7599999999998s)]
*  he reminded me of the story. Actually, we were at Oran's Hummus and he's like, he's Argentinian. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3252.24s)]
*  He's a great so I'm going to try to copy his accent. You have to buy the Bitcoin. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3257.6s)]
*  So I heard the story. I fell in love with it. I remember I called my family office. I'm like, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3261.68s)]
*  buy me a million of these things. And he was like, or a million dollars worth. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3265.7599999999998s)]
*  And he was like, Are you crazy? And I was like, No, there's just a little appetizer. We'll get to the [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3269.36s)]
*  main main course. Anyways, he has done a phenomenal job of understanding and proselytizing [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3274.0s)]
*  Bitcoin. I want to thank him because he really put me on to this. But he mentioned something to me [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3279.8399999999997s)]
*  when I saw him a couple days ago, which is you should really look at the pattern of Bitcoin [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3285.84s)]
*  after a halving. And so I was really curious. And so I had a guy on my team, Quinton put this [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3291.2000000000003s)]
*  together. So Nick, let me just let's go to the first page. So why is this interesting? So here's [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3297.52s)]
*  a little Bitcoin price analysis for you guys. So there's been a couple of halving cycles that [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3302.48s)]
*  have happened. And I asked him to go back and look at the price performance one month after a having [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3307.6000000000004s)]
*  three months, six months, nine months, 12 months, and 18 months after a halving. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3314.48s)]
*  And what you notice is that there are these moments, initially, where essentially when you [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3319.36s)]
*  go through a Bitcoin halving, people are sort of reassessing what's happening. And they're trying [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3326.96s)]
*  to figure it out. That's sort of what I would say is happens in the first month and roughly what also [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3332.48s)]
*  happens in the first three months. But then within six months to a year and 18 months of these things, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3336.56s)]
*  there are these crazy price appreciation cycles that happen. So that's what this page shows, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3343.36s)]
*  which is, you know, 18 months after the first halving, the Bitcoin price returned 45x. After [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3350.08s)]
*  the second halving, it returned almost 28x. And after this third halving, it returned almost an [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3359.2000000000003s)]
*  8x, which is really incredible returns in such a short period of time. If you go to the next page. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3366.6400000000003s)]
*  And so if you graph that, this is what it starts to show, which is what is this price performance [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3371.52s)]
*  after each of these halving cycles. Now, why is that interesting? Well, it's interesting because [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3376.0s)]
*  on top of this halving, which theoretically, if history is a guide, we should see some price [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3381.7599999999998s)]
*  appreciation. Obviously, the other thing that's happened is we've commercialized Bitcoin. And we [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3389.84s)]
*  talked about this sort of as my big prediction for 2024, which is these ETFs are really going to allow [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3393.6s)]
*  Bitcoin to cross the chasm and have its sort of central key moment, right? And so if you apply [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3400.72s)]
*  the averages, and again, these are just averages, they're by no means predictions. Okay, so I just [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3407.04s)]
*  want to qualify that this is not financial advice. It's not financial advice. These are just, yes, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3411.68s)]
*  we took these and we applied it to the price of Bitcoin. And if you go to the next page, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3417.3599999999997s)]
*  you start to see what could happen if you just take the average of the last few cycles. So because [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3421.7599999999998s)]
*  the first cycle was so extreme, and you start to apply- So you're just doing cycle two and three [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3428.24s)]
*  here, to be clear. Just the averages of cycle two and three. And what you start to see is some [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3433.04s)]
*  really meaningful appreciation. And when I talked to Wences about this, how he explained it, which [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3437.52s)]
*  makes a lot of sense to me is there are a lot of countries that will never look at Bitcoin credibly, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3445.2s)]
*  even if they support it. The US may be one of those, but there is an increasing body of countries [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3452.4799999999996s)]
*  that will become dual currency. And they will look at their local currency, and then they will look [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3457.6800000000003s)]
*  at Bitcoin. And they will say both of these two things are needed. One, when you're transacting [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3463.76s)]
*  on a daily basis for random goods and services. And two, when you need to buy a permanent asset [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3468.7200000000003s)]
*  that needs to have residual value, you'll use something like BTC. And I think that's a very [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3474.1600000000003s)]
*  powerful concept. And if you look at what this price chart could indicate, is that if this thing [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3479.12s)]
*  starts to get to these levels of appreciation, it is going to completely replace gold and start to [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3487.92s)]
*  become something that has transactional utility for hard assets. And I think if you marry that [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3493.68s)]
*  with this worry that some folks have about dollar debasement, you start to see some really interesting [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3500.72s)]
*  opportunities. So I just thought that this was an interesting thing that he put me on. I thought [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3506.56s)]
*  I'd share that with you. I'll publish this on Twitter, but that's your crypto corner for the year, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3513.44s)]
*  folks. I think it's really interesting how the crypto community is getting organized into [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3517.68s)]
*  basically a lobby to advocate for its interests. It's the biggest lobby in America. Did you know [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3523.04s)]
*  that? Yeah, they've been so targeted over the last few years because Gensler and Warren have been on [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3528.64s)]
*  a crusade to basically make crypto illegal or drive it offshore. Well, every action has an equal [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3534.88s)]
*  and opposite reaction. And now the crypto people have basically had a political awakening and [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3541.12s)]
*  realize they have to get involved in the political system. This is a matter of defense, self defense. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3545.52s)]
*  Shout out SPF. So they're getting a pioneer. Well, not like that. I mean, that guy, I mean, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3551.28s)]
*  he was dropping money on everybody. Yeah. Did you guys hear this? Did you hear this rumor that he [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3557.2000000000003s)]
*  was doing that to basically push for regulatory capture? Remember? Yeah. I think it's a nuance [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3561.76s)]
*  point. Did you guys hear this? Did you guys hear this rumor that SPF was going to put a billion [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3567.44s)]
*  dollars into the election and convince Tom Brady to run as a Republican and give the no give the [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3572.4s)]
*  billion to Trump? Oh, sorry, give the billion to Trump. He was going to give Trump a billion to [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3577.2000000000003s)]
*  not run. Okay. And then get Tom Brady to run. I mean, this person had delusions of gravity. He [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3581.28s)]
*  thought he was a Jedi Knight. And he's like literally in Jabba's balance right now. I don't [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3586.7200000000003s)]
*  know what this I mean, what a lunatic he was. I mean, talk about delusions of grandeur sacks. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3591.12s)]
*  This guy thought he would just drop a billion dollars and convince somebody not to run for [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3595.92s)]
*  government. I think we're gonna I think we're gonna get a regulatory, you know, back to the [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3600.72s)]
*  young people we talked about in the previous story. I think the reason they're attracted to crypto [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3604.96s)]
*  is because it doesn't have government control. And since if you don't trust the government, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3610.08s)]
*  and you see the government over and over and over again, cover things up or the grift or make [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3613.92s)]
*  decisions that are not in your generation's best interest, why wouldn't you opt out of their [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3619.12s)]
*  financial system? And you know what, there's a lot of them. And they have they're getting organized [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3623.2s)]
*  to your point, sacks. I think we're going to have a crypto framework. And it's worth probably five [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3627.68s)]
*  points in this election. What do you think, sacks? How many points is being the pro crypto candidate [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3634.56s)]
*  worth in this election? 123 points of votes, four points, it's gotta be some it's hard to [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3638.64s)]
*  quantify. It'll be it'll be it could be 500 basis points. I mean, young people do not show up to [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3644.88s)]
*  vote because there isn't an issue that they care about. Correct. But there's 50 million Americans [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3650.2400000000002s)]
*  that own crypto 5050. Okay, so if 10% of them are like, let's say that's their single issue, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3654.6400000000003s)]
*  that's 5 million votes. No, no, no. There's a there's a plausible case where 40 million of [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3661.12s)]
*  those folks show up because you're talking about a structural part of their wealth creation. Right. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3666.88s)]
*  So for example, like, you know, Biden, President Biden talked about giving people a head start by [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3672.0s)]
*  eliminating their debt. That's a narrow issue. And the reason it's a narrow issue, there's just [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3676.48s)]
*  as many people that don't have debt and just as many people that paid off their debt, and it [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3681.28s)]
*  creates a lot of haves and have nots. Right. And there's all these rules around who will get the [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3684.56s)]
*  debt relief, etc. You end up touching four or 5 million people maximum. But if there are 50 million [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3690.64s)]
*  people who have now decided to have at least the hedge against the establishment and the traditional [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3697.76s)]
*  financial system, and you are threatening to take that wealth away, yeah, I could see how 80% of [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3705.28s)]
*  those folks show up to the ballot box and say, All right, which one of you will just leave me alone? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3711.76s)]
*  And if the answer is President Trump, then they're all going to vote for President Trump. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3716.0800000000004s)]
*  I think this is like such a great issue for political candidates to embrace. And it's just [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3719.2000000000003s)]
*  such a simple framework. I've said it a dozen times, create a sophisticated investor test, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3724.88s)]
*  let 1000 flowers bloom, people can make whatever crypto projects they want. But to buy it, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3730.1600000000003s)]
*  you just have to take a simple test like a driver's license so that you don't risk your entire net [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3735.2000000000003s)]
*  worth or whatever. If you do, you're an informed buyer of crypto, just make a sophisticated investor [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3741.04s)]
*  test. And let's move on. Chamath, just since we're in crypto corner, before we leave crypto corner, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3745.6800000000003s)]
*  when is my ape going to be worth money again? When will my ape go back up? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3749.76s)]
*  Never. So my apes not coming back. Okay, so I guess I shouldn't have done that. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3753.44s)]
*  All right. How's the sax coin doing? We had sax coin and we had [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3759.2000000000003s)]
*  went crazy. But that was a pump and dump scheme that we had nothing to do with I will never sell [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3764.88s)]
*  you a coin. Until I do. I just want to let everybody know that if you get a DM for me, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3769.28s)]
*  I am not selling j coin until you hear it first. I would literally do an angel investing coin [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3774.7200000000003s)]
*  immediately if there was a framework for it. It would be the greatest idea ever to have like a [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3782.4s)]
*  j coin and I could just like put it into startups and people could buy and sell it and be like this [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3786.88s)]
*  ongoing evergreen venture. Where's my J Dow? I love Dows and I love I love the idea of an [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3790.4s)]
*  angel investing coin. But man, a startup coin would be brilliant. Yeah, the Jason coin is basically [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3798.48s)]
*  at zero it man it was worth the sax coin is down to eight grand. Yeah, to be clear, I didn't know [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3804.08s)]
*  anything to do with sax coin either but I was more amused by it than anything else. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3810.08s)]
*  Yeah. Well, my friend decided to tell everybody he was gonna buy some and then straight to the [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3813.7599999999998s)]
*  moon. It's hilarious. I have some I've only we've only bought crypto twice we have some Doge, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3819.04s)]
*  which I bought during like our Doge phase a couple years ago. And then my wife [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3830.72s)]
*  presently bought Bitcoin, you know, at a very low price when everybody was talking around it around [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3837.2s)]
*  Thanksgiving. And my heart Bitcoin went phenomenal and my Doge is at break even now. So I've spent [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3841.8399999999997s)]
*  two years just on the pendulum. But who knows maybe those should become a thing again. I love Doge. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3850.3199999999997s)]
*  All right, we have a bellwether of sorts here. Salesforce dropped more than 20% after reporting [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3855.3599999999997s)]
*  earnings. We should talk about the state of SaaS software as a service if you're not in the industry. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3860.16s)]
*  Salesforce had its worst day in the markets in nearly 20 years on Thursday, and that's when we [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3865.76s)]
*  tape this. It lost about $40 billion in market cap or as we say in the industry to figmas on [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3871.5200000000004s)]
*  Wednesday Salesforce missed q1 revenue estimates for the first time since 2006. Revenue was up 9.1 [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3876.6400000000003s)]
*  billion 11% year over year, but about 40 million below Wall Street expectations. So they're doing [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3882.8s)]
*  great. But Wall Street is concerned for a reason we'll get into what that is net income was 1.5 [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3888.1600000000003s)]
*  billion seven x year over year because they've been doing a lot of cuts over there. Free cash [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3894.72s)]
*  flows, 6 billion up 43% profits are up huge because if you remember those activists investors came in [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3898.7999999999997s)]
*  and had been off really rethink the structure of the business and the footprint of the business. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3905.04s)]
*  But guidance for q2 down Salesforce projecting 7% growth relatively low for them. Freeburg, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3910.64s)]
*  you and I were talking about this like what are your thoughts here on [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3918.3999999999996s)]
*  what's happening in the markets and then we had the side discussion which we didn't dock it but [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3921.44s)]
*  I think it's worth bringing up here in dovetailing which is it does seem like the consumer which is [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3926.88s)]
*  an enterprise story but the economy is cooling off consumers I think are running out of money. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3932.7200000000003s)]
*  The YOLO economy is finally I think at its end. What does this say to you, Freeburg? [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3938.0s)]
*  Well, I think the key question to your point is there a macro economic reason [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3944.88s)]
*  for a slowdown in their business. They're forecasting for this next fiscal year [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3950.16s)]
*  revenue growth of only 8 to 9% and for this next quarter it's basically a flat revenue quarter [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3956.0s)]
*  relative to the past quarter. So for this fiscal year 38 billion of top line revenue, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3961.9199999999996s)]
*  9 billion of operating cash flow and with the market cap coming down by 20% the stocks at a [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3967.9199999999996s)]
*  $200 billion valuation so it's trading at you know call it roughly 20 times their operating cash flow [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3974.24s)]
*  forecast with sub 10% revenue growth and that's basically where treasuries trade right because [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3979.4399999999996s)]
*  treasury yields for 30 year treasury can get 4.7% today. Yeah, it's about say almost 5. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3984.9599999999996s)]
*  You know that's about 20x right so that's about where the multiple is on this Salesforce stock [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3991.2s)]
*  so I think it really begs the question on you know is there a macro economic force where the [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3995.68s)]
*  enterprise is spending less because of you know a revenue slowdown in the economy which we saw in [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=3999.68s)]
*  the latest GDP report that's number one that could be driving this and will affect ultimately the [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4006.16s)]
*  multiple for all these enterprise SaaS companies or number two is there a shifting underway in the [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4010.64s)]
*  SaaS business model that the premium that SaaS companies were able to charge and the pricing [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4015.6s)]
*  model on a per se basis and the dollars that they're able to charge per employee or per user [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4020.3199999999997s)]
*  is so significant relative to what that enterprise can build themselves now with the [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4026.0s)]
*  commoditization available to them under this new era of AI and the ability to build tools internally [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4031.52s)]
*  or the ability for competitors to emerge with significantly underpriced alternatives because [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4037.8399999999997s)]
*  they can use generative AI to make software that can compete. And then there's this other question [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4042.88s)]
*  because Salesforce has been leaning in heavily on the generative AI and the generative AI [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4048.4s)]
*  is leaning in heavily on the generative AI capabilities that they're offering their customers [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4053.2s)]
*  and it seems like the question is are enterprises waiting to see the value of that generative AI [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4059.3599999999997s)]
*  service capability is it worth paying for today should I wait and see or is it actually indicating [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4065.04s)]
*  that there's a big commoditization in generative AI underway? Meaning why do I have to pay Salesforce [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4070.0s)]
*  a bunch of money when I can use some open source third party tool or some more freely available [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4074.64s)]
*  So Chamath Freyberg presented two options here one of them macroeconomic slowdown the other one hey [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4078.7999999999997s)]
*  software you know belt tightening is happening inside the enterprise and it's cheaper to make [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4084.88s)]
*  so maybe we have a deflationary kind of situation inside companies I guess this is adjacent that [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4089.36s)]
*  last part of his theory is adjacent to the 80 90 mission you're on with your new startup [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4096.24s)]
*  and maybe this is this an or or an end in your mind Chamath is it both these things? [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4101.44s)]
*  But sorry before you answer the third point I made was that generative AI [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4105.76s)]
*  generative AI might yes and the third point may not be a product line it may not be enough to [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4109.04s)]
*  charge for given all the open source tools yes and there's a big question mark about the AI [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4112.96s)]
*  new software will people pay for it so Chamath take those three what are your thoughts? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4117.2s)]
*  I think that if you look at what happened before we had [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4121.2s)]
*  a cycle where very large monolithic software was replaced by these SaaS vendors and Salesforce [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4128.320000000001s)]
*  led that charge and they led the in many ways the definition of the cloud so that was amazing [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4134.88s)]
*  that was this one big cycle and before that that monolithic those monolithic software vendors [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4139.6s)]
*  were replacing like mainframes and very archaic stuff this is sort of this third disruptive cycle [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4146.4800000000005s)]
*  we're going to go through a process of ripping and replacing these legacy products and so [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4153.68s)]
*  Gen. AI is just an enablement layer that allows you to deliver functionality to people [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4160.48s)]
*  and I think what you're going to find is that it allows you to deliver that functionality [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4167.36s)]
*  much much cheaper to your point that's the whole point of 80 90 we you know we always joke with [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4171.04s)]
*  Salesforce going to get 80 90 yeah because you can deliver 80% of the features at a 90% discount [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4175.36s)]
*  pretty easily today and what you can't deliver today will get much much easier in a year and [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4181.839999999999s)]
*  two years and three years for sure in 10 years so I think what the market is voting with their [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4187.36s)]
*  dollars is that these large lumpy monolithic software companies that need big 50 100 million [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4195.92s)]
*  dollar customers they're not going to find them soon because those customers will realize that [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4203.92s)]
*  you could get you know what Freeberg said what you need for 10 million or 5 million or 1 million [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4209.44s)]
*  or 500 000 and in some cases free and so the cost structure of your organization makes no sense [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4215.76s)]
*  and so you're going to have to go through this very complicated cycle of recycling [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4223.280000000001s)]
*  you know the business model which unfortunately will mean tons of layoffs and that's not a today [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4227.12s)]
*  thing but over these next five and 10 years that's probably what's going to happen and it doesn't [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4232.56s)]
*  mean Salesforce is a bad company it's just that it is on the wrong side of the life cycle and [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4237.360000000001s)]
*  the odds are overwhelmingly such that a bunch of small companies will flood this opportunity and [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4243.84s)]
*  provide cheaper smaller more flexible capabilities. Sachs obviously you made your bones in the SaaS [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4250.08s)]
*  business over the last two decades at least what are your thoughts here on the challenges I just [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4256.24s)]
*  interviewed Owen McCabe from Intercom and he says he thinks the seat model is going to change and [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4261.92s)]
*  obviously if there's less people at companies there's less seats and that may be a headwind [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4267.84s)]
*  that you just can't win against so maybe a consumption model has to happen or a different [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4272.88s)]
*  pricing model but what are your thoughts on what's happening at Salesforce and then open the aperture [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4276.8s)]
*  there and tell us what you think is going to happen in terms of how corporations either decide [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4281.84s)]
*  to make that you know build or buy decision. Well I think it's pretty amazing that Salesforce lost [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4287.04s)]
*  something like 40 billion of market cap because of a revenue miss of 40 million you know it's amazing [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4293.84s)]
*  how these relatively small in percentage terms misses in revenue or earnings drive such huge [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4300.32s)]
*  changes in market cap. It's quite a ripple isn't it? Yeah I mean look my view is that [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4307.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't have a strong view about the stock but my sense is probably a buying opportunity I mean I [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4314.16s)]
*  think Salesforce is still a great company Mark Benioff is a great CEO he's always positioned the [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4319.44s)]
*  company to chase after whatever the current thing is so obviously he was one of the first to [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4324.24s)]
*  realize that software was headed to the cloud evangelized for the cloud then when the social [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4332.08s)]
*  networking revolution happened he launched chatter which was a competitor to my product [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4339.599999999999s)]
*  Yammer back then but he was ahead of the curve on on social in the enterprise then it was big data [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4343.599999999999s)]
*  and they launched Einstein now they've got AI and they're going to be doing a bunch of different [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4349.2s)]
*  things there so my guess is he's going to figure out how to take advantage of this this AI trend [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4353.76s)]
*  for the company they're not going to miss it they're not going to get caught totally flat-footed [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4360.320000000001s)]
*  so you look I don't have a super strong point of view on it as an investment but [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4365.360000000001s)]
*  what about the bigger picture open the aperture there with the well I think the bigger picture [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4371.76s)]
*  pricing and how many people work at these companies and then if the per se model is the model and then [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4376.0s)]
*  people are going to have less humans working at companies and do more with less how does that mean [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4381.2s)]
*  for SaaS writ large I'm honestly not worried about the per se model I mean the point of a pricing [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4385.599999999999s)]
*  plan should be to align revenue expansion with ROI meaning the more value that a customer gets [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4391.44s)]
*  from your product the more they're willing to pay and you just need some proxy for measuring that [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4400.16s)]
*  seats are a good proxy it's a good way to measure how much value the customer is getting out of your [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4405.5199999999995s)]
*  product because the more seats they're buying the more value they must be getting yes you could do [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4410.88s)]
*  it some other way you could basically meter data usage you could meter API usage sure those models [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4415.12s)]
*  will work for other kinds of companies but I don't think there's going to be a huge disruption [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4422.24s)]
*  to the seat model is my sense look I think the bigger issue here is that their forecast was [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4427.2s)]
*  saw right they are forecasting what sub 10% revenue growth they're going to and this is why [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4434.24s)]
*  the stock got punished and I'm seeing that a bunch of SaaS companies are kind of hurting today now in [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4440.96s)]
*  the wake of this they're down like five percent not 20 but so I wonder if what the market is [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4447.36s)]
*  wondering is whether there's a more general slowdown that we're on the precipice of I don't [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4454.16s)]
*  think that that explains 40 to a 20 drop in a day I think typically these public market investors [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4459.28s)]
*  internalize a bunch of fears and they don't execute on those fears and then when given an [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4467.04s)]
*  opportunity they just barf it all out because it's like now it's acceptable and so to your point [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4472.8s)]
*  David like it was such like a an insignificant revenue miss so as to not even be important [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4478.48s)]
*  quite honestly but the reason it's down 20 percent is I think folks have internalized a different [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4484.16s)]
*  set of risks and then they've found an escape hatch where they have plausible deniability for [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4488.88s)]
*  selling that's just what a lot of public market investors do I don't think it's a coincidence [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4493.92s)]
*  that we just had the GDP forecast revised down for the latest quarter what was it it's down to like [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4497.68s)]
*  1.4 percent something yeah we talked about this last week because it's this number's fake that [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4504.0s)]
*  number is looking pretty soft right now which is I guess a good jumping off point which is what do [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4509.2s)]
*  we think is happening here with the economy and then interest rates because the whole goal here [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4516.64s)]
*  was to get us under you know get us close to two percent get rid of the free handle at least [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4521.84s)]
*  in terms of interest going up and maybe get the consumers to not be spending so much money which [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4526.400000000001s)]
*  is crazy to think about or maybe get more people laid off and have the unemployment not so low [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4533.12s)]
*  remember when everyone was talking about soft landing yeah the reason why they were having [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4536.88s)]
*  that conversation is because the fed jacked up interest rates really suddenly from roughly zero [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4540.96s)]
*  to five five and a half percent and it worked that has an impact on people's consumption because [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4545.92s)]
*  debt is much more expensive so again it's it's worse to buy a house harder to buy a car anything [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4551.76s)]
*  you need to finance gets much harder it took a long time for this to work its way through the [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4556.72s)]
*  economy but I think we're finally seeing it now I think we're I think that's exactly right I think [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4561.52s)]
*  we're here when you see that three handle like does it go down you know it's very interesting [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4565.2s)]
*  about the two percent target I went down the rabbit hole to try to figure out that two percent [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4569.04s)]
*  target likes I was like who came up with two percent as a number like why isn't it three or [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4572.56s)]
*  two point five or one point five or one it's a guy in New Zealand who is you know came up with what [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4577.120000000001s)]
*  he thought was a good target two percent the world adopted it so going back to our conversation about [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4581.76s)]
*  experts yeah but he just really admits it he's just like yeah I just thought three percent seemed [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4586.56s)]
*  like the right number it wasn't too high wasn't too low and it's kind of healthy to have things [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4591.120000000001s)]
*  go up in price because that means like the economy's growing it's it's just a random target two percent [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4595.6s)]
*  was his gut incredible right incredible yeah I mean if you look at this we are at what is it [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4600.72s)]
*  three point six percent annualized CPI inflation and one point three percent annualized GDP growth [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4608.400000000001s)]
*  and a four point seven percent 30-year treasury yield this is I don't know what else is more [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4617.76s)]
*  definitional of stagflation the economy is not growing prices are going up and the cost of borrow [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4623.2s)]
*  has gone through the roof yeah someone's got to give and then also if they keep raising taxes [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4628.8s)]
*  well it's good like their plans are then affluent people are going to be trying to protect their [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4633.92s)]
*  assets and who's they I'm just thinking like a politician like if a politician were to raise [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4639.28s)]
*  taxes dramatically but which I don't want you to have Biden derangement syndrome here sax okay [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4644.88s)]
*  well I can promise you this I don't think Trump's gonna raise taxes but Biden will he has the trifecta [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4651.360000000001s)]
*  absolutely absolutely that's why I'll see you Thursday night with my $50,000 check I can't wait [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4657.120000000001s)]
*  to be there it's gonna easily be paid for by my tax cut just to jump back for a second on the [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4661.200000000001s)]
*  Salesforce point so you know Salesforce faces these challenges but it's still led by Mark Benioff [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4666.72s)]
*  absolutely that dude's tremendous and if you look at the performance of the average public company [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4672.56s)]
*  regardless of the sector that that business operates in that is run by a hired CEO versus [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4678.96s)]
*  run by a founder CEO yeah the founder public companies that have that have gone public achieved [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4684.8s)]
*  a 10 billion dollar market cap and are still founder run as the CEO from there outperform nearly [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4690.88s)]
*  any index you look at okay and this is I think like a really key point you could probably put [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4698.320000000001s)]
*  together I think some people have done this put together a founder portfolio but I wouldn't count [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4704.16s)]
*  out Benioff just because of some of the stuff that we talked about founders founders founders [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4708.72s)]
*  can and will maneuver their way to success that is the hunger of the entrepreneur let's do our [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4714.56s)]
*  draft the one founders you should not bet against which founder would you least want to short [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4720.88s)]
*  Chamath your first in the draft who do you got who would you not want to bet against [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4728.08s)]
*  sorry what do you mean like founders any entrepreneur in history [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4732.0s)]
*  or any know what happened when people tried to short Elon they got incinerated barbecue sauce [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4740.16s)]
*  okay you got you picked Elon in the draft then that's number one Chamath who you got yeah that's [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4744.4s)]
*  easy I would pick him too okay but we got pick somebody else that's why it's a draft he retook [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4748.64s)]
*  Elon I gotta take the next person it could be anybody it doesn't have to be alive doesn't have [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4752.8s)]
*  to be in position right now who would I so sorry what's like what founder would I least likely to [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4756.4s)]
*  short an entrepreneur you least want to short well have you on he took you on okay Lars and [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4763.759999999999s)]

*  all these founders I don't know how to pick one I mean what do you have to go with uh I'm gonna go [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4773.599999999999s)]
*  with uh I'm gonna go with Bill Gates what he's not always talking over anything no I said it could [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4777.36s)]
*  be any time period of time yeah now that you know the stock performance what are you talking about [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4786.08s)]
*  I just think even in the next time you're gonna go out on a limb you're gonna go out on a limb [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4790.16s)]
*  and say that when Bill Gates was doing his legendary run I wouldn't have shorted it [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4798.96s)]
*  absolutely I also wouldn't short Michael Jordan or LeBron James [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4803.76s)]
*  Steph Curry definitely wouldn't get bet against him all right everybody breaking news today in [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4807.280000000001s)]
*  the law being fair I'm sorry today in law fair depending on your view Trump was found guilty on [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4812.24s)]
*  all 34 felony charges you can choose your own framing here some say it's election interference [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4817.52s)]
*  some people are referring to this as the hush money porn star case other people are calling it [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4823.76s)]
*  the deep state law fair case the jury deliberated for about a day and a half trial lasted six weeks [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4828.16s)]
*  include testimony from 20 witnesses key moments seems to have been Trump's CFO Weisselberg who's [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4835.76s)]
*  I think in jail right now for other charges um outlining the terms of the payments to Michael [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4841.36s)]
*  Cohen the uh disgraced lying attorney who recorded Trump's conversations and that's I think all I can [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4848.16s)]
*  tell you about this except for maybe the sentencing is uh coming up it's going to be July 11th which [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4858.08s)]
*  is but four days before the RNC clearly a sad day for America I'm not sure if anybody on the panel [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4864.48s)]
*  has any opinions on the Trump verdict but let's just randomly start with you David any thoughts [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4872.24s)]
*  on Trump being convicted of 34 felonies in this case well first of all in terms of understanding [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4878.16s)]
*  this case I think it's important to understand that both Merrick Garland's DOJ and former [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4885.12s)]
*  Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance they looked at this case they looked at these charges and they passed on [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4890.24s)]
*  bringing this case Alvin Bragg who's a source funded DA he won a hotly contested race to succeed [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4895.84s)]
*  Vance by pledging to get Trump and that's why he brought this case and in order to bring these [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4902.8s)]
*  charges he had to use a creative legal formula that turned a misdemeanor charge of falsifying [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4909.68s)]
*  business records a charge that would have been passed the statute of limitations into a felony [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4915.280000000001s)]
*  by claiming it was in the service of a second crime but he never named exactly what that crime [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4920.56s)]
*  was or proved that it happened and I think it's safe to say that a case like this which is novel [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4925.68s)]
*  and creative and torturous would never have been brought against anybody but Trump now there's [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4931.04s)]
*  about five different grounds for appeal on this number one the judge is a Biden donor with a [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4938.32s)]
*  daughter who works for Biden number two prejudicial and relevant evidence was admitted that should [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4943.2s)]
*  have been excluded including Stormy Daniels testimony number three Trump was not able to [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4948.639999999999s)]
*  call his expert in election law former head of the FEC Bradley Smith number four the prosecution [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4953.44s)]
*  never named the second crime and then number five the judge let the jury pick from a range of options [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4960.16s)]
*  for what the second crime might be including tax crimes which no evidence was presented [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4965.92s)]
*  and federal election crimes which the court had no jurisdiction so my guess is that at the end of the [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4971.2s)]
*  day this case is going to get tossed on appeal but that's probably going to happen after the election [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4976.4800000000005s)]
*  after November 5th and Democrats now have what they wanted they they wanted to get out of this [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4981.04s)]
*  case four words Donald Trump convicted felon and you're going to be hearing that phrase convicted [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4986.4800000000005s)]
*  felon repeated ad nauseam from now until November 5th and I think that's the whole point of this [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4992.16s)]
*  case. Freberg your take. No I mean it felt like this was always a win-win trial for Trump if he gets [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=4997.28s)]
*  convicted then you know the conversation that we're hearing now you know this was an unfair [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5005.28s)]
*  conviction how could they do this this is lawfare and if he doesn't get convicted they tried to [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5011.12s)]
*  burn him at the stake how could they try and do that clearly he's innocent he was made innocent [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5019.280000000001s)]
*  so you know it never really struck me as being a smart I'm not a political guy but the political [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5023.68s)]
*  calculus just seemed off on this entirely it certainly wasn't clear what they were trying [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5028.88s)]
*  to accomplish either way Trump looks good and I think we saw tonight reports that his website [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5033.280000000001s)]
*  for making donations crashed a lot of people started making public statements on Twitter that [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5040.400000000001s)]
*  are not typically Republican donors that they're donating a lot of money to Donald Trump coming out [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5046.48s)]
*  of this and so it is clearly infuriating a lot of people that as Sachs points out you know something [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5051.5199999999995s)]
*  that some people are considering to be you know a bookkeeping or accounting crime has turned into [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5057.44s)]
*  34 felony convictions it feels unfair it feels like the wrong decision and it's going to infuriate [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5062.16s)]
*  people because people worry about the quality of the justice system anyone who's sitting in the [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5068.4s)]
*  middle as an independent or an undecided I think it is much more likely that they are going to have [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5072.0s)]
*  sympathy for Donald Trump coming out of this not admonishment. Srimath your take. I think that if you [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5076.88s)]
*  went into this looking to confirm your hatred of President Trump you were the one that was given [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5081.68s)]
*  red meat and I think that if you were undecided or broke President Trump you probably found more [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5091.52s)]
*  reason to support him for all the reasons that Reebrick said the thing that's unique about this [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5099.76s)]
*  specific trial that I found rather interesting was the diversity of people who just couldn't [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5106.08s)]
*  understand what this trial was about whether it was Bill Barr who worked for him but was not a [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5114.64s)]
*  huge fan of his nor was you know Trump or vice versa right to an Alan Dershowitz to Cyrus Vance [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5121.52s)]
*  you had Democrats and Republicans and independents legal scholars legal experts some who liked [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5129.68s)]
*  President Trump some who did not some who got along with him some who did not some who fought [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5137.360000000001s)]
*  with him some who did not some who got fired by him some who did not and they were all categorically [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5141.120000000001s)]
*  confused about what this whole thing was about I'm not legally well versed enough to understand [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5147.28s)]
*  what it was so as a layman you then tend to go to this next obvious thing which is you have to bucket [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5153.84s)]
*  this decision as here are some experts and what they know is better than what I know and we talked [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5161.44s)]
*  about this earlier on the pod today when it came to Fauci and it turned out to not be so true [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5169.12s)]
*  or you go to this other place where are there systems of government that can be convoluted [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5173.92s)]
*  and turned in the favor of the majority who is in power against someone that they feel is a threat [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5180.32s)]
*  and we've talked about that as well with respect to how some of these governmental institutions [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5186.72s)]
*  have targeted some of our friends so I think that we're in a very precarious moment where [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5190.96s)]
*  the systems of governments in the United States are a little bit more fragile than they were the [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5197.68s)]
*  moment before. Okay if people are wondering what the case is actually about falsifying business [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5202.240000000001s)]
*  records this is a pretty serious crime in New York City basically when people don't keep correct [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5207.360000000001s)]
*  records when they're committing crimes this is taken seriously in New York because it is the [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5214.0s)]
*  financial capital of the world they've got a long history whether it's you know Bernie Madoff or [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5219.6s)]
*  you know Bernie Madoff Enron etc of pursuing these I don't know why this didn't get communicated well [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5226.320000000001s)]
*  to the public but there were obviously tons of business records falsified here and they [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5234.08s)]
*  basically admitted to it Michael Cohen had pleaded guilty to it already and so it really feels like [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5240.08s)]
*  a misdemeanor and then to understand what happened after that there is a law in New York as Sachs [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5245.92s)]
*  correctly pointed out on top of the falsifying of business records which New York takes [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5253.44s)]
*  deadly seriously and they put this in every indictment when people do it because they want [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5257.599999999999s)]
*  the accountants lawyers CFOs to behave themselves and not cheat the public the election interference [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5261.759999999999s)]
*  also taken very seriously in New York there's been tons of cases again typically minor things but [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5270.32s)]
*  people who do things like try to stuff ballots etc and so you put those two together if you [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5275.679999999999s)]
*  do falsifying if you falsify business records and you do it as part of a second crime which he did [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5283.28s)]
*  which he was convicted of then you get these penalties so that is the explanation of the case [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5288.8s)]
*  that was why he was found guilty it's pretty easy to figure this all out if you don't know all this [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5294.0s)]
*  it's because you didn't take the time to read anything about the case in terms of the basic [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5299.12s)]
*  heuristics of it which I think is because people are burned out on this Trump has committed so many [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5305.28s)]
*  misdemeanors and crimes over time that we're kind of used to it and you know my personal take on it [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5310.8s)]
*  and I'll just leave it at this is I think it's going to be a speeding ticket I do think it's [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5316.24s)]
*  going to get overturned I think Trump has done this his whole career I lived in New York all these [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5320.4800000000005s)]
*  real estate guys were doing all these kind of like little ticky tacky cheating things and I do think [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5326.320000000001s)]
*  that this was politically motivated what was the second crime jacob you if you understand [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5332.72s)]
*  election interference election what is that you're not allowed to interfere in the election so [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5338.0s)]
*  the theory here which the you know the the jury unanimously voted in front of [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5343.28s)]
*  in over these six or seven weeks election interference was because Trump was in dire [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5351.28s)]
*  straits he after the access Hollywood tape came out that weekend when he admitted to assaulting [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5359.68s)]
*  women the grab them by the blank came out his team in this case admitted including his assistant [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5367.76s)]
*  Michael Cohen Allen Weisselberg and of course the guy from the national inquirer pecker all of them [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5375.68s)]
*  agreed testified and just were completely honest that this payment and the reason they bought [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5381.68s)]
*  these people off was because they were scared that it would reduce his chances of being elected [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5389.04s)]
*  they were in panic mode they all testified to that the jury found that they committed these crimes [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5395.92s)]
*  the falsifying of business records in order to save his election chances so that is the legal [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5402.88s)]
*  concept this legal concept was available to everybody for the last you know since it's been [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5408.08s)]
*  filed in the New York Times anybody who doesn't read these basic things and comments on this case [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5413.36s)]
*  is just a partisan who doesn't want to accept the reality that these are actual legal concepts that [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5419.84s)]
*  are completely valid now I do think despite all of that and me making it abundantly clear to anybody [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5425.44s)]
*  that you don't want people falsifying business records and you also don't want anybody interfering [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5432.16s)]
*  in elections I do think it was politically motivated so you got to keep two things in [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5437.12s)]
*  your mind at the same time it's politically motivated Trump commits crimes regularly often [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5441.04s)]
*  but they tend to be ticky tacky first you just said it was going to be reversed on appeal so [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5446.88s)]
*  if you're so confident it's a crime then why do you also say it's going to get reversed yeah because [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5451.04s)]
*  I think well I'll let me restate that I think he's going to get a speeding ticket I don't think the [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5454.56s)]
*  case is going to reverse I think there's going to be some sort of a pardon now that this is a state [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5459.76s)]
*  kind of situation so it wouldn't be Biden who would pardon it it would be the the governor and [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5463.76s)]
*  I think what's going to happen is somebody like Trump Teflon Don he's called that for a reason [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5468.32s)]
*  he gets away with it every time he's rich he's powerful like all rich and powerful people [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5473.5199999999995s)]
*  you have to really do something heinous to wind up in jail so I think it's going to be a speeding [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5477.679999999999s)]
*  ticket I do think the the documents cases that one is a pretty legitimate one with obstruction [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5481.44s)]
*  and I do think the election interference those are the two he should be really worried about [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5488.24s)]
*  because if he is found guilty on those those are legit but I do think this country is going to need [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5491.759999999999s)]
*  to come together I hate to be the bigger person here but I do think the company the country needs [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5496.72s)]
*  to get together and get us two new candidates and we can't be having this lawfare and politically [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5501.280000000001s)]
*  motivated lawsuits every time somebody loses or they're afraid of losing an election but let me [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5508.08s)]
*  ask you a question Jason you're a you're a you're a famous successful person and over the next 10 or [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5514.400000000001s)]
*  20 years the odds are pretty good you'll be more famous and more successful say more Chema do you [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5519.4400000000005s)]
*  feel do you feel the less the same or more okay you have to say less same or more okay if somebody [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5525.44s)]
*  in government doesn't like what you're up to after today are you less the same or more in terms of [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5532.48s)]
*  the risk that the laws could be used to fight you I think we're kind of in the same area I think [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5539.12s)]
*  there's always been politically motivated prosecutions that have occurred that's part of you know the flaw [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5546.639999999999s)]
*  in our legal system and I do think appeals pardons exist as the the relief valve for those things and [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5552.64s)]
*  I think for rich and powerful people with great representation they always get off unless they've [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5559.04s)]
*  done something incredibly incredibly heinous and I don't think this is incredibly heinous [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5563.280000000001s)]
*  and so when it's framed as simply oh it's a porn star he banged a porn star who cares it was [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5569.04s)]
*  consensual and she got a payoff or maybe she was extorting him even you know I don't know if [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5575.68s)]
*  those details were ever determined if you could frame it as extortion or not [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5582.64s)]
*  I think none of that matters like this this falsifying business records thing is just [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5587.4400000000005s)]
*  something they did they should just own it they should have just pledded out [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5593.84s)]
*  and it should have probably never been escalated to the next level with the election interference [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5598.0s)]
*  I thought that was a little bit of a stretch but not that much they got escalated because Alvin [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5602.8s)]
*  Brad got elected to pursue this case and that's the only way you could get it from a misdemeanor [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5606.88s)]
*  to a felony yeah exactly so I think that is part of the reason you sound I know you're really [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5611.28s)]
*  giddy about this Jaycock and hearing your voice no I'm not I'm not honestly I wish all you're doing [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5617.68s)]
*  is repeating you're no sorry sax you don't get to say I'm giddy I'm not going to tell you how you [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5622.32s)]
*  feel you don't get to tell me how I feel I actually am sad for America I'm sad for America that Trump [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5626.88s)]
*  and Biden are our choices okay great so speak for yourself not for me okay great well maybe I'm [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5632.8s)]
*  just detecting enthusiasm in your voice I'm not quite sure what it is not at all you're presenting [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5638.16s)]
*  these documents on the screen that are basically from Alvin Bragg's case that's all you're doing [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5642.72s)]
*  is repeating his theory of the case which I must say is extremely tortured and it's novel I don't [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5647.04s)]
*  think a case like this has ever been brought and if you are going to bring a case against a former [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5654.24s)]
*  president it should be for something more than tiki-taki type stuff stuff that you yourself admit [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5658.08s)]
*  is politically motivated it's obvious Bragg was out to get Trump this is a campaign strategy [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5664.16s)]
*  you have to bend the law into a pretzel to create the case that you're describing listen you know I [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5670.72s)]
*  think Trump will continue to do these he's had these long before he was in public office he got [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5677.36s)]
*  tons of speeding tickets like this he'll get them after he's out of office he's always committed [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5682.32s)]
*  crimes he's always done what this reminds me of is you remember Ken Starr and what they went after [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5686.16s)]
*  Bill Clinton for with the whole Monica Lewinsky thing sure and when that Starr report dropped [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5691.04s)]
*  you know and then hundreds of pages of legalities and they described all the perient behavior and [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5695.599999999999s)]
*  you know amazing amounts of detail at the end of the day the American people looked at it and [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5701.5199999999995s)]
*  decided that maybe there's a tawdry element to this but it's personal behavior and after some [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5707.04s)]
*  period of time Clinton's popularity rebounded and he actually gained seats in the midterms [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5713.28s)]
*  because the Republicans overplayed their hand yeah totally and I think in a similar way it's [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5717.92s)]
*  very clear to me and in fact you've already said this is politically motivated and they basically [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5722.32s)]
*  have taken some sort of bookkeeping error that was a misdemeanor that was past the statute of [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5727.28s)]
*  limitations and they've combined it again with this very novel legal theory about somehow committing [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5733.2s)]
*  fought in the election which by the way was not actually proven in the case and as part of the [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5738.4s)]
*  jury instructions again the judge allowed the jury to have a multiple choice on what the second crime [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5743.44s)]
*  was which is what a lot of legal experts think will become the basis for our appeal so again this [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5751.759999999999s)]
*  whole case was tortured it was politically motivated I would go so far as to say it's a sham [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5757.28s)]
*  it's an outrage and I think people are reacting as though it's an outrage and again if you're [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5763.28s)]
*  going to bring a case not just against a former president but the current front runner to be the [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5767.68s)]
*  next president it better be something important not this ticky tacky thing that the way you [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5772.72s)]
*  describe it as being ticky tacky why even waste the public's time with this why even spend all the [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5779.6s)]
*  money pursuing this and I told you why yeah no that's Donald Trump convicted felon that's the [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5784.8s)]
*  reason why the media wants that talking point and by the way if you want to make a switcheroo and [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5790.4800000000005s)]
*  get a different candidate than Joe Biden that's not going to happen now because Democrats in the [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5795.04s)]
*  media think that this is their salvation they know they're running it's not going to be the [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5799.92s)]
*  obstruction case and the January 6th case that is those are legit cases they should have just gone [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5805.76s)]
*  after those because those are the ones that are completely legit but here we are the Democratic [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5810.8s)]
*  Party knows the running-in candidate who can't debate who can't put two sentences together who [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5815.36s)]
*  can barely find his way off a stage whose policies are coming home to roost the economy like we talked [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5819.28s)]
*  on the show is slowing down very rapidly his foreign policy is a disaster but they think that [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5824.96s)]
*  somehow this is going to be his salvation is is being able to say that Donald Trump is a felon [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5831.28s)]
*  that's their plan yeah and I think at the end of the day this is probably not going to work [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5837.4400000000005s)]
*  all right there you have it folks there's your quick hot take around the horn with your bestie [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5842.400000000001s)]
*  on Trump being convicted by a jury in New York today there'll be sentence on July 11th [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5847.4400000000005s)]
*  and we'll see what happens there the market also after we talked about Salesforce a bunch of the [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5854.64s)]
*  SaaS companies took a dive in the after hours Freeberg any thoughts there as we quickly not [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5860.400000000001s)]
*  not just SaaS but also Dell and in particular Dell reported their stock is down 20 percent after [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5865.52s)]
*  hours so I do wonder if there is a slow reckoning underway right now in technology that's as we [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5871.6s)]
*  talked about in the show a function of both kind of an economic slowdown so enterprises making fewer [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5878.64s)]
*  investments but they were they clearly called out the increased cost associated with AI so they are [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5883.28s)]
*  spending quite a lot and their their cogs on AI systems is much higher and so they're showing a [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5889.759999999999s)]
*  lot more cash burn and I think this is a point to must been talking for a while it's unsustainable [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5895.84s)]
*  guys I've been saying this now for a month so let's just be precise again you cannot spend this kind [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5900.8s)]
*  of money and show no incremental revenue potential so while this is incredible for Nvidia the chicken [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5905.679999999999s)]
*  is coming home to lose because if you do not start seeing revenue flow to the bottom line of [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5912.8s)]
*  these companies that are spending 26 billion dollars a quarter the market cap of Nvidia is [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5917.68s)]
*  not what the market capital video should be and all of these other companies are going to get punished [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5923.4400000000005s)]
*  for spending this kind of money now Dell is a unique example in the sense that I actually think [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5928.16s)]
*  it's a beneficiary of spend and I think that it will build data centers and it will actually do [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5932.320000000001s)]
*  well in the move to AI because it's a very smartly positioned pick and shovels provider [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5938.32s)]
*  but the threshold question is where are all these newfangled things that we're supposed to see that [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5945.679999999999s)]
*  justifies 100 billion dollars of chip spending here 200 billion dollars of energy spend 100 [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5950.5599999999995s)]
*  billion dollars of all this other stuff guys this is we're now spending 750 billion dollars this is [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5957.28s)]
*  on the order of a national transfer payment and we've seen nothing to show for it except that you [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5963.04s)]
*  can mimic somebody's voice and you can make like a cat jump on another cat I mean making a developer [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5971.04s)]
*  30 or 40 percent more efficient that's actually legit but I will say I did that hasn't happened [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5977.68s)]
*  yet either no that's totally no no that's happening in startups right now I'm seeing startups with [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5982.0s)]
*  four developers do what just a couple years ago they would need eight to do there and that's the [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5987.2s)]
*  premise of your ad company isn't it I think that developers can go faster with these tools but these [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5991.04s)]
*  are yes but these are aspirational things when you take a for example a 30,000 person company [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=5995.44s)]
*  it is not true that those engineers now are now all of a sudden as productive as 130,000 employees [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6001.44s)]
*  it's not even true that a thousand employee company is as productive as a 4,000 person company [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6006.96s)]
*  and the reason is for one very specific thing even as all of these next generation models get [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6012.4s)]
*  released the practical threshold problem is when you introduce a completely new way of doing things [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6018.72s)]
*  into an existing workforce what happens is people push back and even in the companies that I own [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6026.4800000000005s)]
*  where I could theoretically mandate you must use these tools because I am the owner of this company [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6030.88s)]
*  it doesn't happen and so I think I think what you're really seeing Jason is a few people embrace it [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6036.08s)]
*  those people may be 50 to 100 more productive but when you blend that into the entire workforce [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6042.400000000001s)]
*  it's still a single digit percentage which means the overall productivity gains are nominal yeah I [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6048.24s)]
*  think that's a fair point because I'm forced to spend yeah again 750 billion dollars a year it [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6052.72s)]
*  doesn't all hang together yet yeah I agree there's going to be a bit of a gap there and and I am [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6059.2s)]
*  biased because I see startups which are always looking for the most resourceful way to do things [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6065.12s)]
*  and you're talking about large enterprises which are slow to adopt right so and I think we're both [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6069.28s)]
*  to be right here yeah you get around the innovators so I'm not by saying guys you need to be AI first [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6073.68s)]
*  from the outset which a startup can do because they can they can recruit people that for example [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6079.6s)]
*  with 80 90 same thing you must use these tools for example we are not allowed to have any [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6084.400000000001s)]
*  administrative staff everything is done by an agent or workflow but that's because we're a new [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6089.04s)]
*  company and we can make those decisions but somebody who is an established company I suspect that [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6094.320000000001s)]
*  these gains are nominal at best yet the spend is outrageous and it gets okay and when it catches [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6101.04s)]
*  up with you when you report I think the market is sort of like well I I think the first the you know [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6107.12s)]
*  the general statement might be made that perhaps the first AI mini bubble is bursting a bit and [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6112.719999999999s)]
*  particularly with respect to the accelerated expectations that public market investors had [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6119.679999999999s)]
*  for public market technology stocks that perhaps now is the time for a bit of a reckoning that [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6124.879999999999s)]
*  perhaps this isn't going to happen at the same margin level or the pace that folks had modeled [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6129.92s)]
*  and this is going to cause a bit of a setback I think pace is a very good point you're making [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6134.64s)]
*  I also think that with the GDP slowdown that we've seen report that just came out this week [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6138.72s)]
*  with a sub two percent US GDP growth we are seeing an economic slowdown underway there is going to be [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6143.28s)]
*  reduced spending there is going to be reduced conversion of enterprise customers to buy anything [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6148.24s)]
*  and so that is going to dramatically affect the market we're looking at five percent 30 year [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6153.84s)]
*  treasury rates which means that you are going to see multiple compression that's going to happen [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6157.6s)]
*  across the market for tech stocks so this could be the beginning of what I think might be a slow [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6161.92s)]
*  contraction one thing I just want to make sure I'm not a market guy just one thing to me I do have [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6166.56s)]
*  some information on the Dell stuff one thing to keep in mind is they had like a 30 run up or 20 [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6171.76s)]
*  run up at least since Nvidia's CEO praised them and like I guess all these meme stock people's just [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6177.6s)]
*  jumped in so I think it's just like a little ticky tacky correction back to the ticky tacky [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6186.08s)]
*  sax any final thoughts here on AI before we all leave to go to our you know Trump celebrations and [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6191.28s)]
*  or yeah maybe the market doesn't like the US becoming a banana republic there it is folks [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6hJh-OwoZw&t=6199.92s)]
