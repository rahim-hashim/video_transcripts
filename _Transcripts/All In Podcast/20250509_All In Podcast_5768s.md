*  we're laughing the whole time we did a little stage show and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  Tony Robbins came up we had Nico Ross Berg [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=165.52s)]

*  Then at the end of the show surprise guest none other than Sergey Brin who is punching a clock [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=178.74s)]
*  he's working like 70 hours a week over at a [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=185.3s)]
*  Alphabet and we'll talk about that today a bit. Did you have a favorite speaker? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=188.26s)]
*  Mr. Sultan of science the one and only David Friedberg [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=192.62s)]
*  Do you have a favorite speaker a moment on circuit Sergey Sergey did a great job. He was very casual very chill [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=196.36s)]
*  We had a great conversation. I think we should probably publish that as a standalone [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  I thought it was really good to drop them like a little midweek drop, but I will say [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  I gave him a shout out just because I think the work Antonio is doing is so important [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=211.72s)]
*  I am super impressed and I was really appreciative of him taking time to come hang out with us [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=216.56s)]
*  But obviously he's working with Elon on Doge, but he's also uncovering a lot of stuff in the government [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=222.60000000000002s)]
*  That it's really powerful to see someone actually go in do the digging and present it the way they are with the transparency [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  He is and he's not doing it for any angle [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=233.28s)]
*  There's no money. There's no benefit to him individually [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=235.72s)]
*  He's just probably net negative on the margins for really hard for him. And yeah, and it's just amazing based on you once experience [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  It's definitely net negative [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=245.32000000000002s)]
*  People maybe don't like having their grift canceled chamath Polly Hoppity or our chairman dictator [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=247.28s)]
*  You have a favorite moment with the speakers or a favorite speaker, you know highlight from the programming specifically [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=253.96s)]
*  I thought all five of them were amazing. I did I did think that Sergey did a really good job. I [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=260.26s)]
*  Like Nico Rosberg a lot. I did too [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=265.64s)]
*  For sure. I'm really excited to see what Francis does next after being the mayor of Miami [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=268.6s)]
*  Baby governor, we'll see what love and parties says I think they're all great Tony Robbins [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  I have to say his energy is very unique and when you're near it, I [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=279.46s)]
*  Didn't have many interactions with Tony up until that first time really [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=284.52s)]
*  I'd met him through Peter Goober a couple of times when I was part of the ownership team of the Warriors Peter's a co-owner [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=288.76s)]

*  But you know, he was kind of on his own tip [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=310.6s)]
*  But the audience loved him and we did a great like meditation exercise that everybody loved it was a lot of fun [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=312.38s)]

*  By the way, when you're live at the f1 [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=397.84000000000003s)]

*  It was raining to pull the table and put it inside the trophy house [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=413.76s)]
*  and then we had an incredible view of like the finish line and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=418.32s)]
*  There's Friedberg standing up me next to him. We had an incredible lineup Travis joined us [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=422.28s)]
*  You can see there Phil Helmuth haranguing poor Travis from uber [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=427.88s)]
*  This is always have to have his hand on a billionaire [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=433.55999999999995s)]
*  Feed of a billionaire he has a panic attack so and there's Helmuth for Helmuth my friend Timothy Chalamet [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=439.47999999999996s)]
*  Came by to say hi to me. And of course, he's being a constant [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  tackling him [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=452.52s)]
*  He's done such amazing work you can see how engaged he is in Phil Helmuth [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=464.2s)]
*  He's like who is that person? Why is he grabbing me? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=468.36s)]
*  But you know, then again Phil Helmuth is presenting him. And now here's a proper way. Can I say something? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=471.84s)]
*  Is that dealer is that dealer Larry Summers? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=476.48s)]
*  Was here he lost so much sponsorship and [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=485.64s)]
*  You know, there's so many deals that he now is working on moonlighting as a deal to continue the great debate [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=491.68s)]
*  But can I just point out here the proper way to embrace an a-list celebrity who you're friends with [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=498.32s)]
*  Timothy and I are just me just [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=509.04s)]
*  Timothy Chalamet, right? I will not say your friends [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=511.84s)]
*  We've met a couple of times like a handful of times because we're both Knicks fans and I'm friends with Ben Stiller [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=514.0s)]
*  Ben Stiller myself Timothy and my brother Josh went to the Pistons game [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=518.96s)]
*  You know versus the Knicks when we crush them and crush their soul [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=523.68s)]
*  So Timmy they came over just to say hi to me and his friend [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=526.32s)]
*  Yeah, Frankie and his other friend Cody block Frankie bones. He's got a great crew [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=529.24s)]
*  And you know, he came over to say hi to me and he was thanking me for the tickets [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=534.44s)]
*  I was able to get because it was hard to get tickets for that [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  Anyway for Helmuth don't tackle people at all in events. This is why your mouth banned you just [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  Then Helmuth was going around I don't know if you knew this [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=548.1600000000001s)]

*  Well, she likes that she understands it's broadcaster on broadcaster action. We like to mix it up. We know how to do ratings [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=721.6800000000001s)]
*  He's a ratings dude. Come on. All right, the fed held their rates steady again this week [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=728.0s)]
*  If you remember last year the fed cut 50 bips in september then 25 bips in november and december [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=733.9200000000001s)]
*  But so far in 2025 [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=739.44s)]
*  The fed has kept rates in a steady range 4.25 to 4.5 percent [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=741.6s)]
*  They said they want to wait and see they're in wait and see mode because they don't know what trump's doing with these tariffs [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=746.6400000000001s)]
*  And how that's going to impact the economy? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=751.9200000000001s)]
*  Here's the quote from the fed economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=754.0s)]
*  But they warned about potential stagflation risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=759.9200000000001s)]
*  Are their concerns and I talked about that last week. I'm hearing a lot of uh hand-wringing [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=765.7600000000001s)]
*  About layoffs coming soon [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=770.5799999999999s)]
*  So what do you think philippe about fed? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=773.22s)]
*  Not taking any action and what's your general take on the markets? You know, the the markets have seemed to [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=777.54s)]
*  recover largely from the trump independence day, um tariff announcement, but [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=783.86s)]
*  It's uh feels like pretty shaky out there a lot of m&a on hold a lot of hiring on hold [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=789.22s)]
*  What what are you seeing on the streets? Yeah [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=793.86s)]
*  Well, it hasn't been a boring year has it? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=796.42s)]
*  So I would say on the fed right a lot of people are saying oh, you know the fed should cut and [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=800.1s)]
*  This and that [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=805.6999999999999s)]
*  I actually think that there's also the scenario that what if the fed is cutting because things are not so great [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=806.9s)]
*  Maybe that's actually [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=813.86s)]
*  Not a good message and what if the fed is not cutting because actually the economy is really strong [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=815.46s)]
*  and so I think that the fed not cutting is actually not that bad of a message and [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=821.9399999999999s)]
*  I'm surprised just in general how bad sentiment is but how good the hard data is and [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=828.98s)]
*  We have this ratio at go to where we sort of divide hard news as a numerator [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=835.7800000000001s)]
*  And sentiment as a denominator [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=841.86s)]
*  And it's the first time where the news is so good and the sentiment is so bad [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=844.4200000000001s)]
*  And I don't know if the sentiment is bad [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=849.62s)]
*  because just the market went down a lot or [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=852.34s)]
*  For other reasons, but I actually think the economy is doing really well [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=855.38s)]
*  And we also learned two really important things. One is when the market did go down a lot [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=860.02s)]
*  The government did budge and said hey [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=865.0600000000001s)]
*  We need to step in here. And the second part is the fed did something that I thought was very clever [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=868.02s)]
*  They basically said we're not going to cut just to bail out the equity market [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=874.1s)]
*  But if the market's liquidity is no longer functioning emphasis on liquidity [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=877.86s)]
*  Then we'll step in to restore liquidity and I think those two things really brought the market back up and [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=883.86s)]
*  I think it's more a little bit the case of a [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=891.7s)]
*  Tariff correction or a tariff tantrum, but not a tariff crisis [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=894.9s)]
*  So you said there was a lot of good fundamental news. What would you put at the top of that list and you said [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=901.22s)]
*  there were things in terms of sentiment that were making people quite negative the the [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=906.98s)]
*  Economy [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=912.26s)]
*  As viewed by consumers is really shaking [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=913.38s)]
*  So what is the sentiment news that you are most tuned into and what are the hard data that you're most tuned into? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=916.0999999999999s)]
*  So on the on the hard data [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=923.2199999999999s)]
*  The part that's most surprising [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=925.78s)]
*  Is that consumers have very weak sentiment? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=928.18s)]
*  But in the meantime consumer spending is remarkably resilient [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=931.9399999999999s)]
*  And you can see this in a number of ways you can look at the visa and mastercard earnings [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=936.18s)]
*  but I also like just to listen to like little quotes little tidbits that you pick up in the transcripts of [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=941.4599999999999s)]
*  Of companies reporting earnings and stuff and people will say like even in the month of april [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=948.5s)]
*  Consumer spending is very strong and even in the last week when we adjust for the front loading [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=954.4799999999999s)]
*  Some people are pre-buying ahead of the tariffs even when we strip that out consumers really good [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=960.42s)]
*  So I think the part that to me is most surprising consumers great [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=966.5799999999999s)]
*  With respect to sentiment, it's really bad. But one thing that's funny is whenever the market goes down [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=970.98s)]
*  Sentiment is bad. And so I don't think sentiment is necessarily good [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=977.04s)]
*  Leading indicator. I almost think it's like a lagging indicator [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=981.06s)]
*  I bet you that now that the market's gone up we look at sentiment in a month from now [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=984.34s)]
*  And they'll be like, oh sentiment's getting better [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=989.14s)]
*  So I think that's what's going on [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=991.86s)]
*  Chamatha our friends at poly market are showing [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=994.02s)]
*  in [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=997.78s)]
*  june [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=998.9s)]
*  84 chance of no change july [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1000.0s)]
*  51 chance of no change and then september 48 chance of a cut and then powell [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1004.0s)]
*  Obviously trump's been mixing it up with him saying he's gonna fire him. He's not gonna fire him [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1010.48s)]
*  What's your take on the fed and what they should be doing here at this moment in time? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1014.64s)]
*  And then maybe you could respond to philip's [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1019.2s)]
*  Sort of insight there that I think was pretty good that there is a juxtaposition between what people are saying [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1021.68s)]
*  They're going to do consumers and how they feel about the economy then what they're actually doing [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1026.72s)]
*  I agree with philip's diagnosis that the fed will really be focused on liquidity. I agree with that [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1031.6000000000001s)]
*  In fact nick, I just sent you something on signal if you could just throw it up here, which is a really interesting view on subprime [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1039.76s)]
*  and what it shows you is [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1047.68s)]
*  The spread between where credit acceptance is versus capital wants and the point in bringing this up is that [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1050.64s)]
*  When you look back historically [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1057.1200000000001s)]
*  around these subprime lenders whenever [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1059.44s)]
*  These guys start to see price to books just start to escalate and get to pies. It tends to portend [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1062.0s)]
*  A liquidity crisis it tends to show that things are about to roll over [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1069.8400000000001s)]
*  and from that perspective [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1074.8s)]
*  I think that there are some blinking yellow lights that the fed needs to take seriously [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1077.6s)]
*  But then where I deviate from philip's perspective is I think that the fed is getting increasingly [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1083.76s)]
*  Political in how they want to react to the conditions on the ground. I'll give you [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1091.52s)]
*  Two perspectives. The first is if you actually read the press release [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1097.04s)]
*  Either the word wait [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1102.96s)]
*  Waiting or some synonym of that word was littered in there 22 times [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1104.96s)]
*  It just seemed like an incredible amount of verbal gymnastics [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1109.76s)]
*  To try to justify why they weren't cutting [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1114.48s)]
*  And if I had to just take that at its face value [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1118.4s)]
*  I would at least put some percentage of probability that you have to assign to this case where powell [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1122.64s)]
*  views that if this lever [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1129.76s)]
*  Is the only thing that he has going into the midterms [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1132.8s)]
*  It's almost as if he's holding it back [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1137.68s)]
*  Because I think that if you look at some of these leading indicators [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1140.64s)]
*  Particularly on the liquidity side. I agree with philip about how important that specific metric is [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1144.22s)]
*  I don't believe in the fed put we've talked about this [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1150.08s)]
*  But I think the liquidity measures are starting to blink yellow [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1152.64s)]
*  And I think that if the fed really wanted to get ahead of it [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1156.24s)]
*  They could cut but the political overlay is cutting helps trump and I think there's this tension between these two people [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1159.12s)]
*  And I think that the fed is saying we're not going to cut so your position is or what you're hypothesizing here [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1165.9199999999998s)]
*  Is that the fed is saying hey, we have to wait for trump to clean up the tariff stuff the trade war stuff [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1172.0s)]
*  And that that's a political act by powell in retaliation for trump saying he wanted to fire him. Is that what you're insinuating? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1179.12s)]
*  No, no, no, it's not what i'm insinuating what i'm saying very directly is that the fed is acting in [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1187.22s)]
*  in a manner that is [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1194.1000000000001s)]
*  As much politically motivated as financially metric motivated because the financial metrics some of the most critical leading indicators [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1195.7s)]
*  Particularly around liquidity and the credit health of the american consumer [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1203.76s)]
*  Are blinking yellow. So right now they are choosing to ignore [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1209.14s)]
*  These historically useful leading indicators and the only reason that I can come up with to ignore it are political reasons [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1213.72s)]
*  so [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1221.16s)]
*  Freeberg do you think there's a political beef going on here between the two parties and what do you think about subprime? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1222.12s)]
*  Uh, and maybe this being a lead indicator that [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1229.24s)]
*  Maybe it's time for a cut. Maybe we're going to see people miss mortgage payments car loans, etc [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1232.76s)]
*  I was just looking at the mortgage delinquency rates. They're pretty flat right now [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1237.88s)]
*  and that's I think because so many people did refinance when rates were low and there's a tremendous amount of [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1244.5200000000002s)]
*  mortgage balance with a with a low rate outstanding [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1250.2s)]
*  But remember, I think the fed has a whole bunch of [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1254.1200000000001s)]
*  Data that they're still going to need to wait on the cpi data [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1257.5600000000002s)]
*  For march was 2.4 percent their target is 2 percent [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1262.6000000000001s)]
*  The next cpi report comes out I think next tuesday and so that's going to be an important indicator [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1267.16s)]
*  But I do think one other data point that is now going to be part of the calculus [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1272.8400000000001s)]
*  Is what do these trade deals look like? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1278.3600000000001s)]
*  So this morning it was announced that there's a trade deal with the uk [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1281.0800000000002s)]
*  and in that trade deal [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1287.32s)]
*  there are lots of provisions that relate to parity and what [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1289.96s)]
*  Is expected to provide better market access for american businesses into the uk? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1294.84s)]
*  But there's also a really important piece of data there, which is that there is a 10 tariff rate for imports from the uk into the us [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1300.28s)]
*  So this is the first time we're seeing a trade deal that actually gets announced and finalized [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1308.04s)]
*  Through this whole tariff trade negotiation process that's been underway now for several weeks with all the hoopla and all the drama [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1313.24s)]
*  Attached to it [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1319.8799999999999s)]
*  And what we're seeing is that for one of our friendliest allies [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1321.3999999999999s)]
*  For one of our best trade partners, we are keeping in place a 10 tariff rate [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1324.6s)]
*  So if that holds with other trade deals and that becomes kind of a standard across the board as they get more of these trade deals [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1330.12s)]
*  Done perhaps with countries that are less friendly with more onerous with less regulatory parity in the trade relationship between the us and that country [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1336.84s)]
*  Maybe there's higher tariff rates. What that means ultimately [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1345.24s)]
*  Is that there is now maybe a pretty sizable long-term revenue stream for the federal government that didn't exist before [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1349.08s)]
*  Which means that there's room to cut taxes [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1355.6399999999999s)]
*  Which means that this is all going to be part of the calculus of the fed's decision [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1358.9199999999998s)]
*  On whether or not and why they would need to cut rates because this is going to drive inflation. It's going to drive gbp growth [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1363.7199999999998s)]
*  It's going to drive employment [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1371.0s)]
*  And so I think that there is a pretty dynamic situation at play right now. It's not just that there's [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1372.84s)]
*  a static tax revenue base and a static federal spending model [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1378.36s)]
*  And then cpi and employment data that is going to follow them [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1383.4799999999998s)]
*  Do you think powell thinks that this trump thing is going to work? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1386.6s)]
*  So he's holding bullets in the chamber because he's worried about inflation. I think they're going to wait for data [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1389.7199999999998s)]
*  I would agree with that. Yeah, dave in fact, uh a couple things. I was wondering your opinion on is one [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1394.76s)]
*  I was with this retailer [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1403.08s)]
*  Gigantic retailer in the u.s [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1406.04s)]
*  And there's this sort of false narrative that when you have tariffs like 100 percent of tariffs are going to get passed through in [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1408.12s)]
*  Pricing and therefore tariff is like a tax right that retailer told us that they think only about 50 percent [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1414.1s)]
*  Of the tariff gets passed in pricing. So I I sort of agree with you. There is going to be a net net [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1421.72s)]
*  Positive and that retailers have way to work things around and stuff like that [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1428.82s)]
*  I would also say today post this announcement the market's very strong [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1433.8799999999999s)]
*  and initially I was a little bit surprised because [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1438.76s)]
*  We're taxing 10 percent [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1442.28s)]
*  Not only the most friendly country but one where we actually have a surplus [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1444.6799999999998s)]
*  So it's like if it's 10 percent when we have a surplus [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1450.12s)]
*  What is it when we have a deficit? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1453.6399999999999s)]
*  but on the other hand the market is speaking as we speak and I also think that [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1455.6399999999999s)]
*  Uh, there were a lot of announcements that seem to make it like hey, we're gonna make a deal with china [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1461.08s)]
*  We want china to do well, but we need to do well, too [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1467.32s)]
*  It seems to me that at some point [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1470.76s)]
*  Maybe there'll be a bit more of a win-win versus such a acrimonious and maybe that's why [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1472.92s)]
*  The market's reacting a little bit more positively by the way that trade deal. We also eliminated the two percent [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1478.2s)]
*  Sir tax on big tech companies and then [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1484.44s)]
*  howard just said today [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1487.56s)]
*  that [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1489.96s)]
*  They're gonna announce a 10 billion dollar order from boeing [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1490.9199999999998s)]
*  On top of that as well [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1494.52s)]
*  So these are gonna drive gdp they're gonna drive employment. It's really hard to cut rates into a market [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1497.08s)]
*  Where there is not yet priced in or not yet well understood but an expectation [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1503.3999999999999s)]
*  Of a driver for gdp driver for employment [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1508.52s)]
*  And potentially an impact on inflation. It's really hard to go into that sort of an environment cut [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1512.04s)]
*  I mean if we're in a sustained period of four to five percent rates [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1516.36s)]
*  I mean we should talk about that at some point but [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1520.44s)]
*  There's huge implications to the economy if this thing stays where it is huge [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1522.84s)]
*  philippe are you in the camp of 4d chess with these tariffs in these negotiations or [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1527.8799999999999s)]
*  You know throw some stuff against the wall react to it in real time [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1534.44s)]
*  You know, he's shaking the snow globe. It's it's chaos, etc [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1538.28s)]
*  Where do you sit between those two opinions? We've heard on this podcast over and over [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1541.72s)]
*  You know when you ask a tech investor for like his opinion on macro. Yeah [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1546.28s)]
*  This is the beginning of the end, right? I think i've like predicted [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1551.48s)]
*  I think i've like predicted like [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1555.56s)]
*  Seven of the last three recessions, you know [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1557.72s)]
*  My track record is pretty weak. Well, let me ask a different then question. How is this impacting? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1561.3999999999999s)]
*  the tech market [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1566.52s)]
*  Private companies that are thinking about going public m&a we saw door dash by two companies this week [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1568.2s)]
*  We've seen a bunch of companies file to go public. We've seen them pausing [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1573.96s)]
*  does this kind of [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1578.0400000000002s)]
*  Uncertainty which it seems like is causing the disconnect, right? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1579.94s)]
*  You you explain this disconnect how people feel about the economy and then their behavior [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1583.72s)]
*  Is that disconnect caused by the sort of communication that chamath and I and other folks were saying hey needs to be improved here [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1588.1200000000001s)]
*  And it seems to be with this uk [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1594.2s)]
*  If this had been the process from the start we were like, hey, we're going to do one of these a week for 50 weeks [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1596.2800000000002s)]
*  And you're going to get this good news each week as we sort this out [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1601.48s)]
*  That seems to me like something that would build confidence as opposed to hey [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1605.3999999999999s)]
*  Everybody's going to go back and forth you say 50 we're going to go to 150 tit for tat [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1608.9199999999998s)]
*  So maybe talk about the impact this has for founders startups executive teams [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1612.9199999999998s)]
*  I think for tech guys by and large, you know, a lot of the tech is in services. So that's out of the picture for now [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1618.12s)]
*  But there's obviously going to be a lot of tariffs for semis and then for the assembling of the motherboards [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1626.6000000000001s)]
*  Into computers. So those are the two key areas [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1632.7600000000002s)]
*  And one of the difficulty is we have these sort of base tariffs, but we also have these sector tariffs and we've had sector tariffs [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1635.64s)]
*  In cars 25 percent. There's rumor to be sector tariffs in pharma that could come out next week and there's also been [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1643.0800000000002s)]
*  Potential sector tariffs, you know in semis [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1651.72s)]
*  So it's been pretty disruptive [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1655.1s)]
*  And I don't really know [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1658.22s)]
*  How to think about it and I think nobody knew which is why the market just took a 25 percent peak to trough down [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1660.06s)]
*  and then [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1667.02s)]
*  After that we learned well, the government is actually smarter [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1668.3799999999999s)]
*  They're gonna one of the things that I love to see is all these executives that get to come to [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1671.5s)]
*  Also plead their case in washington and maybe that was never the case [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1676.3799999999999s)]
*  You know a few months ago and there seems to at least be a feed a feedback loop [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1679.6599999999999s)]
*  Okay, we do something we see what breaks we listen we readjust and stuff like that [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1684.7s)]
*  but to be honest, I don't really know how it's going to play out and [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1689.82s)]
*  I sort of was very conservative for a period of time just waiting [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1694.94s)]
*  and then to me [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1698.86s)]
*  What happened last week with microsoft saying that like ai had really picked up [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1700.86s)]
*  That was like a really big deal and I almost like [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1706.3s)]
*  Coined it in my own mind like tokens greater greater than tariffs [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1709.5s)]
*  And I think like one of the reason why the market's moving up just hold on. Hold on just explain that just a little [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1714.06s)]
*  What do you mean by tariffs? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1719.26s)]
*  Tokens, I don't know. I put the greater greater sign, you know tokens are much greater than tariffs tokens [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1721.02s)]
*  You mean ai tokens ai tokens. Yeah. Yeah, so I I sort of view tokens unite. I don't really understand the [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1726.06s)]
*  As well as day for sure, you know all the ai [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1733.42s)]
*  Models and stuff like that, but I sort of view tokens to an ai model [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1736.94s)]
*  It's like fuel to a car or electricity to a computer, right? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1740.78s)]
*  And microsoft said that in their q1 they processed 100 trillion tokens [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1744.86s)]
*  50 trillion alone in march [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1750.3799999999999s)]
*  And so the tokens are really going basically vertical which is probably because of these reasoning engines which are much more sophisticated [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1752.46s)]
*  And require more compute power [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1760.46s)]
*  And I think the market it didn't [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1762.62s)]
*  To to it's a bit unfair for trump, but the market did not just go down because of tariffs [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1764.7s)]
*  If you remember it went down because people freaked out were in an ai bubble ai is not really working [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1770.78s)]
*  What's the roi on ai that was maybe? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1775.6599999999999s)]
*  I don't know half a third to a half of the problem [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1779.26s)]
*  and I think what microsoft said is like [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1782.78s)]
*  CapEx is going up and everybody has a gigantic shortage of chips right now [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1785.98s)]
*  That I know for sure from all of our private companies public companies there's a shortage of chip a shortage of compute power [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1790.6200000000001s)]
*  And so I think that's also maybe why the market's going up. And so for me it was sort of a way [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1797.58s)]
*  Emotionally, I got so drained with the tariffs and thinking about tariffs and having to think about something. I don't really understand [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1802.84s)]
*  And I feel now there's a chance [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1809.98s)]
*  When you look at the next year or two at some point tariffs goes away trump makes this big deal with [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1812.14s)]
*  Uh deregulation the tax breaks sort of cancel out the tariffs we move on and what are we left with? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1817.74s)]
*  We're left with tokens [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1824.22s)]
*  And I think the world of tokens for me. I've been doing this for 35 years [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1825.8200000000002s)]
*  It's maybe the most exciting [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1830.0600000000002s)]
*  Trend and thing that i've seen and all these people that say oh, this is the end of american exceptionalism [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1832.14s)]
*  I almost wanted to say no you guys are wrong [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1838.0600000000002s)]
*  This is the beginning of american exceptionalism because we've got wall street [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1840.22s)]
*  We've got silicon valley and we still got a pretty good government that at least tries to get stuff done [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1843.98s)]
*  so [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1850.8600000000001s)]
*  i'm pretty [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1851.66s)]
*  Excited by that. I've been talking [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1853.18s)]
*  With my management team a lot about ai first principles and we're actually doing an off site in two weeks on this [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1856.46s)]
*  Because i've been following a lot of what the other ceos have been doing and hearing stories [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1864.14s)]
*  We had a great conversation with serga. He gave us two anecdotes of how [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1868.78s)]
*  He personally has used some of these tools to make management decisions and his observation was managers are the first to go [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1872.62s)]
*  And if you zoom out from that statement and you zoom out from the comments you're making philip [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1880.3799999999999s)]
*  There's I would say like a once in a generational opportunity [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1886.3799999999999s)]
*  to select companies [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1891.4199999999998s)]
*  That are going to accelerate growth because of the leverage they're going to create by adoption of these tools not tech companies [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1893.98s)]
*  In the traditional sense but across the entire economy [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1902.1399999999999s)]
*  And some of what we're seeing right now [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1905.8999999999999s)]
*  In the reformation of venture capitalists and i know you're going to talk a little bit about co2 [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1908.62s)]
*  Here in a bit, but so much of the thesis is around traditional businesses being reinvented using ai [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1915.1799999999998s)]
*  And as a result, it's not just the few tech companies that are providing the fuel [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1922.62s)]
*  But there are these fires that are going to take off in all these different markets that [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1927.98s)]
*  We could sit and spend probably hours kind of, you know, extrapolating and theorizing on [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1932.1399999999999s)]
*  That creates a real opportunity for incredible market value creation and traditionally [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1937.58s)]
*  It's like the market grows and the differentiation among the competitors is minima minimized once the market has matured [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1941.58s)]
*  But for the first time ever every mature market can be completely disrupted. And so so if you're smart about selecting management teams and selecting companies [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1947.26s)]
*  It seems to be an incredible opportunity to realize investment returns [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1955.5s)]
*  Okay, even in a mature equity market, let's move on to our next topic, which is obviously super related [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1958.8600000000001s)]
*  Google was down eight percent on wednesday [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1963.5s)]
*  after some bad search data came out because the justice department as everybody probably knows is doing this antitrust lawsuit with google [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1965.8200000000002s)]
*  And the key part of that lawsuit is [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1974.0600000000002s)]
*  Google paying apple 20 billion a year to be the default search engine on iphones [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1976.8600000000001s)]
*  Obviously, we all know iphones have elite customers. Those are very [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1981.3400000000001s)]
*  Precious searches from people with a lot of money because iphones are expensive [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1985.1000000000001s)]
*  Anyway eddie q who's been with apple for 35 years. He said quote for the first time ever last month [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1988.94s)]
*  Our search volume actually went down [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1995.58s)]
*  Quote that has never happened in 20 years if you ask what's happening. It's because people are using chat gpt [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=1998.38s)]
*  They're using perplexity. I use it at times [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2004.3s)]
*  He believes that ai search is going to replace classic search like google quote again [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2007.42s)]
*  There's enough money now enough large players that I don't see how it doesn't happen [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2012.38s)]
*  Bloomberg reported on q's comments at 11 a.m [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2016.92s)]
*  An hour later google was down a hundred billion dollars in market cap. It bounced back a little bit today when we're taping this on [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2019.58s)]
*  Thursday [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2026.68s)]
*  Here's the statement from google [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2027.82s)]
*  responding to q's [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2030.38s)]
*  Comments we continue to see overall query growth in search that includes an increase in total queries coming from apple's devices and platforms freeburg [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2031.82s)]
*  Is it time for google to panic little shareholders to panic? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2039.66s)]
*  We talked last week about making bold decisions about [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2044.6200000000001s)]
*  What is the default and how might google get out of this classic innovators dilemma? What do you think? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2048.2200000000003s)]
*  We keep coming back to a search dead [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2054.7000000000003s)]
*  conversation everyone knows that the search click repeat paradigm is over [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2058.36s)]
*  and there's a new model in what I would [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2064.2200000000003s)]
*  Zoom out a little bit and say is kind of the difference in human computer interaction for knowledge information [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2067.18s)]
*  and services [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2074.22s)]
*  It may not be that I type something into a search box [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2076.62s)]
*  It may be that i'm having a chat that chat may happen in a chat window. It may happen [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2079.4199999999996s)]
*  Via voice it may happen on a screen. It may happen in an earpod [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2085.1s)]
*  We don't yet know where the consumer is going to go with this, but there's a lot of paradigm shifts underway [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2089.74s)]
*  I will say google has models that are if not the best competitive [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2096.3799999999997s)]
*  So the underlying models the underlying technology exists [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2102.14s)]
*  They are certainly aware of the shift in the paradigm [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2105.8199999999997s)]
*  And so the transition for google doesn't need to happen overnight to a chat interface that looks like chat gbt [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2110.3799999999997s)]
*  It may be a standalone app. They have a standalone app as chamath has pointed out in the past [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2118.22s)]
*  They don't do a great job promoting it [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2122.06s)]
*  They don't do a great job integrating the chat interface into search or replacing search of the chat interface because remember search ad revenue today [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2123.58s)]
*  is 200 billion dollars [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2132.54s)]
*  and the cost to serve an ai query is [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2134.54s)]
*  Order of magnitude higher than the cost to serve a search query [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2137.98s)]
*  So flipping the search interface over to a chat interface overnight doesn't make sense and they don't need to they have the users [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2141.5s)]
*  They have the models they already have the product [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2147.98s)]
*  So it's going to be a slow kind of process of finding the optimal course [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2150.38s)]
*  For them to make the transition would be my guess on what they're doing [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2155.42s)]
*  It's a question of at what point do you change the default on google? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2158.86s)]
*  Do you make it a slow one box? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2163.34s)]
*  Which is that answer section at the top of the search page and you slowly get people used to that [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2165.66s)]
*  And you lead them over to the chat interface or do you do it all at once or do you tell people hey go use the app? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2170.78s)]
*  Instead of the search box [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2175.98s)]
*  So there's a lot that I think they're going to discover and if anything, this is an organization [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2177.42s)]
*  That is used to doing testing and then making incremental changes and then making big changes once they're you know [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2182.2200000000003s)]
*  Kind of tested and proven off. I'm pretty positive on [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2187.1800000000003s)]
*  Their ability to respond to the shift if there is one underway, I guess two important data points to mouth [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2190.3s)]
*  I'd like you to respond to [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2195.02s)]
*  Search is only like 56 percent of google's revenue right now people forget they have cloud so they have diversified [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2196.7000000000003s)]
*  It's not a one revenue stream company anymore [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2202.86s)]
*  And then also these google search results at the top of the page they're dropping precipitously [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2205.66s)]
*  The number of clicks below it so different studies 15 to 35 percent of the clicks below the box [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2211.4199999999996s)]
*  Are not getting you know are dropping so this is significant [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2217.8199999999997s)]
*  But it seems manageable. Where do you stand on it right now time to panic or [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2222.7s)]
*  As freeberg was saying before hey, maybe it's a great opportunity for google to add yet another product line yet [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2227.5s)]
*  Another revenue stream. They definitely have [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2233.98s)]
*  the best models in many domains [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2237.5800000000004s)]
*  I would say that [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2241.7400000000002s)]
*  The code gen models from anthropoc are really good, but [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2243.34s)]
*  In many other domains including general [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2246.2200000000003s)]
*  Information and chat I think gemini is exceptional. So what is the problem? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2248.86s)]
*  The problem is that they were effectively at 99 share [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2253.34s)]
*  and now [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2257.42s)]
*  We were always just waiting for that shoe to drop which is where they started to go from 99 to something less than 99 [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2258.86s)]
*  And the point is now that it has happened [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2266.46s)]
*  It is very easy [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2269.26s)]
*  for anybody to build a model that [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2271.26s)]
*  precisely [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2274.04s)]
*  Calculates the economic value of every single basis point of share shift that happens [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2275.48s)]
*  And what you saw was an initiation of that process this week [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2281.5s)]
*  So what do you do? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2286.1400000000003s)]
*  The problem is that this is not google's problem. This is a consumer choice issue and they have chosen something different [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2288.3799999999997s)]
*  And whether we like it or not and whether they like it or not [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2296.22s)]
*  The reality is that chat gpt is running away with it [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2299.5s)]
*  And if you look at the growth [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2303.98s)]
*  and the share [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2306.8599999999997s)]
*  That open ai is seeing [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2308.46s)]
*  It's quite an incredible thing [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2311.8199999999997s)]
*  So what does one do? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2314.22s)]
*  I think that instead of waiting for data [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2316.62s)]
*  I think that you have to assume that you're going to go from 99 [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2319.58s)]
*  percent share [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2323.8199999999997s)]
*  To 75 in the next two years as an example, and you need to start asking yourself what will go wrong? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2325.18s)]
*  And if you can ask yourself that question honestly and red team that [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2333.2599999999998s)]
*  Then I think the conclusion you get to is you need to start very aggressively integrating gemini [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2337.74s)]
*  as the front-facing window [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2343.66s)]
*  to google inc [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2346.22s)]
*  But again, as I sort of said last week [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2348.06s)]
*  that requires [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2350.7s)]
*  A combination of taste and courage. Otherwise, what will happen is if you're waiting for the data [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2352.3799999999997s)]
*  You're just going to get caught off guard [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2358.4599999999996s)]
*  Because apple will do things and then make a press release [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2360.7799999999997s)]
*  Months after the fact open ai will announce a press release [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2364.06s)]
*  Facebook will do something and what that does is it destroys the morale of the company of the brilliant product managers of which [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2367.66s)]
*  There are many and the brilliant engineers of which there are many inside of google if you're sitting around waiting to react [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2374.3s)]
*  To some sandwich served up by your competitors [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2380.2200000000003s)]
*  That is a terrible approach [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2383.7400000000002s)]
*  Philippe, what are your thoughts here on google? You obviously participate in public markets. Is it a buy right now? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2386.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to give investment advice, but do you think the company has the talent? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2392.3s)]
*  the temperament to make these hard decisions and to [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2397.5s)]
*  Turn this around or avoid the iceberg if the iceberg being chat gpt and people getting answers instead of links [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2401.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, I think you guys have summarized the situation pretty well [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2409.02s)]
*  I would just add just a couple small things one is the [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2412.46s)]
*  market cap of google is like 1.8 trillion and that of [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2416.3799999999997s)]
*  Chat gpt is let's say 300. So google is worth six [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2420.3799999999997s)]
*  Chat gpt and is that the correct ratio into the future or not? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2424.62s)]
*  The second one is I was around sadly [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2429.18s)]
*  In the times of the yellow pages and I remember when the yellow pages the way you go somewhere to bounce [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2432.7799999999997s)]
*  And go somewhere else and basically these yellow links got replaced by the blue link [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2439.58s)]
*  And the yellow page companies went away now part of the reason they went away is they were very levered [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2444.7s)]
*  google has no leverage sits on a lot of cash and [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2449.58s)]
*  Imagine what someone like elon would do if he had to re-engineer google [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2453.1s)]
*  I think they have [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2458.3s)]
*  You know, it's it's a much larger company. Let's say than twitter [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2459.9s)]
*  So like the part that i'm wondering about i haven't made an opinion on google is like hey, is this the next ibm? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2463.82s)]
*  You're going to stick around for really really long time [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2470.86s)]
*  But you're just not going to be like a company growing as fast as you used to and maybe there'll be little growth [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2473.6600000000003s)]
*  And you just sort of struggle ahead or can they completely re-engineer their business and they do have two great businesses [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2480.06s)]
*  Waymo and youtube and really cloud and all the cloud apps [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2487.5s)]
*  So they have three great businesses and then they have this one search business [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2491.8199999999997s)]
*  Like you said, maybe it's 60 percent of the revenue. It's probably 85 percent of the profits because it's just so profitable [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2495.74s)]
*  No, I would say 110 percent of the profits 110 right? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2503.18s)]
*  So you're right because some of these others lose money [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2507.2599999999998s)]
*  That's actually a good point. So [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2510.54s)]
*  Um, if you put that together, it's just a classic innovators the lamb nine imagine that they create a gemini app [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2512.54s)]
*  And we start downloading the gemini app. I would love to be the fly on the wall [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2519.2599999999998s)]
*  Between the head of the gemini app and then the head of like the search box [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2523.74s)]
*  And they're both fighting because one guy is stealing the business from the other [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2528.3s)]
*  and stuff like that [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2532.3s)]
*  Personally me I found that these stocks they're like a little bit too complicated for me [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2533.98s)]
*  And I think that sometimes in life you just got to say hey, this is just tricky [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2539.1s)]
*  There's like a lot of forces at work [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2543.18s)]
*  But the one thing stepping out that I would think about is there was this concept of the max seven [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2545.18s)]
*  And for the last two or three years everybody is like, oh you just need to own the max seven [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2551.3399999999997s)]
*  It's really easy. I can do it on my own [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2556.54s)]
*  And I think what ai is showing is that at a time of great change and like you guys said on the show a couple of you [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2559.02s)]
*  ai is sort of [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2565.8199999999997s)]
*  Imitating so many fast changes to me [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2567.72s)]
*  It's a little bit like the end of the max seven and what we should do is almost think like [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2571.0s)]
*  Hey, what is the next remember when the max seven used to be fang and then fang plus plus and nobody talks about fang anymore [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2576.2s)]
*  And now I don't know like with the max seven the sexy six or the fabulous five [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2583.56s)]
*  There's going to be a new index that comes up and I think we should think about like who's going to be on the new index [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2589.3999999999996s)]
*  Which private companies which public companies? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2594.92s)]
*  And I think google for sure has some struggles, but it's got a lot of advantages and a lot of cash [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2598.76s)]
*  You know to your to your to your point though to just to add one thing, which I I love this framing [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2604.84s)]
*  Here's another data point [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2610.12s)]
*  if you [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2612.2000000000003s)]
*  Were going to make the case that we need to [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2613.48s)]
*  Go into harvest mode [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2617.08s)]
*  Right and say we don't know the rate of change [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2619.4s)]
*  of [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2622.92s)]
*  The search business so let's just have as much money on hand so that we have as much optionality. That's a very reasonable and fair strategy [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2623.8s)]
*  You would probably not spend 75 billion dollars a year of capex on making these models [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2632.1200000000003s)]
*  The opposite is also true if you're going to drain your cash at a rate of change [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2638.44s)]
*  That's greater than it needs to be to the tune of an extra 75 billion dollars a year [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2643.6400000000003s)]
*  There's probably a case to be made. Well, if we've made the cake, let's sell the cake [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2649.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, we've made the dog food. Let's have the dogs eat the dog food [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2654.1200000000003s)]
*  It's the in the middle strategy of both spending the money but then stage gating the product [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2657.6400000000003s)]
*  That is the worst outcome in my opinion. I think they're right to invest. I find these companies that decide to harvest [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2662.52s)]
*  You know the cash cow [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2670.1200000000003s)]
*  And buy all their shares back, you know, it never really works [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2672.04s)]
*  I think that the only chance that google has to create an amazing company is you got to take some risks at the end of the day [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2675.88s)]
*  The man in the arena he who takes the risk usually gets the spoil [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2682.92s)]
*  And they've got to invest in the future. It'll be interesting to see if their shareholders, you know agree with that or not [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2687.32s)]
*  What do you do jay kal? What do you think? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2693.72s)]
*  Great question. You guys teed it up perfectly [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2696.2s)]
*  I think they're going to cut a large number of employees get people to return back to office [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2698.44s)]
*  And take this a little more seriously on a corporate level because you got that sense from sergue who's in the office every day [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2704.36s)]
*  And I use gemini and I have a sort of ai first company where everybody's required to do their work on ai [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2709.8s)]
*  Two or three different claude gemini grok, etc [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2716.92s)]
*  And what i've been noticing inside these products is they're very deeply integrated. I got surprised just the other day [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2720.04s)]
*  I was asking it about a travel question and it referenced my g calendar [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2726.2000000000003s)]
*  I didn't know they could do that then [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2731.32s)]
*  obviously you can use [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2734.04s)]
*  Chat you can use gemini inside of google doxnet [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2736.2799999999997s)]
*  They have four or five products right now that are one or two billion [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2739.72s)]
*  Users per month obviously chrome might get spun out, but you have youtube you have google docs you have android [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2743.96s)]
*  They have such a data advantage and such a deep integration into people's lives because they use three or four services [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2749.96s)]
*  I use youtube tv. I use youtube [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2756.04s)]
*  And have a subscription to that youtube music [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2758.68s)]
*  They have such integration. I think google's going to figure this out and if they cut their [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2761.56s)]
*  Team size down earnings are going to go massively up and they're spending 75 [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2765.9599999999996s)]
*  Billion dollars on infrastructure. I think it's going to be [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2773.08s)]
*  Would you integrate these models more aggressively into in front of the consumer or would you is this the rate that makes the most sense? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2776.4399999999996s)]
*  In your mind, I think you mentioned like maybe go all in on certain other services [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2782.2799999999997s)]
*  I think youtube search is the place to go all in [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2787.3999999999996s)]
*  Right now when you do a youtube search, it just gives you 10 links, right? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2790.2s)]
*  Just give you that rolling bang [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2792.76s)]
*  You should be able to ask a question to youtube and you should be able to ask questions to your calendar [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2793.88s)]
*  You should be able to say who have I met with over the last 10 years? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2798.1200000000003s)]
*  Who i'm no longer in touch with and what are they up to and it should do a gemini search inside? [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2801.8s)]
*  Of google calendar. It's very light right now. And then if you did that on youtube [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2807.0s)]
*  Hey, tell me everybody's opinion on co2 and their strategy over the years and how it's changed and you ask that on youtube [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2810.28s)]
*  With all their transcripts they could make a super cut of all of that. This would train people [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2816.92s)]
*  You know at the point of pain in a very deep way without sacrificing google search queries [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2822.2s)]
*  You know too aggressively so there's [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2828.7599999999998s)]
*  Youtube such a secret weapon. I hear you I would just remind [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2831.24s)]
*  the google management team [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2835.3199999999997s)]
*  That very very very smart people like philip and others who control trillions of dollars [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2837.4s)]
*  I wish [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2843.7999999999997s)]
*  Well collectively are not [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2845.08s)]
*  making the decisions about today but are [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2847.64s)]
*  Taking the trail of breadcrumbs of what they see today and guesstimating what 18 to 24 months in the future looks like [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2850.8399999999997s)]
*  and all i'm encouraging them to do is [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2857.48s)]
*  I think that that data point from eddie [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2860.44s)]
*  Is the beginning of a stream of such data points and I just encourage them to inoculate them from the morale hit that will come [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2864.7599999999998s)]
*  If they don't have an explicit aggressive strategy [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2873.72s)]
*  And instead if they become reactive to external data [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2877.48s)]
*  It's really demoralizing [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2882.36s)]
*  But what if what if they're actually tracking the data? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2884.44s)]
*  and [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2888.92s)]
*  They're seeing their own sense of [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2889.96s)]
*  search queries [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2893.1600000000003s)]
*  Driving clicks and then driving positive response to the ai-driven one box results that they show at the top [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2895.0s)]
*  Oh, I think that's exactly what they're seeing but then they're just making that they're making the requisite [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2901.32s)]
*  Balancing decisions, right? No. No, what i'm saying is that's absolutely what they're seeing that the demonstrated strategy is emblematic of exactly that [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2906.2s)]
*  It's the rationalization [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2913.96s)]
*  My point is there's something that you can't rationalize because you don't know until it's presented to you [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2915.72s)]
*  Which is what is the other company doing? They don't have spies inside of open ai. They don't know what the open ai product strategy looks like [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2920.36s)]
*  They only hear secondhand what the open ai growth looks like and all i'm saying is it's a bit of a sort of damocles [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2928.44s)]
*  At some point the sword drops. You're not in control of it [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2935.1s)]
*  And once you start to see a trend [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2938.54s)]
*  That's the rationalization that I think puts companies in a very difficult and tricky strategic situation [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2942.46s)]
*  It takes a lot of courage to say oh my god [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2948.94s)]
*  Like it's like but buffett said this like buffett has this very famous thing of just putting his ceos on the spot and saying [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2951.66s)]
*  Stop telling me all these things that can go right. Let's go paint the death case [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2958.06s)]
*  What can absolutely go wrong and red team need the solution and then justify for me why you haven't done it and all i'm saying is [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2961.34s)]
*  If you start to think about like for example, you saw open ai today fiji simo. She's leaving [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2968.46s)]
*  Instacart, right? She's going to go and be the ceo of apps inside of open ai you're seeing [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2973.1800000000003s)]
*  A level of talent concentrate that I have not seen since I was at facebook [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2978.6200000000003s)]
*  There was nobody we couldn't get when we thought we were building a model that was totally orthogonal to google [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2983.1800000000003s)]
*  Now it did not mean that google diminished in any way, but it creates a different use case [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2989.5s)]
*  In that example though, the social use case was very much [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2995.02s)]
*  non-cannibalistic to the blue links [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=2999.48s)]
*  and to your point david if it turns out that [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3002.8599999999997s)]
*  Question asking [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3006.06s)]
*  Is not cannibalistic to search google will be fine [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3008.06s)]
*  All i'm encouraging them to do is play the scenario where it is cannibalistic and figure out what to do. I think [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3011.02s)]
*  There's a chance that we're underestimating the power of google's ad network right now [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3017.1s)]
*  It's quite possible that knowing your queries in gemini knowing what you're doing in calendar knowing what you're watching on youtube could lead to a stream [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3022.14s)]
*  Of more target ads that do better and are more valuable [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3029.42s)]
*  And so we've been seeing a number of companies startups, you know in the early stages and year one startups [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3033.02s)]
*  That are figuring out how to use your queries [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3038.62s)]
*  And what you're doing in ai to present to you search results [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3041.5s)]
*  So imagine you're doing a gemini search to moth and or for leave and on the side of it [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3045.5s)]
*  It's giving you a rolling list of ads or offers that you might be more interested in [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3049.1s)]
*  That could be a better advertising product than even search itself rebert your thoughts. Well, let me ask [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3054.46s)]
*  All three of you a question which is since chat gpt's come out and gemini and other tools like it [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3061.5s)]
*  Do you find that you're doing? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3068.2200000000003s)]
*  Generally more stuff or less stuff [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3070.3799999999997s)]
*  I find that I am using [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3074.2999999999997s)]
*  Search a lot less [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3077.58s)]
*  I ask but the aggregate is your aggregate like usage of the internet to do things for yourself for work [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3079.1s)]
*  Kind of are you getting more? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3086.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, i've learned how to ask things that i've always wanted to know but didn't even know were possible [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3089.2599999999998s)]
*  Right, but all of that to me goes to open ai and to x I use right right [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3095.18s)]
*  That's fine [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3099.58s)]
*  but i'm just saying like like if you were to because i'm what i'm trying to do is paint the picture of where the [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3100.06s)]
*  denominator [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3104.68s)]
*  Of quote search queries is going because if search queries is no longer the wrong way to think about this [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3105.74s)]
*  No, I like your I like it. I think i'm doing five times as many queries [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3110.7799999999997s)]
*  And I would say they're spread across a number of different platforms because instead of asking humans to do work [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3114.62s)]
*  I'm now doing it myself. You used to ask a human. Hey, can you do this research for me? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3121.3399999999997s)]
*  Right you would hire somebody you use to consult it now i'm doing it myself [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3125.82s)]
*  So you're on to something that the total volume the total pie could be five ten times bigger per person [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3128.78s)]
*  Yeah, if if the old paradigm is like measuring search queries and quote market share as a function of search queries [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3134.78s)]
*  I don't know if I care about having 99 percent of that [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3140.46s)]
*  Or if i'm actually better off having 80 percent of something that's now three times bigger [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3143.98s)]
*  Yes, where there's so much more use imagine you get you lose 99 percent of one bucket [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3149.1800000000003s)]
*  But you're only getting 10 or 20 percent of the new bucket. That's a bad scenario. That's exactly right [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3155.26s)]
*  That is the bad scenario issue guys that bucket is getting built right now and there are no where'sville in that bucket [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3160.54s)]
*  How are you going to show up in 18 months and say oh that new bucket? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3166.6200000000003s)]
*  That's so shiny pick me pick me. This is why it's a strategic error [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3169.58s)]
*  Well, think about the let's say you're running growth at facebook jamal and you guys have a new product you want to launch [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3174.2200000000003s)]
*  You've got a billion users [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3180.54s)]
*  How do you get them to use that new product because google has a chat gpt competitor [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3182.54s)]
*  How do you get them to use that product? Yeah, I walked through this [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3186.7799999999997s)]
*  Last week, but i'll do it again, which is [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3191.42s)]
*  I think that today the part that I agree with you is this whole view on search is antiquated and it makes no sense [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3193.66s)]
*  I think instead what you need to think about is where are the inbound [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3200.22s)]
*  actions into [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3204.38s)]
*  The house that is google, right google inc [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3205.82s)]
*  And you have to have a very simple way of deducing what is the value of that inbound action? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3209.26s)]
*  And if you rank them [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3215.26s)]
*  The inbound actions to the google search bar are obviously way more valuable than the inbound actions in all these other apps [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3216.94s)]
*  I would start in those places that are more bottom of the list on the money side [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3223.34s)]
*  But high on the list in terms of intention and behavior [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3227.26s)]
*  And I would redo the experience around gemini, but that requires taste [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3231.02s)]
*  And cannibalization that you're that you have to be willing to take the hit on which service you think is number one youtube [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3237.34s)]
*  I think your idea jason around youtube is a very smart one because it's a juggernaut business. I also think [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3242.38s)]
*  Workspace we use workspace here every day gmail calendar [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3248.36s)]
*  I think workspace could be really interesting as well gmail is a great one [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3253.5s)]
*  Yeah inside of gmail and it is going to get better like there are smart people thinking about this [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3257.1s)]
*  All i'm saying is that the market will now start to price this decay in [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3262.06s)]
*  I'm long. Well philippe. I want to know your bucket of what are the most important companies that matter the most [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3266.7000000000003s)]
*  Okay, i'll try but I have to ask you guys a question before [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3272.46s)]
*  Do you guys think that the two founders? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3276.3s)]
*  Come back in a very forceful way into the company. I don't know exactly why [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3279.1000000000004s)]
*  But one thing that I was wondering chamath is you you bring up a very important word taste [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3284.6200000000003s)]
*  Do you have to be a founder to be able to impose? [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3291.02s)]
*  This sort of new taste and you need sort of founder credibility [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3295.66s)]
*  At the junction at which google is at it seems like this is a big junction, right? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3301.18s)]
*  This is the first time in their 20 25 year history where I feel like whoa, there's a real threat [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3306.22s)]
*  How do you do that without the founders? [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3313.1s)]
*  And on top of that they're alive, you know, it's just they may not be at the company. Yes, serguey [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3315.66s)]
*  Yes, larry. No serguey's going to do it [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3318.86s)]
*  I think he's building up the reason we're seeing at the all-in events [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3320.94s)]
*  The reason he's going to work every day is that he's building up his knowledge base here [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3323.82s)]
*  And I don't want to speak for him [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3327.7400000000002s)]
*  But i've seen him really engaged on this stuff and the gemini app is kick ass and i've had long conversations with him about like [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3328.94s)]
*  Little details in the gemini app. He is super engaged like i've had conversations with him about granular [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3336.38s)]
*  Details of google local and youtube searches and how they should be presented in the results in the gemini app [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3342.46s)]
*  He's into it. You're bringing into it. You're bringing up something which I think is very important when you're at a junction this important [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3348.94s)]
*  Who has the gravitas to come in and actually make a difficult change like this? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3357.1800000000003s)]
*  I think in general it's the founders and you know in fairness to larry and serguey. These are two [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3361.7400000000002s)]
*  Brilliant brilliant guys. They've done it once [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3367.42s)]
*  And in fairness, they probably did it kind of a second time when they created alphabet because now you have these other businesses that are pretty impressive [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3370.54s)]
*  Now they're just gonna have to do it a third time [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3377.5s)]
*  But they're going to have to impose their will and they're going to have to develop some very specific days [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3379.26s)]
*  This is nothing against sundar and the team by the way [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3384.38s)]
*  This is just to say that [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3386.54s)]
*  The only people that can come in and say guys we're going to make a change that could have this negative impact to a 1.8 [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3388.2200000000003s)]
*  Trillion dollar company are people that are going to feel it the most they will feel it more than anybody else [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3393.58s)]
*  And so if they say that it should happen [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3398.94s)]
*  They'll have the moral credibility to make it so [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3401.82s)]
*  I love this question that you were just asked for you [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3405.02s)]
*  Go through your top 10 companies why you love them number. What's it? Not top 10? What's the number? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3407.58s)]
*  So wait, what are the companies that matter the most? [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3412.94s)]
*  Yeah [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3415.34s)]
*  so I have [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3416.38s)]
*  I've thought about that a lot. I'm not sure you know great answers, but the first one is [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3418.7s)]
*  I keep defaulting to the number 25 [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3424.46s)]
*  I can't explain you why [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3427.58s)]
*  But they're not 100 companies, but if you think there's only five and all these money managers, you know [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3429.58s)]
*  They have like five stocks that represent 80 [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3435.18s)]
*  I feel the level of risk that you're taking is too high and that one has to be you know [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3438.7799999999997s)]
*  I start with a home with a public market [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3443.66s)]
*  I'd say most french people are not known to be particularly humble [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3446.86s)]
*  But at least if you've been in the stock market as a french guy, you've been beaten up so bad [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3451.2599999999998s)]
*  I started January 1st 2000 [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3457.7400000000002s)]
*  So imagine what my first three years looked at I got reduced to you know ashes [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3460.06s)]
*  Just beaten up by the market. You know, we we did reasonably well [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3465.5s)]
*  uh because uh [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3469.98s)]
*  Thank god being a hedge fund, you know, you have different tools that you can do [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3471.42s)]
*  And so I think you need to have a certain number of stocks. You need to know [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3475.34s)]
*  that [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3480.06s)]
*  Some stuff you get lucky some stuff you get unlucky some stuff you get right and some stuff you get wrong [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3480.94s)]
*  And then [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3488.14s)]
*  I think that there's a second phenomenon. Once you agree to the 25 [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3489.66s)]
*  You say wait a minute. Why are there no ipos? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3494.06s)]
*  Why are these private companies amazing private companies some of the best in the world spacex? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3497.26s)]
*  Stripe answer that question. Why open ai why? [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3503.42s)]
*  in your mind [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3507.1s)]
*  I think [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3508.78s)]
*  That the cost of being public [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3510.7000000000003s)]
*  Is uh too difficult one [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3513.26s)]
*  What I think [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3516.1400000000003s)]
*  like the [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3517.9s)]
*  Regulation the regulatory like you get busted like left and right [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3519.58s)]
*  by uh agencies and like when's the last time that a public company I think that [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3526.2200000000003s)]
*  You know during the last administration [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3532.2200000000003s)]
*  something like [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3535.26s)]
*  Someone told me I don't know if it's true or not [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3536.7000000000003s)]
*  But I love the I love the quote so much that i'm using it without checking if it's 100 true or not [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3538.46s)]
*  Something like 35 percent of the snp had an issue with a government agency in the last few years, right? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3545.02s)]
*  When's the last time that you guys remember a private company that has an issue with a government agency? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3552.14s)]
*  Like i'm sure it happens but like off the top of my mind. It seems like a fraction of that, right? [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3557.5s)]
*  And then I also think that the private markets have become so sophisticated [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3563.1s)]
*  That in essence like our private markets public markets that just trade three times a year [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3568.38s)]
*  Like, you know these companies they do these uh, uh rounds, you know once or twice they're becoming pretty sophisticated [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3573.42s)]
*  They match buyers and sellers [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3580.38s)]
*  And I think that's okay [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3582.54s)]
*  and then the last piece which I think that's a very bad piece for the four of us and all of us on this call and [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3584.54s)]
*  many of your [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3590.3s)]
*  listeners [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3592.14s)]
*  is that [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3593.58s)]
*  There's such a view that like large companies are bad and we got to bust them and we're not going to let them do any [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3595.2599999999998s)]
*  M&A and as a result of that small companies no longer get bought by big ones [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3602.3s)]
*  And for me, it's a disaster because if I fund small companies [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3607.26s)]
*  But now you take away one of the best ways that I have to monetize my investment [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3610.94s)]
*  Why should I invest in risky private companies? I can just buy the public one [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3615.42s)]
*  And so i'm really hoping that as part of this deregulatory move and you guys [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3619.82s)]
*  And sacks will have way more influence than we but to convince people that in my mind [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3624.3s)]
*  The best way to create competition is to allow these large companies [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3629.82s)]
*  To fight against each other and the battle between open ai and google is the best way [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3634.38s)]
*  To do that, but not by telling google not to buy something or telling open [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3639.98s)]
*  Let's double click on that philippe. I think it's a super important point the singles that doubles in the industry [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3644.3s)]
*  I've been harping about this on this program as well. So we're simpatico [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3649.9s)]
*  What about a proposal where? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3653.74s)]
*  Maybe the non-mag 7 let's let's pick a number under a trillion market cap under 750 billion [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3655.9799999999996s)]
*  We let those companies buy and sell each other at a very vibrant pace [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3661.74s)]
*  We saw chat chp t buy a three billion dollar company. I think this past week in the um [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3665.8199999999997s)]
*  Kind of uh coding space like I mentioned earlier in the program door dash bought two companies [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3671.02s)]
*  What if we said hey, okay, we understand google getting bigger apple getting bigger microsoft getting bigger [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3676.06s)]
*  What's the rationale for that? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3681.2599999999998s)]
*  How does this rationale would be but how does size make a difference to whether or not someone should buy a company very simple [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3682.94s)]
*  Because they have such a market dominant position. That's different. Just hold on. Let me finish my sentence [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3688.46s)]
*  they have such a market dominant position when a company like [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3693.42s)]
*  Apple has you know half of the mobile phones or google has chrome [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3697.82s)]
*  Android plus all these things that they could shove that product for free down the throats of users price dump it which is illegal [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3703.42s)]
*  And create less competition in the future, but if you said door dash [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3711.26s)]
*  And lift or you know coinbase plus a stable coin company [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3715.5s)]
*  This would build the max 7 to the max 70 and then you would have many more larger companies. What do you think of this? [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3720.86s)]
*  Philippe i'll respond to that because I don't think that that makes any sense and I think that the the comments you're making about [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3728.7000000000003s)]
*  Size shouldn't drive these decisions the fact that apple for example has a minority market share [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3736.22s)]
*  In operating systems on mobile phones remember android is the majority that's right. It's no longer true in the u.s [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3742.7799999999997s)]
*  By the way, right now you are globally right and apple comes along and says hey, I want to buy a car company [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3748.46s)]
*  Or I want to buy something else. Why should that affect consumers in any way whatsoever? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3755.1s)]
*  It the ultimate objective of antitrust authority is to prevent monopolistic practices [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3760.38s)]
*  That hurt consumers and hurt the market and take away options and choice and freedom in the market [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3765.74s)]
*  But if companies want to make [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3771.82s)]
*  Orthogonal acquisitions if companies want to continue to grow and become a you know, a large holding company [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3774.14s)]
*  Why should we step in and say oh you're too big now ultimately jason you're you could see that threshold very quickly becoming a slippery slope [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3781.02s)]
*  That leads to a general like anti-capitalist concept where people say well [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3788.62s)]
*  Let's stop all companies from getting bigger than a billion or let's stop them all getting bigger than 100 million now and [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3792.78s)]
*  That that is a very slippery slope scale shouldn't matter at the end of the day protecting consumers from [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3799.02s)]
*  Monopolistic or antitrust practices should be the objective of these antitrust authorities [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3805.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think my response to that would be [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3810.7000000000003s)]
*  Except in the case where the bundling as we talked about in previous episodes makes so any of the large companies can just hold on [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3812.94s)]
*  Let me finish my sentence again [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3820.5400000000004s)]
*  In the case that a large company could kill all the competitors instantly by price dumping [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3822.54s)]
*  So you take something that people are paying for you know, like say robin hood or coinbase [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3828.62s)]
*  You you know google buys robin hood or apple buys coinbase and they just say everything's free [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3833.34s)]
*  We're going to make our money from our main business. Yes, it's better for consumers [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3838.22s)]
*  But it's not as good for a competition and in the long term then you would kill all the competitors and then they can do [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3841.66s)]
*  Unnatural acts that would be the argument. I'm not saying it's a perfect argument [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3848.22s)]
*  That's a great argument for what you're talking about [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3851.98s)]
*  It is not a great argument for stopping companies above a threshold of of market cap from doing stuff and companies [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3853.8999999999996s)]
*  Because the company below a threshold in market cap could have the same effect as what you're describing in a smaller market [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3859.8999999999996s)]
*  And they have to you have to be thoughtful about you're 100 correct [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3866.06s)]
*  If they're in the same arena, so coinbase robin hood and e-trade [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3869.5s)]
*  Merging could cause the same effect. You're right. Philippe [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3874.22s)]
*  What are your thoughts on just how to get the country out of this debate? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3876.7799999999997s)]
*  Because big companies bad [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3880.7s)]
*  No, we shouldn't let them do any mna the wrath of lena con. Is there a [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3882.9399999999996s)]
*  Is there an off ramp here can trump just, you know, laterally kind of make this happen? What are your thoughts or should he? [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3887.2599999999998s)]
*  oh, I think that to me one of the best part of being an investor of venture capital is [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3895.02s)]
*  When you have a really big idea and it works out it takes care of a lot of sins, you know [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3902.2999999999997s)]
*  There's a little aspect like would you like to play the lottery? [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3906.7799999999997s)]
*  If the lottery was capped like hey if you win the lottery you can't win more than [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3910.4599999999996s)]
*  30 million dollars 30 millions insane amount of money [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3916.62s)]
*  But I I read that there's some lottery guys who make one billion and two billion [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3919.8999999999996s)]
*  And the reason why people are willing to bet so much and most people are willing to lose [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3924.2999999999997s)]
*  Is they all think that they're gonna have this one ticket that's worth a billion and I think when you reduce the incentive the financial incentive [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3929.3399999999997s)]
*  Of and I agree with dave like success should be rewarded [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3937.02s)]
*  As much as possible, but if you've done something wrong then use these, you know the existing [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3941.18s)]
*  laws [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3946.86s)]
*  To define what success is. I don't think you can cap [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3947.82s)]
*  Because once you start capping and then what happens if the stock market goes down, do you then have to just? [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3951.42s)]
*  recap so [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3957.18s)]
*  But I agree with you you bring up an interesting point which is in these bundles like amazon prime bundle apple bundle [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3958.46s)]
*  There's a cosco bundle right? [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3966.46s)]
*  We seem to be living in this world of bundles where the stock market is willing to pay 40 50 times earnings [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3968.14s)]
*  Just for the you know, the membership fee as long as whatever you do on the side [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3974.94s)]
*  You basically make no money like cosco. I think makes 100 of its money more or less on a membership fee [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3980.3s)]
*  And trades for 50 60 times earnings [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3986.62s)]
*  There is a limit to like how big the bundle is before you start [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3989.34s)]
*  Dumping so I don't think i'm saying anything super interesting. I just hope that you don't cap the upside because that's what [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=3993.74s)]
*  Enables all of us to fund these new companies [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4001.8199999999997s)]
*  The reason why all of you guys and me were willing to fund these companies knowing [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4004.38s)]
*  That's many of them are going to fail is the hope that you get the next open ai [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4009.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's well said the power law shimoth. I think maybe a good time to maybe talk about private markets and liquidity and vc. Yeah [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4014.7s)]
*  I mean [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4020.7s)]
*  It's just so hard [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4023.3399999999997s)]
*  It's hard to make money [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4025.9s)]
*  and [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4028.46s)]
*  if you [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4030.46s)]
*  view making money as some [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4031.9s)]
*  derogatory thing [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4034.6s)]
*  And you put a bunch of impediments in the way [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4037.02s)]
*  the downstream impact is [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4039.98s)]
*  Interesting ways to make money will be out of fashion [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4042.22s)]
*  And simple ways of making money will be the only things that people do the problem is that society doesn't move forward [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4045.58s)]
*  If all you do are simple things you need people who are willing to put risk capital to buy these lottery tickets [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4051.98s)]
*  and if you [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4058.6200000000003s)]
*  Marginalize the upside you're just going to have exactly that a stagnant society of marginal things that doesn't move along [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4060.36s)]
*  And unless people fundamentally embrace that idea [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4067.9s)]
*  We're gonna lose we being america, yeah if you look for example in the last five year period [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4071.3399999999997s)]
*  in china or canada [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4077.1s)]
*  Where both of them two totally different political regimes, but they both had the same thing happen [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4079.8999999999996s)]
*  Which is the the the amount of investment capital? [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4084.7799999999997s)]
*  That went into both of those countries fell off of a cliff for two totally separate reasons [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4088.2999999999997s)]
*  What is interesting is going to be what is the downstream impact of that? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4095.1s)]
*  In 10 and 15 and 20 years [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4100.7s)]
*  And you can look historically back [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4103.5s)]
*  And we know what this looks like which is countries stagnate [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4106.0599999999995s)]
*  In the absence of investment in risk capital, so you will become a marginalized also ran country and you know [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4110.38s)]
*  Not to slag europe, but part of what europe got wrong [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4117.0199999999995s)]
*  Was that compact didn't exist too many administrators too many hall monitors? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4120.86s)]
*  Not enough ability to put risk capital to work and actually get gigantic outcomes [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4125.74s)]
*  So [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4130.0599999999995s)]
*  The most important thing we can do on that dimension [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4130.94s)]
*  Is to figure out how to have less regulation [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4134.38s)]
*  Have these companies fight it out [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4137.18s)]
*  And create the incentives for for these smaller businesses to be bought and or to go public [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4140.3s)]
*  So let's back this up with some data here nick pull up the chart on exits [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4145.82s)]
*  This is an important one for people to see we've had since the wrath of luna conn last four years under biden [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4149.82s)]
*  You know you had this 2021 spike of ipos peak zirp a lot of inventory a lot of risk capital have been put to work [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4155.740000000001s)]
*  For 10 years and after that 2021 spike things have been flatlined [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4162.22s)]
*  And companies are preferring to stay private and now we have venture capital constricting in terms of new funds being done and people are [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4168.46s)]
*  Making larger funds to do later and later stage investments and jason [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4175.820000000001s)]
*  It's constricting at the absolute worst time because what philippe said before is we're in the midst in the early phases [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4180.139999999999s)]
*  Of an entirely new economy that's going absolutely parabolic [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4186.94s)]
*  But the people that are supposed to accelerate that innovation and make these companies [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4191.9s)]
*  Come to life are going to run out of gas because if they don't return money to their limited partners [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4196.62s)]
*  Where are they going to get the incremental capital from? [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4202.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's the retail investors and sovereign wealth funds outside the u.s [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4204.62s)]
*  Seem to be the answer to that question lead to a normalized market philippe and chamath. So ultimately [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4208.3s)]
*  Shouldn't the exit volume? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4214.62s)]
*  Define the amount of capital that lps should invest in this asset class [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4217.02s)]
*  To get an out a return that compensates them for the illiquidity relative to public markets the same kind of risk levels [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4222.06s)]
*  At the end of the day it is what it is [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4228.54s)]
*  And you're going to see a reduction in venture dollars and that's just the market normalizing the economy only grows [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4231.26s)]
*  And only innovates at a certain pace is maybe is what the data shows [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4237.34s)]
*  I think the way that I think about this as an lp and maybe philippe can talk about this as a gp but as an lp when I [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4241.18s)]
*  think about putting capital into different funds [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4247.740000000001s)]
*  I have a base return in my mind, which is I want [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4252.22s)]
*  After taxes net of everything to generate about 10 percent a year [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4255.42s)]
*  That's where my risk of ruin is basically zero it compounds to infinity. I like the profile of my return of my assets [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4259.42s)]
*  How do I get to 10? [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4266.86s)]
*  Well, sometimes when i'm holding short-term stuff, i'm only generating four or five percent in paper [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4268.299999999999s)]
*  So then I have to go out on the risk curve [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4273.099999999999s)]
*  So I talked to a hedge fund. They're going to give me [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4275.179999999999s)]
*  12 or 13 net maybe in some cases I try to understand their risk, but I can only get so much working [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4277.9s)]
*  So then I have to go further out on the risk curve [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4283.74s)]
*  Then I talked to some private credit and private equity guys who tell me yes [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4285.58s)]
*  I can give you mid-teens returns that I do the analysis on that and I think okay [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4288.7s)]
*  I'll give you some money, but they are going to lock me up for five or six years [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4292.86s)]
*  It's still not enough to get to a blended rate of return of 10 percent [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4297.0199999999995s)]
*  So then I go yet further out on the risk curve. I call my friends at sequoia and all these other places [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4299.98s)]
*  And when you talk to the venture investors [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4305.42s)]
*  The problem is you are so illiquid [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4308.86s)]
*  for so long [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4311.82s)]
*  That the rates of return need to be in the mid to high 20s net to me [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4313.9s)]
*  But when you look at the data of what's possible [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4317.9s)]
*  They actually look like a three and four year [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4324.139999999999s)]
*  hedge fund and part of the reason is because of this [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4327.0199999999995s)]
*  strangulation of illiquidity that's caused artificially by [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4331.4s)]
*  administrations by regulations and by agencies like the ftc [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4335.48s)]
*  The question is if they didn't exist or if the regulations were [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4341.66s)]
*  A lot smaller. What would the upside return be? [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4346.14s)]
*  It's probably 500 to a thousand basis points higher much higher 100. Yeah, but I think at current course and speed [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4350.06s)]
*  With the lack of ipos and with the lack of mna [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4358.7s)]
*  You can't justify [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4362.46s)]
*  That asset class on its own in my opinion unless you think about it as like something that you're doing almost philanthropically [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4364.62s)]
*  Unless capital comes out and then prices come down and then return multiples go [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4371.36s)]
*  Let me put some numbers on this [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4376.56s)]
*  Here's the second chart annual ipos and just give you some you know broad strokes here of how amazing 2021 was for a lot of firms [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4377.92s)]
*  Rivian went out at 66 billion a firm at 24 billions qualtrics 25 billion robin hood [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4386.08s)]
*  Which I was involved in one of the first investors 30 billion duelingo 5 billion toast etc [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4391.04s)]
*  Roblox 42 billion square space and then you had all this mna square apply bought [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4396.4s)]
*  after pay for 29 billion zoom acquired 5 9 for 15 billion mail chip remember that one 12 billion microsoft and nuance the [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4403.04s)]
*  spoken the [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4410.32s)]
*  Language models 20 million. Do you know what the distribution? Do you know what the distribution of these ipos were by method? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4412.32s)]
*  spack versus direct listing versus traditional ipo [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4419.12s)]
*  I don't have that here. We'd have to do it not just on the names but also on the amount [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4422.64s)]
*  Distributed yeah, that's a good question. You know when I look at that data [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4426.78s)]
*  what what what I look at if if you just bring it back for one second is [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4430.24s)]
*  ever since you know, the 20 and 21 which were [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4435.6s)]
*  very high [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4439.92s)]
*  if you look at 22 23 24 and now the 25 i'm like [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4441.52s)]
*  How is this that it's worse than oh four oh five oh six that were normal years [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4446.56s)]
*  How is this worse than 13 and 14 and 15? Yeah, and she's scared the hell out of people. She scared people correct [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4452.4800000000005s)]
*  Mna i've talked to eminy people fleab and they have said it's not even worth bringing it to the board [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4460.160000000001s)]
*  If she doesn't the discussion she can't connect the dots, you know, she's like [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4466.400000000001s)]
*  I want people to not [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4471.6s)]
*  You know play the lottery anymore. I don't care for them. She doesn't understand that our system is based on this risk-taking [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4473.92s)]
*  And so listen, I think it's almost I think it's also a change [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4482.0s)]
*  It's also worse than that. I think that they probably look at like adobe figma [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4486.320000000001s)]
*  And they look at the cap table and they probably just make a judgment that hey [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4491.52s)]
*  I don't want these people to be billionaires yuck. I hate these people [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4495.280000000001s)]
*  But they don't understand to your point the waterfall effect of not returning capital [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4499.12s)]
*  To all kinds of other investors who are in the business of taking risk. It's like collateral damage [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4503.599999999999s)]
*  You know one of the things I feel none of these people understand so well is like all the collateral damage [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4508.5599999999995s)]
*  You think you're moving in one direction and all these dominoes sort of fall around you [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4514.48s)]
*  Exactly. Well the second and third order impacts this cascade, you know, it's ford foundation. It's harvard. It's [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4520.879999999999s)]
*  California retirement. Those are the people who are they going to be the beneficiaries and the third thing because i've been talking to a lot of [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4528.16s)]
*  Geographies in the middle east japan australia singapore, etc asia [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4535.02s)]
*  They all want to recreate what we have here. Well, what we've created here in silicon valley and in america [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4540.56s)]
*  Is these diasporas that start when a company like google goes public and then those people go create facebook or go work at facebook [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4545.68s)]
*  Like sherell sandberg did and they accelerate the growth there and then those people become angel investors [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4552.72s)]
*  They become lps [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4557.2s)]
*  This incredible flywheel was cooking [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4558.8s)]
*  I mean it was so smooth and now we've literally stuck a stick in it and the cars went over and you you don't have [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4562.24s)]
*  the downstream effect of [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4569.76s)]
*  canva in australia [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4571.84s)]
*  But I don't know if you know that company has done incredibly well phenomenal. They were oh you are involved [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4573.36s)]
*  Yeah, we're we're involved [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4578.639999999999s)]
*  But sorry just one thing I would add because it makes what you said so much more powerful on top of that when these people die [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4580.24s)]
*  Most of them gave all their money away to foundation, which is something very different between the us and europe [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4586.96s)]
*  In europe a lot of the wealth and in many other countries outside of the europe the wealth basically continues for generations [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4593.2s)]
*  In america these people build companies create new companies invest in new companies coach new companies mentor new companies [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4600.5599999999995s)]
*  And where they die all that money goes to foundation that continue to promote and do some of the work that governments were doing finally [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4607.839999999999s)]
*  How great is it that some foundations are competing with the government to decide what needs to be done? [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4616.320000000001s)]
*  And as opposed to a larger government, right and so that ultimately serves the doge mission [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4621.84s)]
*  Atlassian and those incredible founders who did gira etc bought other companies they wound up being the seed investors in [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4627.1s)]
*  Blackbird the the venture firm in australia that did canva and they were the investors in canva both of those companies are creating [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4635.04s)]
*  This incredible flood of entrepreneurship in australia [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4641.76s)]
*  And we're breaking that in america australia copied that playbook [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4645.6s)]
*  I want to know about the new fund you're doing philippe and why maybe you could explain to people [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4649.04s)]
*  I guess this is one of these [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4653.6s)]
*  What do they call it closed or open end funds and they operate differently than venture ones and also the seating you [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4656.08s)]
*  You seeded it in a very unique way with a couple of very unique family offices. Yeah, well you guys are nice to ask and [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4662.160000000001s)]
*  Couple of you have tweeted some nice things about it. So I I really appreciate it. I loved it. I loved it [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4669.200000000001s)]
*  Let me tell you [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4675.28s)]
*  The the a bit the story behind it, right? So I was like on one hand [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4677.12s)]
*  You've got private funds. They're only available for the super super rich like you gotta be uh, like, you know [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4682.32s)]
*  A super duper accredited investor you put your money in there and you might not see anything for 10 years [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4689.12s)]
*  And then for me as a gp [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4695.4400000000005s)]
*  Every three years I need to raise a new one of these funds [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4697.4400000000005s)]
*  So god forbid we have one fund that doesn't work and we raise the next one or not, right? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4700.0s)]
*  So that was on one side of it [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4704.5599999999995s)]
*  And then on the public side what basically is going on in the public is very strange [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4706.639999999999s)]
*  But in essence the black rocks of the world and the vanguards of the world and make it that almost everybody wants to invest in an index [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4713.2s)]
*  And as a result of that the people who are still active managers, they're all basically closet indexers [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4720.879999999999s)]
*  Because the risk of being wrong [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4727.679999999999s)]
*  You're you do better for 10 years and then you do worse for one year. You're out [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4729.679999999999s)]
*  So basically the public market everybody wants to index which is I think why the max seven, you know [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4734.160000000001s)]
*  is so big and stuff like that and [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4740.320000000001s)]
*  The other part that's weird with the public markets is since everybody needs to be indexed [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4743.52s)]
*  Everybody needs to be fully invested at all times. I'm like why? [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4747.92s)]
*  Why is it that you need to be fully invested in 1999 if the p multiple of the market is 60? [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4751.84s)]
*  Why is it that you want to be fully invested when you're already down 10 things are not working? [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4757.92s)]
*  Why not raise cash a lot? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4763.36s)]
*  sort of you know freshen up your ideas a little bit go take a long walk on the beach and try to [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4765.52s)]
*  Uh understand maybe you've made some mistakes and stuff like that [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4771.44s)]
*  So i've always wanted to do two things which is one on the public side [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4774.96s)]
*  Have the ability to be different in the stocks that I own but also that if i'm nervous [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4778.96s)]
*  Then what's wrong with holding cash and I hate to put this in the same word [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4785.12s)]
*  But you look at berkshire had a way today everybody wants to compare themselves to berkshire a little bit [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4789.04s)]
*  But berkshire today is a trillion dollar company a third in cash a third in public equities a third in private equities, right? [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4794.24s)]
*  And so I was like, okay. Well, what if we have a system where we can be in public stocks? [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4801.52s)]
*  We can be in private [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4807.28s)]
*  Companies, but we also can be in lots of cash and where investors know on day one [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4809.44s)]
*  Please do not compare me to an index if you come in you got to give me sort of five or seven years [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4815.12s)]
*  To do my work [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4821.6s)]
*  And i'm also going to let you take a little bit of money every year [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4822.96s)]
*  So in essence i'm willing to work at much lower fees because you give me capital for longer [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4827.04s)]
*  But you don't give me the capital forever and you're not stuck forever [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4834.24s)]
*  and so these interval funds [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4838.96s)]
*  are really interesting [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4841.52s)]
*  because uh, I think the minimum investment is like [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4843.44s)]
*  $50,000 or something like that and the conditions to qualify for such a fund are much smaller [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4847.66s)]
*  So there's many more investors that can come and I look at it a little bit of like this is the democratizations of tech investing [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4853.28s)]
*  And I really believe in it. I've been doing my thing for 30 years for institutional investors. Why can I do it for like [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4860.719999999999s)]
*  People who don't have access to let me ask you a question you have what 53 billion under management [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4868.08s)]
*  Something like that something in that zone. So, I mean obviously you've been phenomenally [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4874.96s)]
*  successful [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4879.58s)]
*  Talk about the fees and the carry [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4880.72s)]
*  And how you decided? [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4883.280000000001s)]
*  How to set that and then tell us how your competitors reacted when you announced this fund i'm very curious about [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4885.360000000001s)]
*  That both of those two things. Yeah [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4892.88s)]
*  so [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4895.52s)]
*  We got a little bit lucky in that we studied the fees of other [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4897.04s)]
*  Funds, these are things called interval funds [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4901.2s)]
*  and [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4904.16s)]
*  it seems like the fees were more like [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4905.04s)]
*  1.25 and 12 and so we're like well [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4908.62s)]
*  Can we live at 1.25 and 12 and I was like, yeah, you know, it's a really good deal [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4911.84s)]
*  For other people but I get something for it, which is I get near permanent capital and in exchange for that near permanent capital [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4917.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm willing to live at lower fees because I think i'm going to be able to compound it for longer [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4925.28s)]
*  So in essence, it's not like i'm being altruistic. I'm not claiming [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4930.88s)]
*  Oh, I just want to do a good deal for people is i'm being selfish [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4934.4s)]
*  If I can compound capital at 12 and a half percent incentive fee for a very long time [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4938.08s)]
*  It's better than 20 percent for a short period of time [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4942.16s)]
*  And for the investor, I love the fact that i'm sort of investing like if you told me philip start from scratch [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4945.68s)]
*  Right on a little blank piece of paper. What would you do? [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4952.8s)]
*  I think all of us on the show would say well [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4955.92s)]
*  It would have to be something that looks like berkshire hathaway, right? [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4958.16s)]
*  Berkshire is the model and you want to do cash you want to do publics you want to do private [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4961.12s)]
*  You want it to be a good deal for people you want it to be permanent capital for you? [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4966.16s)]
*  And you want to try to be able to do that for a long time and I think that's sort of what those [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4970.5599999999995s)]
*  Things do and then I was like, okay [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4976.5599999999995s)]
*  But then the problem is like you have a snowball at the top of the mountain [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4978.72s)]
*  How do you get it to roll and to be big? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4981.92s)]
*  And I was like, you know, we're not very well known. I have to admit. This is sort of one of my first podcasts, you know [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4984.160000000001s)]
*  Ever so I really appreciate you're doing great being here with you guys [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4990.72s)]
*  So I was like I gotta get the ball rolling at the top [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4995.280000000001s)]
*  And so I thought okay, maybe I can get some tech entrepreneurs [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=4999.12s)]
*  To help me out who believe in this concept of democratizing tech investing and stuff like that [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5003.12s)]
*  So I went to see the family offices [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5008.16s)]
*  I didn't quite see the founders directly but the family offices for both the bezos family and then the dale family [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5010.48s)]
*  And I sort of pitched them the idea they like the idea then we pitched it [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5016.72s)]
*  To the founders and then we got to some agreement and they gave us a combined billion dollars to get going [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5021.5199999999995s)]
*  And then we're also going to put a lot of personal money in it and I was like great [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5027.36s)]
*  And I had read I don't know if it's true that the largest fund [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5031.84s)]
*  That was ever launched was the one of the first blackstone song was 1.3. So then I said, okay [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5035.04s)]
*  I need to launch the fund. That's 1.301 like that. I can claim that it's the largest launch [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5040.240000000001s)]
*  Ever so I don't know if i'll get there or not [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5047.12s)]
*  But that was the idea and I think it's nice to have the backing of these guys [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5049.360000000001s)]
*  So typically what happens is people come to see me in my office [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5053.6s)]
*  I'll ask some folks to do diligence and then I sign up to an lpa [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5057.76s)]
*  Is that how this works like if i'm interested what is that what I do now I or is this totally different [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5062.24s)]
*  You mean you as an lp now? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah me. It's just a normal person. So, uh, [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5067.679999999999s)]
*  This fund in particular starts to be marketed by [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5072.16s)]
*  One of the wall street firms. It's in this one. Uh, we picked ubs. They were the first ones who believed in us [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5075.599999999999s)]
*  but many other firms [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5081.5199999999995s)]
*  Will work with others and we have great relationships with jp morgan and others [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5084.08s)]
*  So in time you'll be available on all these different platforms and then [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5088.0s)]
*  most of the people that we target [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5093.68s)]
*  Usually have a relationship with a wealth management firm and our hope in time [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5096.16s)]
*  Is to work with a bit the leading [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5101.92s)]
*  Wealth management firms and uh, you can invest and frankly i'm like hey just start giving me a little bit of money [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5104.4s)]
*  See if you like what I do on that [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5111.36s)]
*  How many people can be involved because when you do venture obviously there are caps [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5113.44s)]
*  You can only sell to accredited and qualified purchases. That's about six percent of the country and you can only [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5118.5599999999995s)]
*  have [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5124.5599999999995s)]
*  99 accredited investors in a in a venture fund [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5125.82s)]
*  And then it's I think uncapped and then you can have 200 you can have up to 10 million and they can be 250 [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5130.719999999999s)]
*  I did this when I did our fourth fund [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5136.32s)]
*  And I had 120 million in interest I can only take 10 million of the accredits [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5139.360000000001s)]
*  So it really is capped in the venture space, but you're doing a different type of vehicle [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5143.68s)]
*  Is there a cap on the number of lps you can have? [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5147.76s)]
*  Of course I knew I should be more prepared doing this. I don't remember exactly all the caps are but the point is [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5150.64s)]
*  Is that the number of people that can join the fund is much greater? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5156.64s)]
*  And the number and the amount of money that can put in is also much smaller [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5160.72s)]
*  And as a result of that you're reaching a wider audience [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5166.32s)]
*  And that particular audience they're happy because if you think about that fun, right one thing that's a pain in the ass [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5169.92s)]
*  How do you manage all the capital calls? They drive me crazy. How do you manage all the distributions? [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5176.8s)]
*  Oh, I just got some stock in a public ipo. Should I keep it? Should I not keep it? [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5182.32s)]
*  Is it a good company like google that's going to 20x post ipo or is it another company that I should just sell immediately? [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5186.48s)]
*  Right, you basically have one structure it manages everything and then you get a 1099 instead of like a bunch of k1 [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5193.6s)]
*  So do you think like sequoia and drees and cosla [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5202.160000000001s)]
*  founders fund how do they [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5206.4800000000005s)]
*  Respond that's question one and then two [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5209.1s)]
*  Does it change the behavior of the fundraising cycle or process for you and your partners when you're evaluating companies? [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5212.4800000000005s)]
*  Or for the entrepreneurs like does any of that change? So how do how does how does competition react and then how [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5219.12s)]
*  Do companies and ceos react? [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5225.2s)]
*  Listen [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5229.4400000000005s)]
*  When you start worrying about your competitors [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5231.12s)]
*  In my mind, it's a bit of a version of the grass is greener elsewhere [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5234.240000000001s)]
*  And you have to focus on ourselves. It's such a hard business [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5238.72s)]
*  There's so many smart people and this and that [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5242.88s)]
*  We tried to design something that plays to our strength and our strength was we got the public markets [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5245.92s)]
*  We got the private markets and then we've got risk management with the cash and knowing when to be in and out [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5252.639999999999s)]
*  I would suspect that other people [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5258.639999999999s)]
*  Will do the same. Hopefully it'll be different because they have different strengths and stuff like that [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5261.2s)]
*  and I thought that what was nice for us is to sort of [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5268.0s)]
*  Uh do this a bit of a hybrid? [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5272.08s)]
*  Uh public private and frankly in private you guys think there's venture. There's the growth capital [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5274.4s)]
*  There's private equity this vehicle could own 100 of a company you could do that [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5279.84s)]
*  You could go up and down. So what is your plan then to do with private companies specifically? Do you see yourself? [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5285.04s)]
*  You know leading a series a or participating in one of those or buying secondary in spacex on the open market [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5290.88s)]
*  From former employees maybe buying out strips of other venture firms that are looking to wind down or get early [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5297.04s)]
*  Liquidity and you come into some, you know mid-sized [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5303.84s)]
*  300 million dollar fund and buy out 20 of it. What's the strategy here with private specifically? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5307.18s)]
*  This is a good point. It's a bit like hey, so what's your north star? [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5313.04s)]
*  Don't tell me you can do everything like what are you going to really do? Right? [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5316.16s)]
*  And to me the north star is [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5320.0s)]
*  Uh, jason, I got a build for you in 10 years [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5322.400000000001s)]
*  the new mag seven [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5326.08s)]
*  That's my job [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5327.84s)]
*  Find the best we know who are the 10 largest companies in the snp or the nasdaq today [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5329.2s)]
*  What are they going to be? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5335.2s)]
*  In 10 years some are already public. They're just going to get bigger [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5337.12s)]
*  And some are private so to that extent. I don't believe that necessarily venture [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5342.24s)]
*  Is the right model for this particular? [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5347.5199999999995s)]
*  Because it's like uh, it's a thousand to one to go from a zero to one million in revenue [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5350.4s)]
*  Then it's a hundred to one to go to ten million. That's the insight that and you mentioned this on our call earlier today [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5356.48s)]
*  That I actually think is really really really powerful [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5364.0s)]
*  The mag seven was this set of correlated seven companies that sucked up all the attention all the money [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5368.24s)]
*  They moved in unison dollar for dollar [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5374.88s)]
*  Now that that correlation has broken down [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5377.679999999999s)]
*  It allows you to ask this question which is what is the real mag x companies? [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5380.72s)]
*  And to your point if it's a [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5388.8s)]
*  25 company basket [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5390.5599999999995s)]
*  You're absolutely right like space x would be in the basket. It's private [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5393.04s)]
*  So stripe would be in the basket like so to be long [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5397.28s)]
*  Some rando public company because it's public and ignore space x and stripe would just be stupid [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5400.5599999999995s)]
*  So to your point that is really that's really powerful the the optimal [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5406.96s)]
*  Basket of the companies you'd want to own for the future [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5412.56s)]
*  Because of these rules and regulatory burdens [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5416.320000000001s)]
*  Are partially public partially private and so you need a vehicle that can straddle both if you want to own it [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5419.4400000000005s)]
*  Yes, I think that that makes a ton of sense to me [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5424.8s)]
*  That's the idea and also like the people who choose with the max seven r [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5428.08s)]
*  It's like some employee at the msci world or will you something like that? [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5432.88s)]
*  Will you actually go out on a limb and try to publish what you think the version of that index is as you construct it inside of? [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5437.84s)]
*  That fund or we have some public requirements which will force us [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5445.04s)]
*  To do that the private markets are overheated. There's a lot of secondary offerings [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5449.44s)]
*  So if you try to get into stripe space x and roll or like there was recently one of these, you know [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5454.0s)]
*  Robotic companies that has zero revenue and wanted a 40 billion dollar [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5459.12s)]
*  You know valuation and there's all these civilians retail investors who are investing in your fund [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5464.24s)]
*  But also have direct access to these secondary markets [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5468.32s)]
*  I mean you also have to buy at the right price and these I know firsthand for the for those top companies are massively inflated you have [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5471.76s)]
*  30 40 billion dollar valuations on companies that are pre-revenue sometimes [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5479.2s)]
*  How do you think about that? I have no idea of the company you just referred to [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5483.36s)]
*  I have no idea which one it is. I don't want to say but yes [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5487.28s)]
*  Maybe they did maybe they did a trial with bmw that was in the factory or not in the factory. I don't know [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5490.72s)]
*  listen [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5496.8s)]
*  Humanoids is a pretty exciting area. I don't know what companies are but there is going like let me in in my top 25 [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5498.0s)]
*  I don't think I think it's a bit early [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5506.0s)]
*  I would have a humanoid company [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5508.32s)]
*  I'd have a robotaxi company [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5510.8s)]
*  You know, I try to find some whoever is the leader [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5513.28s)]
*  And I think the point that you make that's really good. Jason is we also have to wait to me [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5516.72s)]
*  There's two key things can I establish with 75% chance that this is the leader? [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5521.360000000001s)]
*  I don't want to do it if it's like a 1% chance. It is the leader. I got to pay more later [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5526.72s)]
*  That's one but two [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5531.76s)]
*  There's one advantage that the public markets have over the privates [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5534.0s)]
*  That we know how to value things because we have comps and we know about revenues and profits and earnings and p multiples [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5538.08s)]
*  And stuff like that [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5545.38s)]
*  Sometimes private investors. They just value a private company like hey if the last round was 100 [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5546.799999999999s)]
*  Well, this round's 200 and i'm like, but why you know, why is where the ceo is really good on camera and funny [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5552.16s)]
*  Twitter like doubles right? [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5559.12s)]
*  And so I think that in the growth business like being a public investor is important because it lets you at least say [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5561.04s)]
*  If this company were already public what it'd be worth [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5567.36s)]
*  and then [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5571.44s)]
*  When you own public company [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6HSFCQQ6O0&t=5572.96s)]
