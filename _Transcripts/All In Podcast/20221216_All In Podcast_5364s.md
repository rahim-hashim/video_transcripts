**All In Podcast:** [December 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88)
*  Captain Calacanis is here reporting for duty. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=0.0s)]
*  Wait, is that a Spirit Airlines cap? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3.72s)]
*  Absolutely, Spirit Airlines, I just wanted to say, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=5.4s)]
*  all in podcast, now sponsored by Montclair [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=8.36s)]
*  and Spirit Airlines. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=11.56s)]
*  Or now sponsored by the Village People. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=12.72s)]
*  YMCA. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=16.8s)]
*  Now are you a pilot or a flight attendant, J Cal? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=18.96s)]
*  He's a flight attendant. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=21.28s)]
*  I don't think he's thin enough to be a flight attendant. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=22.68s)]
*  Are you fat shaming me? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Are you body shaming me? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=26.04s)]
*  You can't do that nowadays, that'll get you canceled. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=26.88s)]
*  Getting SACS canceled at this point, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=29.32s)]
*  fat shaming would be number 72 on the list. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=31.48s)]
*  He can't get canceled because all the libs [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  have left Twitter, there's nobody to. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  There's no hall monitors left? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=38.04s)]
*  That's not true, they all pretend. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=39.64s)]
*  No, they quit every week. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=41.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's like all the libs just said they moved to Canada [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=42.96s)]
*  when Trump got elected. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=44.88s)]
*  Yeah, Canada immigration. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=45.92s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=47.52s)]
*  What? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=48.36s)]
*  A hacker figured out a way to take all this data, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=49.2s)]
*  and track people's yachts, people's planes. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=55.080000000000005s)]
*  Obviously one of those people was Elon. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  Elon had a security issue, this is all public information. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  So the larger issue is that the data is not [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=66.12s)]
*  going to be used to track people's flights, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=69.12s)]
*  but it's going to be used to track people's flights. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=71.48s)]
*  So it's going to be a lot of data. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=74.12s)]
*  So it's going to be a lot of data. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=75.72s)]
*  So the larger issue at stake here is the fact that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  the law allows for people to do this persistent tracking [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=82.84s)]
*  of planes, which then becomes persistent tracking [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=88.4s)]
*  of a person. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=91.36s)]
*  And what really is at stake here is how we define [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=92.2s)]
*  the term doxing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  For people who don't know the term doxing, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  it means giving a person's location. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=97.2s)]
*  That could be your home, that could also be [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=98.76s)]
*  your at a location for some period of time. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=100.28s)]
*  You're at a hotel for a basketball game. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=102.08s)]
*  And it's pretty clear, you can take a picture of a celebrity [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=105.88s)]
*  and say there's a celebrity here, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=108.44s)]
*  oh, Lady Gaga's at the farmer's market. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=109.56s)]
*  What I object to here, we all understand doxing is dangerous [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=111.76s)]
*  and it in fact is against the law to just give people [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  addresses and stuff like that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  The issue here is a new type of doxing, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=121.04s)]
*  which I'll call persistent coordinated doxing, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=123.8s)]
*  where dozens of times a month [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=127.92s)]
*  you're giving a person's location. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=129.44s)]
*  It may not be against the First Amendment, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=131.4s)]
*  Sax, I think you would agree, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=134.24s)]
*  but we have to ask ourselves, do we wanna live in a world [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=136.04000000000002s)]
*  where whether a person's on an electric bicycle [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=139.0s)]
*  or an airplane or any device in between, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=141.16s)]
*  somebody should be releasing dozens of times a month [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=143.36s)]
*  a specific dedicated feed of their location. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=146.84s)]
*  It is terrorizing as a parent when this happens. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  I've had doxing, people on the call here [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=153.28s)]
*  have had various security concerns. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  We don't wanna live in a world with de facto doxing. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=157.56s)]
*  What these sites were doing was de facto doxing. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  I think it was a bad decision [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=163.28s)]
*  and I think that it represented, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=164.8s)]
*  the least generous statement would be [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=171.04s)]
*  that it represents deep hypocrisy [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=172.8s)]
*  in that not just a few weeks ago [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=175.2s)]
*  did he say he would never delete that account, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=176.76s)]
*  but he also said he was buying Twitter [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=179.04s)]
*  to enable freedom of speech and freedom of expression [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=181.2s)]
*  and that he wouldn't come in and do the same sort [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=183.6s)]
*  of content moderation that was done by the old regime. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=185.2s)]
*  And then he came in and did exactly what the old regime did, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=188.56s)]
*  which is that he took the rules [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=191.24s)]
*  and he took the quote moderation policies [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=192.48s)]
*  and he found a way to use them [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=195.0s)]
*  to make some editorialized decisions [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=197.2s)]
*  that he thought was appropriate. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  Now, the more generous thing is what you guys are saying, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=200.2s)]
*  which I don't think is necessarily wrong, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  which is that he's trying to protect people [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=204.88s)]
*  where there's some loophole or some law [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=207.32s)]
*  that doesn't seem right morally, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=209.44s)]
*  but it is the law and it is what it is. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  In those cases, I think you run into the exact same issue [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=214.12s)]
*  that the old guard at Twitter had, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=218.0s)]
*  that the moderators and the executives at YouTube [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=219.92s)]
*  have dealt with and that the executives [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=222.2s)]
*  at Google have dealt with and that we sit here [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=223.76s)]
*  and we criticize until you're on that side of the table [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  and you're forced to make these moderation decisions, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=228.83999999999997s)]
*  you're forced to make these policy decisions [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  and you're forced to implement these policy decisions [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=232.64s)]
*  because of some moral framework [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=235.04s)]
*  that you now think is appropriate. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  Some people will say that's not freedom of expression, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  that's not freedom of speech, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  you're taking that away from some people, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  you're taking this particular case away [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=245.23999999999998s)]
*  from a 15 or 16 year old kid who's built a Twitter feed. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=246.92s)]
*  And so I think what it shows is just how hard it is [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=251.2s)]
*  to moderate these sites, these platforms, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=254.32s)]
*  and that there is no simple, easy, idealistic, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=256.56s)]
*  ideologue of, hey, all these things are open, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=259.47999999999996s)]
*  all these things can be used by anyone all the time [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=262.32s)]
*  because as soon as one of these edge cases start to happen, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=264.76s)]
*  you wanna come in and do something about it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=267.28s)]
*  Chamath, what do you think? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=268.68s)]
*  What should happen going forward? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=269.52s)]
*  So I have had these issues happen to me multiple times. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=270.52s)]
*  I'm not nearly as important as Elon is, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=275.44s)]
*  but it feels the same when you're in the middle of it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=279.8s)]
*  It feels pretty terrorizing. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=283.36s)]
*  That being said, I think the real decision [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=286.12s)]
*  for somebody like me is that if it's too much [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=288.72s)]
*  is frankly just to get rid of it [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=292.18s)]
*  and to find a different mode of transportation [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=293.82s)]
*  that's a little bit more anonymous. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=296.76s)]
*  And the reason I say that is that I just think [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  that you would have to go and get the government [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=301.76s)]
*  to basically change the law, which they're not going to do. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=304.0s)]
*  And so then as a result, your reaction will seem [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=306.8s)]
*  somewhat contrived and deeply personal. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=310.48s)]
*  And in that, I think you lose credibility. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=313.08s)]
*  Let me just summarize this [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  and be the first one to just state this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=316.28s)]
*  I think that if there's any person in the world [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=319.0s)]
*  that can figure out Twitter, it's probably Elon, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=321.24s)]
*  but man has he taken on just a gargantuan battle. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  And increasingly, I am not a fan of this battle, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=329.74s)]
*  and I'll tell you why. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=333.28s)]
*  This is a man who has essentially proven [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=335.0s)]
*  that he can bend the laws of physics on behalf of humanity. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=338.36s)]
*  He's done it twice, once in electric cars [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=341.48s)]
*  and once in rocketry. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=344.72s)]
*  The problem is that the realm of decision-making at Twitter [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=346.74s)]
*  has nothing to do with the laws of physics [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=349.52s)]
*  and is governed by emotions and psychology, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=351.92s)]
*  in which there is no canonically right answer. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=355.92s)]
*  And so he's quickly finding out that half the population [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=358.68s)]
*  will always find fault with him, no matter what he does. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=361.64s)]
*  And now the implication of that becomes very important. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  We saw yesterday that he had to sell [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=369.88s)]
*  another $3.8 billion of Tesla stock. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=372.2s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=375.64s)]
*  It's because this transaction, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=377.08s)]
*  which was very tight to get done, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=379.32s)]
*  probably required lots of margin. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=382.12s)]
*  Look, I have a margin loan at Credit Suisse, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=385.8s)]
*  so I know how these things work. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=387.96s)]
*  And you can very quickly get margin called. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=389.48s)]
*  You have to sell down things that you own [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=391.76s)]
*  in order to maintain your collateral limits. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=393.48s)]
*  We've talked about this before. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=395.9s)]
*  He's had to do this twice now in the last few weeks. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=397.48s)]
*  And that's because, again, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=399.76s)]
*  not because of the demand at Tesla, as far as we can tell, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=401.42s)]
*  but because people believe he's distracted. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=405.04s)]
*  And so people are anticipating weakness at Tesla. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=407.15999999999997s)]
*  People are now shorting the stock. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=409.52s)]
*  Anyways, it's causing this downward spiral. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=411.6s)]
*  And can he fix it? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=415.56s)]
*  I think so. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=417.48s)]
*  Can he pull it all out? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=418.32s)]
*  Is it just putting himself under an enormous amount [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=420.4s)]
*  of pressure that he could have avoided? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=424.56s)]
*  Somewhat, yes. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=426.59999999999997s)]
*  And I think that this is sort of where we're at. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=428.23999999999995s)]
*  Six weeks in. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=432.03999999999996s)]
*  My gosh. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=433.52s)]
*  Totally. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=434.35999999999996s)]
*  I was saying, this guy learned in six weeks [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=435.2s)]
*  what it took YouTube seven years to learn, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=437.44s)]
*  how hard it is to moderate content. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=439.59999999999997s)]
*  And I think the thing that- [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  No, this is where I disagree is, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=442.76s)]
*  you're attributing so much good faith [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=445.4s)]
*  to these content moderators at YouTube and Twitter, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=448.66s)]
*  when the Twitter files reveal [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=451.98s)]
*  that they made no effort to suppress their bias. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=454.06s)]
*  In fact, they were pretty much- [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=457.26s)]
*  Wait, can you- [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=459.38s)]
*  Okay, before you react to that- [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=460.22s)]
*  Dancing in the streets every time they booted off [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=462.54s)]
*  someone they didn't like. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=465.1s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=465.94s)]
*  Before you react to what Freebird just said at the end, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=466.78000000000003s)]
*  that coda, can you respond to what I just said? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=468.18s)]
*  Isn't it true? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=470.06s)]
*  Well, look, if you define what Elon is doing there [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=471.42s)]
*  as acting as a judge arbitrating [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=476.26s)]
*  on every little content moderation decision, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=481.06s)]
*  is that a great use of his time [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=483.86s)]
*  relative to what he could be building at Tesla and SpaceX [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=485.53999999999996s)]
*  and doing on behalf of humanity? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=488.02s)]
*  Then no, clearly not. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=489.68s)]
*  But if you define what he's doing in the larger sense [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=491.14s)]
*  as restoring free speech [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=493.65999999999997s)]
*  to the most important town square social network, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=495.94s)]
*  hopefully thereby inspiring other tech companies [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=499.18s)]
*  to move in the direction of opening things up, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=502.56s)]
*  then I actually think it's a pretty good use of his time. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=505.18s)]
*  So look, I think we can quibble about this or that decision [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=507.34000000000003s)]
*  that he makes or this or that tweet, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=510.78000000000003s)]
*  but I think the overall thrust of what he's doing [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=513.1s)]
*  is very important for the country and for humanity. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=515.82s)]
*  So I get where you're coming from. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=519.5s)]
*  Hopefully he'll find some people at Twitter [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=521.14s)]
*  who he can empower and trust [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=523.82s)]
*  to make these content moderation decisions [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=525.92s)]
*  so he's not drawn into every single little battle, right? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=527.46s)]
*  We do want him focused on the highest priority problems. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=530.5600000000001s)]
*  My point is just that I get that. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=533.78s)]
*  I just think that what he's learning [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=535.62s)]
*  and what we're living and seeing in real time [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=537.4599999999999s)]
*  is that there is no canonically right decision ever [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=540.8199999999999s)]
*  in this space. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=544.18s)]
*  There's only a decision where some percentage will support [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=545.0799999999999s)]
*  and some percentage will always be against. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=548.3399999999999s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=550.18s)]
*  Correct. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=551.5s)]
*  He did say when he took over, he knew that would be the case. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=552.3199999999999s)]
*  He said, you will know I'm doing the good job [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=554.66s)]
*  when both sides are equally upset. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=556.8s)]
*  Just to put a pin in it, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=559.24s)]
*  I think it's important for people to understand [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=560.54s)]
*  what the new policy is. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=561.9399999999999s)]
*  So I'm just gonna quickly read it just to put a pin in it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=563.32s)]
*  Hang on one sec before you get to it [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=566.36s)]
*  because I think the philosophical point [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=568.1600000000001s)]
*  rather than the specific one is an important one. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=570.08s)]
*  And I just wanna respond to what Chamath said [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=572.7600000000001s)]
*  and have Sax respond to this. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=574.9200000000001s)]
*  In the case of the points you make around the Twitter files, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=577.1s)]
*  and by the way, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=579.84s)]
*  I don't agree with any of the moderation decisions personally. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=580.84s)]
*  So I don't think that someone should be suspended [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=583.88s)]
*  for posting public information. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=587.0s)]
*  I don't think someone should be suspended [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=588.6s)]
*  for saying controversial things. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=589.84s)]
*  That's my personal opinion. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=591.24s)]
*  I'm clear on that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=592.72s)]
*  Cause I know that that's been crossed. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=593.84s)]
*  You would describe yourself as a strong free speech. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=595.24s)]
*  Libertarian, strong, okay, got it. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=599.1600000000001s)]
*  And so in this particular case, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=601.2s)]
*  I think what really irked me, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=604.08s)]
*  I was trying to identify why it made me so angry [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=605.62s)]
*  when he did yesterday. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=607.72s)]
*  It triggered me, it really did. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=608.72s)]
*  And I think the reason was [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=610.0400000000001s)]
*  that in the case of the Twitter file points, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=611.46s)]
*  it was a minority that was affected. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=614.08s)]
*  It was one person that was affected [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=617.1600000000001s)]
*  because the majority wanted to do that thing to that person. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=619.72s)]
*  And I think in this case, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=622.96s)]
*  it's that the minority wants to affect the majority [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=624.62s)]
*  in the sense that Elon has aggregated this control [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=628.1600000000001s)]
*  and this power over moderation. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=630.76s)]
*  And he's benefiting himself [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=632.96s)]
*  and a few people that have private planes, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=634.4s)]
*  and he's shutting down hundreds of Twitter feeds [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=636.5600000000001s)]
*  that are using publicly available information. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=639.8000000000001s)]
*  And so it feels even more onerous [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=641.84s)]
*  of a use of power and influence [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=644.0s)]
*  because he's doing something that benefits a small number [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=648.58s)]

*  whereas the other one was affecting a small number [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=654.6600000000001s)]
*  that benefited a large number, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=658.6600000000001s)]
*  because that's what a lot of people wanted to see happen. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=659.82s)]
*  A lot of people wanted to see Trump suspended, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=662.14s)]
*  and it wasn't right either. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=664.22s)]
*  I don't know if that makes sense. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=665.7s)]
*  We understand your position completely. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=667.46s)]
*  I just want to add to that. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=668.82s)]
*  In this policy, I think it's very important to understand [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=671.0600000000001s)]
*  what he is saying about this. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=673.34s)]
*  Accounts dedicated to sharing someone else's live location [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=675.34s)]
*  are going to be suspended going forward. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=677.94s)]
*  You can still share your own location, obviously, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=679.9000000000001s)]
*  content required, content for public engagements, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=682.1800000000001s)]
*  the president is speaking somewhere, whatever. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=686.3800000000001s)]
*  You just really can't be persistently, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=688.22s)]
*  consistently tracking an individual otherwise known [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=690.82s)]
*  in plain speech as stalking. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=694.3800000000001s)]
*  But Jason, if NPR is live tweeting, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=696.98s)]
*  Jerome Powell's speech at XYZ location. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=700.58s)]
*  Not a problem. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=704.46s)]
*  If they do Jerome Powell's location for the next year, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=705.9399999999999s)]
*  for the next year, 10 times a week, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=709.9399999999999s)]
*  on his off duty, on duty, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=713.78s)]
*  that's something we're talking about here. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=715.78s)]
*  I'm just saying, let's just say he gives a speech [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=717.06s)]
*  every week. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=719.02s)]
*  Is that illegal? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=720.3s)]
*  No, if you're giving a speech at a public place [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=721.38s)]
*  where you've announced that you're going to be appearing [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=724.74s)]
*  at a certain time and place, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=727.18s)]
*  you've already made a public where you're going to be. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=728.38s)]
*  What we're talking about is, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=730.66s)]
*  and what Elon Jett was showing was a live stream [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=732.18s)]
*  of precision GPS coordinates [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=735.42s)]
*  over a sustained period of time. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=737.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=739.58s)]
*  And not to be too dramatic about it, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=740.42s)]
*  but if you look at the weapons that are so successfully [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=741.74s)]
*  being used in Ukraine right now, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=744.26s)]
*  they're all precision GPS guided. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=745.58s)]
*  Now, right now you have to be a state actor [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=747.82s)]
*  to get ahold of those weapons. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=749.3s)]
*  But you could imagine over the next decade [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=750.38s)]
*  that having someone's precise GPS coordinates [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=753.26s)]
*  over a sustained period of time, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=756.54s)]
*  it would be pretty easy to target them for, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=758.06s)]
*  and not to be dramatic here, but for assassination. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=760.3s)]
*  That is a security risk. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=762.9s)]
*  There's no way around that. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=764.38s)]
*  I brought this up with Palmer Lucky, man. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=765.5s)]
*  I'm scared that dude could come at me anytime [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=767.14s)]
*  when I get my jet. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=769.86s)]
*  I don't want Palmer Lucky taking me out. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=770.9399999999999s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=772.74s)]
*  Yo, Palmer, I'm sorry, dude. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=774.02s)]
*  Do not take me out. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=776.06s)]
*  I'm going to get my jet. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=777.18s)]
*  I'll be on my first flight, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=778.06s)]
*  and he's just going to send a drone in. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=779.54s)]
*  But look, let's talk about hypocrisy for a second, okay? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=781.34s)]
*  Uh-oh, here we go. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=784.02s)]
*  Let's talk about CNN's hypocrisy and the media's hypocrisy. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=785.26s)]
*  Because earlier in the week, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=788.62s)]
*  they were saying that any criticism of Yoel Roth, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=789.94s)]
*  who is Twitter's former head of trust and safety, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=793.8199999999999s)]
*  amounted to a threat to his safety. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=796.1s)]
*  And they had this theatrical tweet [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=798.62s)]
*  where they claimed he was having to flee his house, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=800.3s)]
*  which a lot of people found pretty preposterous. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=802.66s)]
*  They were basically saying that public criticism of someone [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=805.8199999999999s)]
*  who has put themselves out there [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=809.5s)]
*  to engage in a public debate, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=810.6999999999999s)]
*  who's writing op-eds for the New York Times, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=812.62s)]
*  that is a threat to safety. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=814.3s)]
*  However, publishing someone's real-time location [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=815.74s)]
*  on a continuous basis so they can be targeted [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=818.86s)]
*  is not a threat to safety. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=821.6999999999999s)]
*  It's not an intellectual consistent. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=822.8199999999999s)]
*  It's not a threat to safety. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=823.66s)]
*  That is not- I'm sorry. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=824.5s)]
*  If one of those two things is a threat to safety, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=825.3399999999999s)]
*  it's the real-time doxing of somebody. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=828.0999999999999s)]
*  I think we now understand why Elon did what he did. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=829.98s)]
*  He basically had an incident in LA [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=832.6999999999999s)]
*  in which the safety of his kid was threatened [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=834.9399999999999s)]
*  because he's got stalkers coming after him. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=836.9399999999999s)]
*  So his safety is a real issue. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=838.98s)]
*  It's not like a made-up issue. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=840.66s)]
*  But why should his personal experience [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=842.42s)]
*  affect the usage of the service [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=846.26s)]
*  that hundreds of millions of people use? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=848.2199999999999s)]
*  And that's the big issue. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=849.74s)]
*  The decision should not be based [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=850.8199999999999s)]
*  on what affects him personally. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=852.18s)]
*  There needs to be a principle basis. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=853.66s)]
*  There needs to be a principle basis [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=855.5s)]
*  for any decision about content moderation or censorship. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=856.9399999999999s)]
*  Maybe in the first few hours of that decision, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=860.06s)]
*  it wasn't handled perfectly [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=862.02s)]
*  because there wasn't a principle basis. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=863.1s)]
*  But since then, one has been put in place. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=864.62s)]
*  The principle basis is what J. Cal showed. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=867.3s)]
*  And this applies to everybody. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=869.4599999999999s)]
*  And so now it's a debate [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=871.42s)]
*  about whether that policy makes sense. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=873.18s)]
*  Now, is Elon just as arbitrary and capricious [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=875.06s)]
*  as the former executives [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=878.06s)]
*  who are running Trust and Safety at Twitter? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=880.46s)]
*  I don't think so for two reasons. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=882.38s)]
*  Number one, he's promised transparency. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=884.26s)]
*  He said that when we ban or shadow ban an account, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=886.34s)]
*  there has to be a reason for it. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=889.02s)]
*  And you have to be alerted to it. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=890.38s)]
*  In other words, none of the shadow stuff. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=891.62s)]
*  No shadow. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=893.74s)]
*  You get your speeding ticket, you get your ticket. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=894.5799999999999s)]
*  It's there, right. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=897.42s)]
*  No more shadow. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=898.46s)]
*  That is different. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=899.3s)]
*  And then the second thing is that, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=900.12s)]
*  and again, I think you could say [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=901.5799999999999s)]
*  they didn't do this perfectly in the first few hours, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=903.02s)]
*  but there needs to be a principle basis [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=905.22s)]
*  for a censorship decision. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=906.82s)]
*  And it needs to be applied to everyone equally. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=908.1400000000001s)]
*  And so far, we haven't seen any basis for believing [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=910.7s)]
*  that he's not applying this principle equally. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=912.74s)]
*  I mean, still very early. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=914.94s)]
*  Whereas the former rulers at Twitter [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=916.2800000000001s)]
*  were indulging their personal bias and personal preferences [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=918.58s)]
*  in who they were banning. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=921.6600000000001s)]
*  There were two standards of justice. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=922.6600000000001s)]
*  If you were someone who has allied with them, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=925.08s)]
*  it was almost impossible to get censored [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=927.0200000000001s)]
*  no matter how hateful your tweets were. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=929.5600000000001s)]
*  But if you were somebody on the other side [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=931.7800000000001s)]
*  of the political debate, they were eager to suppress you. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=933.1400000000001s)]
*  And I think that at least so far, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=935.98s)]
*  Elon has not shown that type of selectivity. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=937.74s)]
*  He selected against someone that put him at personal risk. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=940.98s)]
*  I think, yes. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=945.5s)]
*  But you understand what I'm saying. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=946.82s)]
*  Yeah, I do, I do. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=947.66s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=948.5s)]
*  I totally, yeah. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=949.34s)]
*  If that's where the decision had stayed, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=950.48s)]
*  then I would agree with you. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=952.94s)]
*  But I think that since then, they've put in place, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=954.14s)]
*  they've undergirded that decision [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=956.7s)]
*  with a principle policy. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=958.78s)]
*  I think those tweets streams are cool. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=959.98s)]
*  I think there's some cool tweets streams [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=963.1800000000001s)]
*  that some of these people run, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=965.2199999999999s)]
*  and there are hundreds of them, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=966.14s)]
*  and they're actually kind of cool. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=967.2199999999999s)]
*  You can see where these different planes. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=968.3s)]
*  You're in favor of people tracking people's planes. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=969.14s)]
*  Yeah, they show where Air Force One is. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=970.62s)]
*  They show all these different planes. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=972.4599999999999s)]
*  Look, and whether or not the FAA [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=973.8199999999999s)]
*  should be publishing this data is a separate question, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=975.18s)]
*  but it's on the open internet. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=977.26s)]
*  It is already there. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=978.78s)]
*  It's like turning off the RSS feed from the open internet [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=980.14s)]
*  to protect himself. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=983.3s)]
*  That's why it feels onerous. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=984.5799999999999s)]
*  So here's the part I agree with, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=985.7399999999999s)]
*  which is I think this policy with regard to planes [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=987.14s)]
*  specifically is gonna be futile. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=989.9599999999999s)]
*  It's gonna be at best harm reduction [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=992.66s)]
*  because as long as there's many ways [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=994.58s)]
*  to publish this information, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=996.0600000000001s)]
*  it's pointless to suppress on Twitter. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=996.9000000000001s)]
*  It's on Reddit, it's on Facebook. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=997.74s)]
*  So listen, I think this whole policy on Twitter [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=999.34s)]
*  is a little bit of a red herring. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1002.7800000000001s)]
*  I think the real issue, the real underlying issue [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1004.26s)]
*  is that the FAA is publishing these ICAL numbers, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1006.5s)]
*  thereby making every plane personally identifiable. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1009.5s)]
*  I don't think there's, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1011.9000000000001s)]
*  I haven't heard anyone explain why that's necessary. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1012.94s)]
*  I have a counter to it, actually, Sax, if I may. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1015.9000000000001s)]
*  What we saw, whether you agree with it or not, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1018.48s)]
*  with the mass banning of certain individuals [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1022.38s)]
*  did actually silence them [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1025.78s)]
*  and take them out of the public square. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1027.56s)]
*  One of the reasons, in fact, Elon wanted to buy Twitter. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1028.9s)]
*  So if you look at certain individuals, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1031.86s)]
*  whether it's Milo, Alex Jones, Trump himself, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1033.34s)]
*  right on down the line, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1036.38s)]
*  when they got banned across all systems, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1037.58s)]
*  it was dramatic in terms of the reach of that information. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1040.08s)]
*  So because of the size and scale [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1043.54s)]
*  of YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, et cetera, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1045.62s)]
*  when they act in coordination, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1047.96s)]
*  they can have a dramatic impact, not a perfect impact, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1050.46s)]
*  but a dramatic, which is why we have this issue of, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1053.78s)]
*  hey, should 230 be rethought? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1055.78s)]
*  Because when they act en masse, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1057.54s)]
*  it is extraordinary what they can do to an individual. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1059.26s)]
*  They took Alex Joe, how do you consume Alex Jones? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1062.74s)]
*  You have to seek that out in a major way. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1067.1000000000001s)]
*  It's distinctly different. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1068.82s)]
*  Chamath, last word, and then we're moving on [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1070.3s)]
*  to what could be the greatest science corner [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1072.66s)]
*  ever in the history of all in pod. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1075.8400000000001s)]
*  Final word, Chamath. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1077.5s)]
*  I think this is a great transition. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1079.22s)]
*  We're about to talk about nuclear fusion. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1081.18s)]
*  And my point is, I don't care about any of this stuff. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1082.8600000000001s)]
*  Like I said, this is my point is like, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1085.6200000000001s)]
*  if you take like an average person, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1089.66s)]
*  we are, let's say awake 16 hours a day. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1093.5s)]
*  And if you take out the time with our family, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1096.96s)]
*  David, the family is people that are related to you. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1100.5800000000002s)]
*  Can we DM sacks those people one more time? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1104.5800000000002s)]
*  We'll send you their names. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1107.54s)]
*  But if you take that out and you take out, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1109.26s)]
*  exercising and bathroom time. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1112.1s)]
*  Can we also explain that to sacks? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1114.1399999999999s)]
*  That's when you increase your heart rate and sweat sacks. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1115.62s)]
*  The point is that you have, let's just call it 12 hours, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1118.78s)]
*  a functional executive time that you can apply to a problem. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1122.5s)]
*  And you can break that down into these blocks, right? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1125.86s)]
*  I would really love what is basically the smartest human [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1129.94s)]
*  and the most productive human of our generation [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1133.8999999999999s)]
*  to be filling those blocks with things [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1137.06s)]
*  that sort of like really transcend. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1140.3s)]
*  And increasingly, and I agree that freedom of speech [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1143.62s)]
*  is important, increasingly those buckets are being filled [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1147.98s)]
*  with things that are very low level and hyper tactical [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1151.22s)]
*  and are distractions at best to the path of free speech. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1157.34s)]
*  And so I think that hopefully he gets all this shit [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1161.6399999999999s)]
*  under control over there. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1165.94s)]
*  He finds a good executive team. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1167.66s)]
*  I would like to see him get back to landing rockets [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1170.06s)]
*  on barges, getting to Mars. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1173.6200000000001s)]
*  Let's finish self driving. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1176.3400000000001s)]
*  We're almost there. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1179.3400000000001s)]
*  Chamath definitely has a point. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1180.38s)]
*  I would say one of the reasons why we don't care [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1181.74s)]
*  that much about this issue is because I think something [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1183.6200000000001s)]
*  to understand that's important is there are different kinds [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1187.54s)]
*  of speech and different kinds of speech [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1189.74s)]
*  deserve different levels of protection. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1191.02s)]
*  The fact of the matter is like business advertising [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1192.6200000000001s)]
*  is not as protected as political speech. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1194.66s)]
*  Porn is not as protected as political speech. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1196.5800000000002s)]
*  Political speech, speech criticizing the people in power [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1198.8600000000001s)]
*  is the most protected category of speech [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1201.8200000000002s)]
*  because the founders of the country understood [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1203.6200000000001s)]
*  that the people in power will always try [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1206.22s)]
*  to insulate themselves from accountability [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1208.68s)]
*  by limiting that kind of speech. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1210.8200000000002s)]
*  But that is precisely the kind of speech [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1212.3400000000001s)]
*  that the former rulers of Twitter suppressed the most [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1214.14s)]
*  and showed the least sensitivity to. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1217.14s)]
*  So listen, I mean, is Elon gonna be [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1219.3400000000001s)]
*  the perfect content moderator? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1221.0600000000002s)]
*  No, I mean. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1222.3000000000002s)]
*  Nobody is. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1223.54s)]
*  Nobody is. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1224.38s)]
*  But I do not believe that puts him in the same category [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1225.22s)]
*  as Vijay Agarwadi or Yoel Roth [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1229.26s)]
*  who showed no sensitivity for political speech. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1232.7s)]
*  He has indicated a desire to restore freedom of speech [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1235.3s)]
*  and I think they ultimately ended up in a good place [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1237.98s)]
*  on this docks marlcy. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1240.62s)]
*  I want him to get us to Mars. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1242.22s)]
*  I don't care about Ben and Twitter handles. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1243.26s)]
*  Let's move on to the best science corner ever. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1244.98s)]
*  So according to sources, scientists worked [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1247.98s)]
*  for the US government have achieved a net energy gain [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1250.82s)]
*  in a fusion reaction for the first time. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1253.54s)]
*  No, no, not net energy gain. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1255.78s)]
*  Get it right. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1256.78s)]
*  We had ignition energy, which is very different [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1258.22s)]
*  from net energy gain. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1260.3799999999999s)]
*  Okay, hold on. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1261.22s)]
*  I know that you're in the anti-camp. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1262.06s)]
*  Please let the science nerd have his moment. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1263.3s)]
*  You have to say it correctly [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1265.82s)]
*  so that people understand what you're talking about. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1267.02s)]
*  Let me just make it even simpler then. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1269.1399999999999s)]
*  Explain to us what fusion is, Dr. Friedberg, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1271.18s)]
*  and explain to us why this could potentially [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1274.58s)]
*  change everything. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1276.86s)]
*  We did this on a show once before, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1277.7s)]
*  but I'll kind of do a quick kind of summary again. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1280.34s)]
*  Basically, if you take atomic nuclei, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1284.4599999999998s)]
*  which are made of protons and neutrons [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1286.4199999999998s)]
*  and they repel one another, right? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1288.9399999999998s)]
*  Because protons are positively charged. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1290.98s)]
*  So they want to push apart from each other. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1293.26s)]
*  So with enough energy and enough density, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1295.54s)]
*  meaning that they're moving fast enough [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1297.54s)]
*  and they're close enough, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1298.8999999999999s)]
*  they'll overcome their repulsion and jam into each other. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1300.1799999999998s)]
*  When that happens, some energy is released [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1303.22s)]
*  because the total mass of the fusion of those nuclei [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1305.78s)]
*  is actually less than those nuclei [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1310.62s)]
*  when they're on their own. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1312.98s)]
*  And so some energy is released [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1314.1399999999999s)]
*  and that energy drives a chain reaction. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1315.78s)]
*  And so fusion is this concept [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1320.34s)]
*  that is fundamental to physics [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1322.86s)]
*  and fundamental to the energy driver of our universe. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1326.06s)]
*  So the star in our sky, the sun, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1328.26s)]
*  is driven by fusion. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1333.26s)]
*  And only about 15% of the mass of the sun at the center [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1334.98s)]
*  is dense enough to actually drive fusion. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1338.9s)]
*  So the big challenge with fusion [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1341.34s)]
*  is how do you get these atomic nuclei close enough together [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1343.22s)]
*  and moving fast enough [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1347.46s)]
*  that they'll actually fuse and release energy? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1349.06s)]
*  And that's super hard. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1351.34s)]
*  The reason it happens in the sun [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1352.22s)]
*  is because the sun has so much mass [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1354.18s)]
*  that the gravity pulls all those particles together. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1356.6200000000001s)]
*  They get close enough, they get hot enough, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1359.6200000000001s)]
*  they move fast enough and fusion happens. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1361.06s)]
*  Boom, all this energy comes out and every day we're warm. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1362.98s)]
*  Now, to do it on earth is very difficult, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1365.9s)]
*  but if we can do it, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1368.94s)]
*  what happens when you fuse nuclei together [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1370.26s)]
*  is you don't release any, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1372.26s)]
*  this isn't like a radioactive fission reaction. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1373.98s)]
*  You release energy that can be harnessed [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1378.14s)]
*  to drive our systems, our technology. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1379.94s)]
*  How is it done? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1382.38s)]
*  Yeah, so in the 1950s, this was theorized, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1383.22s)]
*  hey, we could do fusion on earth. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1385.98s)]
*  We gotta get a really, really dense plasma, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1387.42s)]
*  meaning the atomic nuclei and the electrons [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1389.7s)]
*  have kind of gone off the atoms [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1391.82s)]
*  and it's just the nuclei spinning apart. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1393.62s)]
*  You gotta get them to move super fast, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1394.98s)]
*  like tens of millions of degrees Celsius [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1396.7s)]
*  and you gotta get them really close together. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1399.06s)]
*  So how the heck can you do this? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1400.8999999999999s)]
*  So there's a couple of concepts to do this, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1402.62s)]
*  one of which is called inertial confinement, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1405.62s)]
*  which is where you basically create a little pellet [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1408.26s)]
*  of the material you're gonna try and get to fuse [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1410.6599999999999s)]
*  and you put a ton of energy on the outside [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1415.06s)]
*  and you compress it really hard, really fast. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1416.9399999999998s)]
*  And when you compress it really hard, really fast [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1419.6599999999999s)]
*  and you can get it to be done in a perfect sphere [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1421.3s)]
*  and you can get it to collapse on itself very quickly [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1424.1s)]
*  without kind of shooting all over the place, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1426.94s)]
*  enough of those particles will come close enough together, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1429.34s)]
*  fast enough, hot enough, and they will start to fuse. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1431.62s)]
*  Another way is through magnetic confinement, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1434.3s)]
*  where you use magnetic fields to create a really hot plasma, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1437.1399999999999s)]
*  get it to spin around or to move, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1440.78s)]
*  and then the magnet brings that super hot plasma [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1442.54s)]
*  closer and closer and closer together [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1445.06s)]
*  until all those particles are moving fast [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1446.8999999999999s)]
*  and they're dense enough that they start to fuse. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1449.06s)]
*  One is called magnetic confinement, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1451.94s)]
*  the other one's inertial confinement. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1453.5s)]
*  And so what we saw happen this week [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1455.26s)]
*  is at the National Ignition Facility, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1457.5800000000002s)]
*  which is a facility that was built starting in 1997, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1459.66s)]
*  and they've spent about three and a half billion dollars [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1463.5s)]
*  to date, they demonstrated a net energy output [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1465.6200000000001s)]
*  from the fusion reaction of an inertial confinement system. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1468.98s)]
*  And what that means is they took a little pellet [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1472.38s)]
*  and that pellet was made up of deuterium and tritium. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1474.6200000000001s)]
*  The atomic nuclei that they use, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1477.98s)]
*  the particles that they use are deuterium, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1479.98s)]
*  which is a proton and a neutron stuck together, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1482.42s)]
*  and then tritium, which is a proton [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1484.9s)]
*  and two neutrons stuck together. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1486.82s)]
*  And the reason they use those two combinations [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1488.46s)]
*  is of all the different ways you could fuse nuclei together, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1490.78s)]
*  this has the best energy output of any kind of reaction. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1495.18s)]
*  Freiburg, what actually happened this time [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1498.18s)]
*  that made this work for what, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1500.94s)]
*  apparently only three billion dollars you said, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1503.58s)]
*  you didn't say three trillion, you said three billion. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1505.66s)]
*  Three and a half billion. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1507.22s)]
*  About a third of what Sam Bankman fraud stole. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1508.58s)]
*  We have done something here, allegedly. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1511.74s)]
*  So what actually happened that is so dramatic [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1514.54s)]
*  that we have a press conference [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1517.4199999999998s)]
*  and everybody's losing their mind? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1518.54s)]
*  So yeah, I just wanna highlight one more thing [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1520.06s)]
*  about why this is so hard. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1521.74s)]
*  You have to get such an incredible density, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1523.58s)]
*  you have to get incredible energy, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1526.4199999999998s)]
*  so high temperature and high density [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1528.3799999999999s)]
*  that confining those atoms and not letting them escape [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1530.94s)]
*  and basically dissolve before they fuse is super difficult. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1534.98s)]
*  It requires so much energy in such a controlled way, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1540.38s)]
*  in such a perfect and precise way [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1543.3400000000001s)]
*  that all of the digital technology, the magnets, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1545.8600000000001s)]
*  all the measurement systems, all the software, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1548.78s)]
*  it's taken us decades to get everything [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1551.38s)]
*  that allows us to do this today. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1553.5400000000002s)]
*  And now we're at the point that we may be able [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1556.22s)]
*  to start to realize production scale versions of this. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1558.18s)]
*  So what they did is they had a small deuterium [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1562.54s)]
*  and tritium pellet and they shown 192 lasers [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1565.22s)]
*  onto this container that held that little fuel. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1568.82s)]
*  Those 192 lasers, the whole thing happened [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1571.78s)]
*  in a billionth of a second, the laser is pulsed, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1574.5s)]
*  boom, here's an image of it. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1577.26s)]
*  And as they did that, they basically X-rays [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1579.1s)]
*  kind of hit the sphere, this little BB, if you will, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1582.42s)]
*  BB kind of thing and compressed it. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1586.22s)]
*  And it compressed so quickly and with such heat [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1588.26s)]
*  and it didn't dissipate because it was done so precisely, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1590.86s)]
*  all the lasers hit at the exact right time, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1593.58s)]
*  boom, this thing compressed and then energy came out [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1596.4599999999998s)]
*  and the energy that came out that was measured [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1599.1399999999999s)]
*  was one and a half times the energy [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1601.1799999999998s)]
*  that kind of went into that reaction. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1602.6999999999998s)]
*  And here's a chart that I'll show you [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1604.8999999999999s)]
*  from the National Ignition Facility, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1606.4599999999998s)]
*  which shows just how inefficient the system still is. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1607.86s)]
*  And this isn't even speaking to Chamov's point, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1611.8999999999999s)]
*  but basically these guys lose 90% of the energy [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1615.34s)]
*  that they put into the center of the system. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1620.26s)]
*  Only 10% is actually used to drive the compression, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1623.14s)]
*  the rest of it is lost and there's a lot of ways [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1626.18s)]
*  to improve the efficiency of the system from here. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1628.22s)]
*  But basically they put two megajoules in, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1631.18s)]
*  they got three megajoules out. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1633.5s)]
*  And so it was the first proof point, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1635.5s)]
*  production proof point in the 70 years [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1638.22s)]
*  that we've been theorizing about nuclear fusion [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1640.54s)]
*  here on planet Earth that this is possible and it's real. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1642.74s)]
*  Now, this is these kind of inertial confinement systems. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1645.9s)]
*  There are 33 private technology companies today [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1649.38s)]
*  that have raised about three to $4 billion so far this year [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1653.5400000000002s)]
*  to pursue several other technologies [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1658.38s)]
*  besides what the National Ignition Facility is showing [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1660.8600000000001s)]
*  to try and build production ready versions [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1663.42s)]
*  of nuclear fusion. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1666.14s)]
*  And so these 33 companies are using [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1667.8200000000002s)]
*  a bunch of different types of tools, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1669.7s)]
*  one of which is the Tokamak. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1671.5s)]
*  If you show the image, I'll show you this one. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1672.7800000000002s)]
*  There it is. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1674.38s)]
*  Yeah, Tokamak, this is what we talked about. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1675.2s)]
*  That is the magnetic spinning thing [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1676.46s)]
*  that looks like Iron Man's arc reactor, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1679.1000000000001s)]
*  which I think they based it on. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1682.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you create a plasma, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1684.1000000000001s)]
*  you basically speed up the hydrogen nuclei super, super fast, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1685.42s)]
*  these deuterium and tritium nuclei super, super fast. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1688.78s)]
*  And then you use magnets and the magnetic field [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1692.02s)]
*  has to precisely squeeze the plasma, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1694.3s)]
*  squeezing it, squeezing it, squeezing it. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1697.3400000000001s)]
*  And if it's slightly off in even the tiniest way, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1698.66s)]
*  think about a balloon, right? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1701.8200000000002s)]
*  If you put a pinhole in a balloon, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1703.3s)]
*  everything escapes from the balloon. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1704.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta do a perfect one. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1706.22s)]
*  That's how technically hard this is. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1707.5s)]
*  You're basically trying to create a balloon [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1709.46s)]
*  with a magnetic field and you're trying to keep the gas [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1711.78s)]
*  and you're trying to make it smaller [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1714.54s)]
*  and smaller and smaller. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1715.62s)]
*  And if any tiny hole emerges, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1716.46s)]
*  the entire plasma shoots out of it. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1718.02s)]
*  Is that what happens in Uranus? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1720.1s)]
*  Like when you're trying to hold in the Wagyu, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1722.7s)]
*  anyway, let me ask this question then [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1725.94s)]
*  about the consistency of this. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1729.54s)]
*  And then we'll go to you Chamath. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1732.26s)]
*  Can they do it consistently? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1734.22s)]
*  Or do you think this is like they got lucky once [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1735.94s)]
*  or are we gonna be sitting here a year from now [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1738.8600000000001s)]
*  and they're like we put in two and we got out six [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1740.94s)]
*  and we did it five times. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1743.22s)]
*  Yeah, so now we've proven that humans can do this. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1744.5800000000002s)]
*  Okay, which is, look, I mean, I wanna give you guys some, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1747.66s)]
*  and I know kind of some of Chamath's concerns, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1750.8600000000001s)]
*  which is how production- [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1753.06s)]
*  Humans can recreate the sun is what this comes down to. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1753.9s)]
*  No, no. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1756.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but guys, I wanna just say one, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1757.46s)]
*  like, even close. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1759.74s)]
*  I wanna say one important thing from a historical context. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1761.8600000000001s)]
*  All breakthrough technology starts out [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1766.62s)]
*  seeming impossibly large, impossibly expensive, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1769.3799999999999s)]
*  and impossibly slow. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1773.1s)]
*  The Human Genome Project 20 years ago [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1774.74s)]
*  cost $100 million to sequence the human genome. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1776.98s)]
*  Today we can do it in a couple of minutes for $100. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1779.8999999999999s)]
*  Okay? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1783.7s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1784.54s)]
*  The first computer, the ENIAC computer [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1785.3799999999999s)]
*  had 500 flops of compute capacity. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1786.78s)]
*  It filled a room. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1789.5s)]
*  It cost $8 million to build. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1790.74s)]
*  20 years later, we had a mainframe. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1792.78s)]
*  20 years later, we had a PC. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1794.66s)]
*  No, this is all this emotional bullshit. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1796.14s)]
*  You're using the wrong examples. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1798.1000000000001s)]
*  Okay, let him finish, then you go, Chamath. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1799.8600000000001s)]
*  Good, finish your sentence, Freberg, and then we go. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1801.3400000000001s)]
*  And today we have an iPhone that can do [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1803.3400000000001s)]
*  two trillion flops of compute in your pocket. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1805.46s)]
*  I think that what we're seeing with Fusion today [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1809.0600000000002s)]
*  is similar to what we saw with the ENIAC computer [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1811.8200000000002s)]
*  in the 1950s, which is the demonstration [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1813.74s)]
*  that compute is possible, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1816.18s)]
*  and now we're seeing a demonstration [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1817.9s)]
*  that Fusion is possible. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1819.3000000000002s)]
*  And a lot of folks have anticipated this moment, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1820.94s)]
*  and they've invested ahead of this. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1823.6599999999999s)]
*  Now, I don't know if any of these companies [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1825.1399999999999s)]
*  that are currently kind of being built [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1826.78s)]
*  are gonna be production ready anytime soon. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1828.3799999999999s)]
*  My estimate is that we will see production demonstration [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1830.34s)]
*  of Fusion in the 2030s. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1834.34s)]
*  So call it eight years from now plus, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1838.02s)]
*  and then you'll see grid scale scale up in the 2040s. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1840.1799999999998s)]
*  So this isn't something that's gonna happen [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1843.34s)]
*  next year or two years from now. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1844.86s)]
*  If it's already happening, what are you talking about? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1845.6999999999998s)]
*  Okay, now, Chamath, your rebuttal. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1847.9799999999998s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1849.9399999999998s)]
*  Knowing you're a huge fan of solar. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1850.78s)]
*  This is the most navel gazing, head up your ass [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1852.38s)]
*  scientific bullshit I've ever heard. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1854.98s)]
*  Okay, well. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1856.66s)]
*  Couple points. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1857.5s)]
*  Let's start with the basics. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1858.3400000000001s)]
*  The first is that there was no previous technical analog. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1859.7s)]
*  Why are you being, why are you angry at me? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1863.38s)]
*  I'm not angry. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1866.2600000000002s)]
*  I find this so tiring hearing this. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1867.1000000000001s)]
*  It's all syrupy nonsense. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1869.46s)]
*  You seem a little triggered. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1870.3000000000002s)]
*  He's right. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1871.5s)]
*  Yeah, why are you so angry? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1872.3400000000001s)]
*  Like, I don't get it. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1873.18s)]
*  A little chippy. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1874.0200000000002s)]
*  Because I don't find this intellectually honest. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1874.8600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1876.66s)]
*  Explain why, but let's keep the emotions. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1877.5s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1880.3400000000001s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1881.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1883.62s)]
*  When you talk about sequencing the genome, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1884.5s)]
*  there was no alternative. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1886.9s)]
*  So you're right. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1888.46s)]
*  It was an enormous technical leap forward. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1889.3s)]
*  When we built a computer, there was no analog. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1892.5s)]
*  It was an enormous technical leap. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1895.9s)]
*  And so you're right. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1898.26s)]
*  We have a cost curve we don't understand, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1899.1s)]
*  and then we iterate as rapidly as possible [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1902.02s)]
*  and all these innovations where we built [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1904.3799999999999s)]
*  an entire infrastructure to ride down the cost curve. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1905.98s)]
*  The thing is, fusion energy exists today. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1909.38s)]
*  It's called the sun. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1914.0600000000002s)]
*  We actually know how to capture it [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1915.3000000000002s)]
*  at virtually no cost right now. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1917.2600000000002s)]
*  So according to the IAEA, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1919.5800000000002s)]
*  today you can capture grid level solar energy [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1921.7s)]
*  for about three cents a kilowatt hour. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1924.94s)]
*  That's as close to zero as we've ever been. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1927.46s)]
*  And over the next 10 years, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1930.1000000000001s)]
*  their forecast is it's gonna get to one and a half cents. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1931.5s)]
*  If you then wanna store it and you layer in storage costs, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1934.7s)]
*  we'll be at a whopping three cents a kilowatt hour. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1938.58s)]
*  That's where we are today. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1941.98s)]
*  And so I think that fusion does exist. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1944.78s)]
*  I do think that this is an incredible technical leap [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1948.3s)]
*  to replicate something that exists. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1951.9399999999998s)]
*  And I think that's where the intellectual dishonesty is. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1954.02s)]
*  It does exist. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1956.62s)]
*  It has been captured. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1958.46s)]
*  It can be harnessed. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1960.06s)]
*  And there is a positive energy equation [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1961.78s)]
*  just in a different modality that doesn't speak [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1964.3799999999999s)]
*  to these technically minded individuals. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1966.86s)]
*  A couple of other points about what I saw. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1968.62s)]
*  I think it's incredible what happened, okay? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1970.74s)]
*  But just to make sure we're clear, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1972.9399999999998s)]
*  this is 192 lasers, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1975.3799999999999s)]
*  the size of three football fields [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1978.86s)]
*  that consume 322 megajoules of energy, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1982.1s)]
*  which then ultimately deliver two megajoules to a target, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1985.5s)]
*  which then release three. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1988.58s)]
*  So this is why I'm saying we had positive [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1989.4599999999998s)]
*  what's called ignition energy. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1991.3799999999999s)]
*  We did not have positive electrical energy captured. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1992.5s)]
*  So yeah, could we figure this out? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1995.34s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1997.74s)]
*  Can we then shrink the three football fields [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=1998.6599999999999s)]
*  down to something that looks the size of a laptop? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2001.26s)]
*  We possibly could. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2004.62s)]
*  Will it take 20 or 30 years? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2005.8999999999999s)]
*  Possibly. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2007.74s)]
*  But in the meanwhile, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2008.58s)]
*  if the goal is unlimited costless energy, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2009.5s)]
*  you're on that cost curve already. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2012.86s)]
*  Yeah, but why can't it be both? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2015.02s)]
*  So you said I was being intellectually dishonest. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2016.22s)]
*  What was I intellectually dishonest about? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2018.4599999999998s)]
*  Where's the dishonest? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2019.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2020.1399999999999s)]
*  You're comparing this. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2020.98s)]
*  What you're saying is right. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2022.82s)]
*  Yes, you can get- [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2023.6599999999999s)]
*  It seemed to be an agreement. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2024.54s)]
*  Industrial stable, yeah. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2025.34s)]
*  I just think that you're trying to say [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2026.7s)]
*  that this is an entirely new thing. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2029.18s)]
*  No, it's a different approach [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2031.02s)]
*  to a thing we've already beaten and basically captured. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2033.02s)]
*  Let me bring- [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2037.3s)]
*  What I would argue, Chamath, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2038.14s)]
*  and I think this is important, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2039.5s)]
*  the net energy you can capture on, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2040.9s)]
*  say a football field sized facility from solar, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2043.38s)]
*  is a tiny fraction of the energy you could generate [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2046.5s)]
*  from a football field sized fusion reactor. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2050.02s)]
*  And that's why the argument would be like, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2052.62s)]
*  when we were developing computers, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2055.1400000000003s)]
*  hey, we have abacuses, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2056.6600000000003s)]
*  we shouldn't be developing computers. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2057.78s)]
*  And I think that's the analogy I would use here. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2059.3s)]
*  This is why the cost per kilowatt hour [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2061.42s)]
*  is what the levelized cost of energy tries to do. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2064.1000000000004s)]
*  It tries to normalize that argument away, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2067.82s)]
*  because everybody would say that, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2071.3s)]
*  hey, hold on a second, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2072.98s)]
*  you're gonna need planefuls of this or boatloads of that. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2074.0600000000004s)]
*  And people said, no, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2077.3s)]
*  what's the levelized cost of energy? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2078.1400000000003s)]
*  What is the cost per kilowatt hour to generate energy? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2080.98s)]
*  And what I'm saying is, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2084.2200000000003s)]
*  that is an absolute scale, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2085.6200000000003s)]
*  and free is zero, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2087.94s)]
*  and we're at 1.5 cents off. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2089.54s)]
*  Here's what I would say, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2091.6200000000003s)]
*  Jake, I want to say, Chamath, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2092.46s)]
*  the opportunity here is not necessarily [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2094.7000000000003s)]
*  about cost reduction, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2097.06s)]
*  it is about scalability. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2098.02s)]
*  And if hydrogen is abundant, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2099.86s)]
*  which it is on this planet, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2101.78s)]
*  it is nearly infinitely abundant. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2103.26s)]
*  We can take that hydrogen, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2105.34s)]
*  and we can scale up energy and electricity production [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2106.9s)]
*  in a way that is unimaginable compared to solar. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2109.6600000000003s)]
*  And I don't think that solar should be excluded. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2112.34s)]
*  Solar is key today and should be scaled up, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2114.5800000000004s)]
*  and I'm 100% in agreement with you. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2117.1800000000003s)]
*  But the scalability to go 100X, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2118.9s)]
*  if we want to make 100 times more electricity, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2120.9s)]
*  I think we need fusion, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2123.86s)]
*  and I think that it's feasible. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2124.9s)]
*  So I think we have reached a good settlement here. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2126.42s)]
*  Chamath, you're saying, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2130.54s)]
*  hey, listen, we're getting solar down so cheap, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2131.6600000000003s)]
*  we can solve this problem. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2133.98s)]
*  Not solar, all forms of energy. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2134.82s)]
*  Okay, great, we are solving that. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2136.0600000000004s)]
*  So for our needs today, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2137.6600000000003s)]
*  and then what Freeberg is saying, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2139.2200000000003s)]
*  but what if you had unlimited, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2141.06s)]
*  a thing that we can't even imagine, beautiful. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2143.7s)]
*  Now, watch as I get Sax involved in a science conversation. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2145.58s)]
*  He has zero interest in. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2150.02s)]
*  Mr. David Sax, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2153.18s)]
*  if in fact there was 100% more free electricity available [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2155.1s)]
*  in this timeframe, the next 10 to 20. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2159.98s)]
*  100X, 100X. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2161.62s)]
*  100X, the available energy. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2162.62s)]
*  In other words, supply of energy just becomes flooded, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2164.42s)]
*  and it's free essentially. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2168.74s)]
*  What would be the geopolitical reaction on planet earth [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2170.26s)]
*  in terms of this incredible rivalry we have with China [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2174.5400000000004s)]

*  No, stop. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2208.3s)]
*  Can I just say, can I just say? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2209.14s)]
*  Jay Kal, I'll call your intellectual dishonesty [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2210.98s)]
*  and raise you a steel man. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2213.38s)]
*  Go ahead, go ahead. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2214.78s)]
*  I love you. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2217.26s)]
*  I love you, Sax, you know I do. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2218.34s)]
*  Sax and I had a great night out, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2220.5s)]
*  a Sunday night, woo, let's fuck later. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2221.98s)]
*  I just wanna be very clear. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2225.7400000000002s)]
*  So, I need to get drunk together. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2226.58s)]
*  That's why you call me petty too. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2227.66s)]
*  I think we're running out of time. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2228.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, here's what I wanna be clear. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2229.66s)]
*  I think that- [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2230.7s)]
*  I'm just glad that you guys are fighting, not me and Sax. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2232.06s)]
*  Guys, please, let me finish. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2234.3399999999997s)]
*  Okay, let me finish. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2235.62s)]
*  I think that this breakthrough is really valuable. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2236.46s)]
*  I think it's interesting to see that these kinds [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2238.66s)]
*  of scientific breakthroughs continue to happen [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2240.46s)]
*  in government sponsored facilities and not private companies. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2243.02s)]
*  And I think that that's probably where a lot [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2246.5s)]
*  of these innovations will continue to come from [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2248.62s)]
*  because look at the scale of what had to be built. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2250.7s)]
*  Three football fields and 322 megajoules of energy [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2252.98s)]
*  and 192 lasers. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2256.38s)]
*  This is really complicated, expensive stuff. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2257.86s)]
*  I'm an enormous fan of these kinds [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2260.1400000000003s)]
*  of scientific breakthroughs. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2261.7400000000002s)]
*  I wanna be clear. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2262.62s)]
*  I think that where I struggle is translating this [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2263.98s)]
*  into actually an investible area. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2268.7400000000002s)]
*  And I worry that this is going to consume lots of money [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2271.6600000000003s)]
*  by folks that could otherwise put money to work [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2276.02s)]
*  in things that will actually pull forward [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2279.26s)]
*  our energy independence and energy abundance [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2281.3s)]
*  sooner and faster. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2283.38s)]
*  So for example, there are all kinds of things [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2284.34s)]
*  that we could do to secondary, ternary, third, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2287.54s)]
*  and fourth and fifth generation batteries [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2291.2200000000003s)]
*  that aren't happening today. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2292.86s)]
*  There are a bunch of things that we could do [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2294.5s)]
*  to actually create an infrastructure of green hydrogen. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2296.2200000000003s)]
*  And the simplistic answer is we could do it all. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2298.7000000000003s)]
*  But the reality is money is finite and we can't. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2302.06s)]
*  And all I'm observing is I do think [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2305.38s)]
*  that more practical things that do have geopolitical [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2307.7400000000002s)]
*  ramifications sooner are not gonna get funded [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2310.2200000000003s)]
*  because people do get enraptured by this. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2314.14s)]
*  And my skepticism is that this is still in the realm [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2315.98s)]
*  of government sponsored research [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2320.7799999999997s)]
*  and is not really an area [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2323.42s)]
*  that for-profit private companies can tackle. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2325.5s)]
*  And so I would rather those for-profit companies, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2327.9s)]
*  for example, Y Combinator just today, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2329.8199999999997s)]
*  put out something where they were a call to action [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2332.58s)]
*  or request for startups in climate. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2334.94s)]
*  And when you look at that list, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2337.18s)]
*  those are really practical investible areas. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2338.54s)]
*  And I just wanna make sure that the capital allocators [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2340.9s)]
*  that listen to this weigh those equally. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2343.34s)]
*  I am glad that the US government did this. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2346.5800000000004s)]
*  I hope they do more of this. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2349.54s)]
*  But if you're asking me, quite honestly, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2351.46s)]
*  I would rather the next $10 billion [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2353.3s)]
*  go into energy efficiency HVAC than fusion [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2355.6200000000003s)]
*  because A, fusion exists and B, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2359.0600000000004s)]
*  I think it's gonna happen at an innovative bench scale level [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2361.78s)]
*  by the government and not by a private company. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2366.1800000000003s)]
*  Let me just respond to that real quick. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2369.0600000000004s)]
*  Tomaz, I think that the idea of allocating our resources [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2371.02s)]
*  as a society should be done on a portfolio basis. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2375.1s)]
*  80% on the pragmatic near term, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2380.18s)]
*  15% on the next gen and 5% on the moonshot. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2382.78s)]
*  And this maybe starts to shift from the 5% to the 15%, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2386.66s)]
*  maybe it's still in the 5%. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2390.34s)]
*  But I don't see overfunding happening. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2392.02s)]
*  So I'll tell you guys, there was a survey done. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2394.66s)]
*  There's 33 private companies in fusion [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2396.2599999999998s)]
*  that are fusion companies today. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2398.7s)]
*  And the biggest one is VC back, eight new this year. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2401.7000000000003s)]
*  So the number has kind of increased by 33% this year. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2405.54s)]
*  And so far this year, those companies have raised [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2408.78s)]
*  around three to $4 billion. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2411.54s)]
*  Which by the way is a fraction of what was done [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2413.02s)]
*  by 15 minute delivery companies for convenience stores. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2416.58s)]
*  Exactly my point. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2419.2200000000003s)]
*  And by the way, the biggest funding is happening in ITER, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2420.34s)]
*  which is the largest construction project in Europe. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2423.7400000000002s)]
*  And this is a $30 billion production scale [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2426.1s)]
*  by the end of the 2020s. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2429.5s)]
*  Government sponsored. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2430.58s)]
*  Government sponsored, yeah. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2431.74s)]
*  And so to your point. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2432.58s)]
*  This is my point. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2433.42s)]
*  I am a huge fan of government sponsored research. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2434.26s)]
*  Now we get finally the first science corner. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2435.98s)]
*  Everybody brace themselves. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2439.42s)]
*  It's the first science corner [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2440.66s)]
*  where David Sachs has an opinion. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2442.46s)]
*  Pop the cherry Sachs. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2443.86s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2444.7s)]
*  Come on, you can do it. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2445.54s)]
*  You can do it. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2446.38s)]
*  Mr. David Sachs, your thoughts on this. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2447.22s)]
*  Your question was a little bit, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2449.58s)]
*  was not a very hard question. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2451.9s)]
*  Let me rephrase, okay. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2453.22s)]
*  Hold on, I'm coming in. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2454.06s)]
*  What's the geopolitical impact if this does happen? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2454.88s)]
*  100X energy is available. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2456.66s)]
*  Obviously it's fantastic for the United States [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2457.66s)]
*  if it actually happens. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2459.38s)]
*  And the reason is, if you look across the world, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2460.42s)]
*  there's this thing in politics known as resource curse [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2462.92s)]
*  where the worst governments, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2467.42s)]
*  the most despotic governments tend to be in the countries [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2469.06s)]
*  that have the biggest natural resources, ironically. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2472.38s)]
*  So the countries that have huge amounts of petroleum [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2476.4s)]
*  or other kinds of minerals, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2480.14s)]
*  they've tend to have pretty corrupt governments. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2481.7s)]
*  And the reason for that is that if you're sitting on [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2485.46s)]
*  a giant oil reserve, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2488.86s)]
*  you don't need to make anything else work. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2490.26s)]
*  You just fight over who gets to control that oil reserve. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2491.78s)]
*  And that's what politics ends up being. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2494.7s)]
*  You don't need to create policies that foster innovation [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2496.44s)]
*  or attract knowledge workers, right? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2500.78s)]
*  You just basically mine that oil. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2502.58s)]
*  So if all of a sudden you're talking about [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2505.2200000000003s)]
*  turning energy into a software problem [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2507.3s)]
*  or an innovation problem [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2510.7400000000002s)]
*  that looks a lot more like the software industry, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2512.5s)]
*  that's an area where the United States [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2515.8199999999997s)]
*  has a huge advantage. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2516.66s)]
*  And yeah, I think it would pull the rug out [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2517.8199999999997s)]
*  from under many countries all over the world [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2519.6s)]
*  in favor of the United States. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2522.1s)]
*  I mean, it's a big if, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2524.3799999999997s)]

*  We'll be in there. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2825.1s)]
*  We'll be vacationing together next week. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2825.9399999999996s)]
*  So we'll- [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2828.22s)]
*  I love Friedberg. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2829.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2830.4599999999996s)]
*  Well, we are going to be- [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2831.2999999999997s)]
*  Whatever's going on, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2833.3399999999997s)]
*  we'll take a walk and figure it out. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2834.18s)]
*  Well, I just want to say the alliances amongst the besties. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2835.4199999999996s)]
*  People- [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2838.06s)]
*  I'll be honest. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2838.8999999999996s)]
*  I got mad at Friedberg when he edited that Google bit [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2839.74s)]
*  to say the exact opposite of what he actually said. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2842.74s)]
*  That you felt dishonest and disingenuous. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2844.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, just beep that. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2847.2599999999998s)]
*  That is the thing that bothered me. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2848.46s)]
*  I have to be honest. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2850.18s)]
*  That's you playing to the crowd [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2851.02s)]
*  versus you being honest and telling what you think. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2852.62s)]
*  Friedberg, can I, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2855.02s)]
*  let me put that in the form of a question. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2856.7799999999997s)]
*  Friedberg has your fame as the Sultan of Science, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2858.5s)]
*  because listen, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2861.94s)]
*  nobody knew who you were outside of Silicon Valley [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2862.9s)]
*  before this. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2864.7400000000002s)]
*  Has it impacted your ability to speak? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2865.58s)]
*  No, no, no, not my fame. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2867.94s)]
*  Look, I'll be honest. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2869.02s)]
*  And I'll speak openly about this. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2872.42s)]
*  I had said that there could probably be [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2873.82s)]
*  a significant head count reduction of like 75% at Google [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2875.34s)]
*  and the business could keep operating. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2879.98s)]
*  And I took it out. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2882.3s)]
*  And I took it out because I have a lot of friends [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2883.7400000000002s)]
*  that work at Google. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2885.82s)]
*  Google's a close partner of mine. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2886.98s)]
*  They're an investor of mine. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2888.9s)]
*  And frankly, I just wanna be careful about that. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2890.5s)]
*  It's not something I commonly do. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2893.18s)]
*  As you guys know, I usually speak my mind pretty clearly, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2895.14s)]
*  but I was just trying to be respectful. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2897.02s)]
*  And that's the reason I did it. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2898.58s)]
*  So now it's in. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2900.02s)]
*  I think that that was fine. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2900.86s)]
*  What I'm saying is not that. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2901.98s)]
*  It's just that the part that you edited in [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2903.22s)]
*  actually made it seem like you were not saying that at all, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2906.98s)]
*  but the opposite. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2909.34s)]
*  I think if you had cut the whole thing, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2910.18s)]
*  it would have been more honest. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2912.02s)]
*  So to keep that other thing in [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2913.46s)]
*  actually led the perception of the opposite. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2914.94s)]
*  So you were triggered by that. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2917.86s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2919.74s)]
*  I'm not triggered. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2920.58s)]
*  I'm saying I think we should have a principle. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2921.4199999999996s)]
*  Hold on, guys. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2922.66s)]
*  Hold on, guys. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2923.5s)]
*  You're like, yeah. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2924.3399999999997s)]
*  I know. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2925.18s)]
*  I think that we should just have a principle [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2926.02s)]
*  to not play to what the perception of what we say should be, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2928.22s)]
*  especially if it means we could be saying [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2931.2599999999998s)]
*  the opposite of what we actually mean. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2933.3799999999997s)]
*  That's all. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2934.8999999999996s)]
*  Intellectual honesty. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2935.7799999999997s)]
*  Is a bestie. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2937.14s)]
*  I think that's important. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2937.9799999999996s)]
*  Tenant. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2938.8199999999997s)]
*  It's a bestie tenant. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2939.66s)]
*  I think so. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2940.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2941.3399999999997s)]
*  Bestie tenant. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2942.18s)]
*  And the other bestie tenant, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2943.02s)]
*  besties always come back together. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2943.8399999999997s)]
*  If we have a fight, we always come back together. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2944.68s)]
*  Sax, can I? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2946.18s)]
*  I'm still mad at you. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2947.02s)]
*  A little bit? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2948.66s)]
*  No, I'm just kidding. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2949.5s)]
*  Okay, wait just. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2951.2999999999997s)]
*  Talking about hypocrisy. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2952.14s)]
*  I mean, so Chris Rock gets up there. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2953.58s)]
*  How great was Sunday night? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2955.58s)]
*  Chris Rock gets up there and he gives like, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2956.42s)]
*  right out of the gate, he's attacking woke. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2957.58s)]
*  Right out of the gate. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2959.8199999999997s)]
*  Swinging, came out swinging like Will Smith. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2961.1s)]
*  Shug Smith, you mean? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2965.8999999999996s)]
*  Shug Smith. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2967.58s)]
*  He took down Will Smith. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2968.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, the Will Smith takedown, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2970.58s)]
*  which you will see in this special, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2972.14s)]
*  is so complete. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2974.14s)]
*  It is just chef's kiss. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2976.62s)]
*  But how great was his set? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2979.1s)]
*  Let's say, just give Chris Rock his flowers. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2980.54s)]
*  Did he filet and fricassee? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2982.8999999999996s)]
*  Will Smith. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2984.9799999999996s)]
*  He did, but I thought the more important part of the set [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2985.8199999999997s)]
*  was the, he came right out, like calling out all this, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2989.58s)]
*  you know, you know, holier than thou woke stuff, yeah. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2992.7599999999998s)]
*  And there was that undercurrent to Chappelle's set as well. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=2997.06s)]
*  And also he said, listen, words can't hurt you [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3000.8199999999997s)]
*  unless you write them on a piece of paper. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3004.12s)]
*  And he said, I'm gonna write them on time to a brick. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3006.5s)]
*  These, a bigger point right now, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3008.7s)]
*  and this does tie into our first story, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3010.62s)]
*  is I think comedians look at Twitter [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3012.5s)]
*  as a place to get canceled, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3015.2999999999997s)]
*  not a place to be part of the discourse. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3016.56s)]
*  And that's a huge loss. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3018.54s)]
*  That's indicative of our society being broken. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3019.66s)]
*  And it's incredibly important [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3023.2999999999997s)]
*  that these comedians be allowed to mock and to speak [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3025.38s)]
*  and to step over the line [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3031.46s)]
*  and challenge us as citizens in a free society. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3033.54s)]
*  And we should cherish them [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3037.7s)]
*  and we should not even try to cancel them. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3039.18s)]
*  Let them cross the line. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3041.06s)]
*  Let them say things that make us uncomfortable [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3043.02s)]
*  so that we can understand ourselves and our society better. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3045.18s)]
*  And I just wanna say- [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3048.42s)]
*  Why can't you include Libs of TikTok in that? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3049.5s)]
*  Oh, do we wanna have a discussion about it? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3052.22s)]
*  I can. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3053.98s)]
*  No, I wanna have a conversation about it. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3054.82s)]
*  I'm just asking you. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3056.06s)]
*  I'm okay with mocking. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3056.9s)]
*  I just don't- No, don't start. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3058.42s)]
*  You guys, you did so well. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3059.34s)]
*  Come on, let's go. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3060.42s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3061.2599999999998s)]
*  No, J. Cal, cut it out. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3062.66s)]
*  All right, well, we have two more science corners to get to. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3064.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3066.38s)]
*  If you don't wanna, I mean, I just wanna say that. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3069.2999999999997s)]
*  No, let's talk about the Coupa deal. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3070.14s)]
*  And Sax, this is right up your alley. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3072.1s)]
*  Have you- [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3073.62s)]
*  I haven't paid a lot of attention to it, to be honest. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3074.46s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3076.58s)]
*  The thing you guys asked is like, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3077.42s)]
*  what signal will Elon's moves at Twitter [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3079.1s)]
*  be for the rest of the tech industry? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3084.5s)]
*  I think the biggest wake-up call is to actually P.E. companies. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3087.46s)]
*  So if you play this out and you think that Coupa is- [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3091.66s)]
*  Explain what Coupa is, please. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3096.8599999999997s)]
*  Coupa is a software as a service company [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3098.54s)]
*  that does revenue management, I guess, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3102.3399999999997s)]
*  or expense forecasting or something in the financial realm. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3105.22s)]
*  I don't particularly know, to be honest. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3109.06s)]
*  But anyways, this is a company that was off [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3111.06s)]
*  70 or 80% from the high, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3114.02s)]
*  like a lot of SaaS companies were [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3115.7s)]
*  when rates started to go up. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3117.14s)]
*  And they got this offer from Toma Bravo. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3119.42s)]
*  But here's what's so interesting about this deal. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3122.62s)]
*  If you think that these guys bought a company, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3124.86s)]
*  I'm just gonna make up a number, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3128.38s)]
*  at 20 times EBITDA, right? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3129.9s)]
*  And you see Elon at Twitter and you think, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3134.9s)]
*  well, wait, maybe we can't cut 75%, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3137.1s)]
*  but maybe we can cut 50% of headcount [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3139.2200000000003s)]
*  and the company can still do well. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3140.9s)]
*  And you take half of the expenses out of the business, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3143.26s)]
*  all of a sudden, if your EBITDA doubles, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3147.38s)]
*  you're actually buying it at 10 times. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3150.26s)]
*  So I think the thing that is the real insight here [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3151.6600000000003s)]
*  is twofold, private equity can still put out [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3156.98s)]
*  a lot of private credit to fund these deals. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3160.7400000000002s)]
*  And SaaS companies are perfect [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3163.06s)]
*  because they have huge free cashflow, right? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3164.34s)]
*  So instead of funding it based on earnings, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3166.1000000000004s)]
*  they can fund it based on ACV and ARR. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3168.1000000000004s)]
*  So private equity will be super active. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3170.82s)]
*  And two, all these rifts basically show [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3172.82s)]
*  what the efficient frontier is for the number of employees [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3176.58s)]
*  you need to run a company. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3178.86s)]
*  And if you can cut 50% of the headcount, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3180.34s)]
*  private equity folks will do that. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3182.82s)]
*  And so I think Coupa is like the canary in the coal mine. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3185.42s)]
*  It is the beginning of what I suspect is a tidal wave [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3188.58s)]
*  of PE sponsored deals in tech companies, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3193.5s)]
*  largely SaaS, but may go into other realms. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3198.02s)]
*  Recurring revenue that can go profitable. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3200.94s)]
*  Taking advantage of these two things. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3202.9s)]
*  Tap the private credit markets and finance it based on ARR, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3204.1800000000003s)]
*  and then fire 50% of the team and double earnings capacity. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3207.74s)]
*  Zach, your thoughts. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3211.06s)]
*  So on Coupa, I thought the most interesting thing [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3211.8999999999996s)]
*  was just the, we got a public comp. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3214.54s)]
*  Well, we got a comp on what private equity is paying [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3217.7s)]
*  for public companies right now. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3220.9399999999996s)]
*  So the deal happened at an $8 billion valuation. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3222.9399999999996s)]
*  That was a 31% premium to the public price. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3226.3799999999997s)]
*  It was 8.4 times next 12 months revenue. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3229.5s)]
*  And on a trailing basis, it was about 10.4 times [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3233.98s)]
*  the last 12 months revenue. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3238.54s)]
*  And by the way, all the comments were around how, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3239.98s)]
*  what a rich price Toma Bravo was paying. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3242.78s)]
*  People generally thought they were paying [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3245.26s)]
*  a premium to the valuation. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3247.14s)]
*  So I think this- [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3249.06s)]
*  By the way, Zach, it was 77% premium [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3249.9s)]
*  before the rumors came out that this was happening. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3252.7400000000002s)]
*  So it was a pretty good premium. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3254.7s)]
*  Yeah, good point. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3255.54s)]
*  And there was a bidding war with Vista. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3256.98s)]
*  And so it was a really rich kind of deal that got done here. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3260.42s)]
*  Right, so my point is that people thought [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3264.54s)]
*  this was a really rich deal. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3267.26s)]
*  And yet the valuation multiples are so much lower [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3268.54s)]
*  than what private company founders expect. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3271.82s)]
*  So remember last year at the peak, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3274.6600000000003s)]
*  founders were thinking 100 times ARR was normal, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3278.7000000000003s)]
*  100 times. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3281.62s)]
*  And you could roughly say ARR is roughly equivalent [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3282.54s)]
*  to next 12 months revenue. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3286.3s)]
*  It's not perfect, but it's roughly the case. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3287.34s)]
*  So these founders were expecting a valuation multiple, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3290.34s)]
*  10 times what the public markets are paying. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3295.42s)]
*  And the public market, and actually the public markets [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3297.9s)]
*  are half of where Toma Bravo was in this particular deal. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3300.54s)]
*  So the public markets right now are valuing [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3304.54s)]
*  the median SaaS company at about five and a half times. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3308.5s)]
*  And a high growth, that'd be for like a 20% [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3311.7400000000002s)]
*  year over year growing company. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3313.82s)]
*  And they're valuing the high growth companies [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3315.38s)]
*  at maybe eight times. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3317.58s)]
*  And Toma Bravo did this at 10 times. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3319.42s)]
*  So that gives you a sense of what the ballpark is. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3321.34s)]
*  And these are companies that are already public, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3323.94s)]
*  they're at scale, they're doing roughly [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3326.06s)]
*  a billion dollars of ARR. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3328.1400000000003s)]
*  They have already kind of won their category to some degree. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3329.98s)]
*  Whereas private companies are subscale. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3334.38s)]
*  They're, typically you're talking about companies [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3336.62s)]
*  with one, five, 10, usually under $20 million of ARR. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3338.9s)]
*  They're not de-risked, there's still a ton of risk. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3343.1400000000003s)]
*  We've seen many, many SaaS companies fizzle out [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3346.1800000000003s)]
*  and plateau at 20 million of ARR, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3350.1400000000003s)]
*  never get to 100 million, nevermind a billion. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3351.46s)]
*  And yet these founders think that they're entitled to, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3354.38s)]
*  even in this market, 30 to 40 times ARR, no way. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3357.6600000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's getting to the point now where [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3360.9s)]
*  maybe it should be 10 times, 20 times, like max. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3364.0200000000004s)]
*  And that'd be for a company that's growing [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3369.1000000000004s)]
*  two and a half, three X year over year. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3371.0600000000004s)]
*  So I still think that, so I think basically [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3373.0200000000004s)]
*  what we're seeing here is even a good scenario, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3375.0600000000004s)]
*  like a coupe acquisition that was done at a premium. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3377.86s)]
*  It's still a wake up call to the private markets [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3381.42s)]
*  that the valuations are still completely [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3383.78s)]
*  and utterly out of whack. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3385.54s)]
*  Yeah, let me ask you a question, Zach. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3386.78s)]
*  So this company was growing 45% last year, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3388.54s)]
*  they're growing 35% this year, and they got this multiple. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3391.3s)]
*  Why is it not worth a significantly higher multiple [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3395.44s)]
*  if a company's growing two and a half to three X, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3398.9s)]
*  which is 250%, 300%, and these guys are only growing 35%? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3401.06s)]
*  Sure, I mean, it is, and that's what you're paying [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3405.78s)]
*  a premium for. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3408.6600000000003s)]
*  But so here's the theory of it, is that if you can invest [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3410.0600000000004s)]
*  in a private company that's say tripling year over year, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3413.94s)]
*  and they can do that for another five years or whatever, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3416.2200000000003s)]
*  then you're- [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3418.82s)]
*  You're paying for that outcome in a couple years. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3419.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, basically, well, think about it. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3421.82s)]
*  You're getting a discount to the outcome in a couple years. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3423.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, if you're paying 30 times today [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3425.3s)]
*  and it triples next year, you're only paying [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3427.2200000000003s)]
*  10 times next year, and if it triples again, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3428.86s)]
*  you're only paying three times. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3430.78s)]
*  So if that keeps going, that's where your arbitrage is. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3431.9s)]
*  But here's the thing you have to weigh against that, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3435.16s)]
*  is that these early stage private companies, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3437.08s)]
*  many things go wrong. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3439.64s)]
*  Yep. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3441.12s)]
*  And they hit a plateau, they fizzle out, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3441.96s)]
*  or their growth rate starts to, the bigger they get, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3443.3999999999996s)]
*  the harder it is to grow. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3447.08s)]
*  So they should be priced at a discount, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3447.92s)]
*  not a premium, because there's risk. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3449.3199999999997s)]
*  There's more risk, they're growing faster, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3451.8999999999996s)]
*  but there's more risk, but also it's very hard. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3453.7999999999997s)]
*  Once you get to a bigger number of ARR, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3456.22s)]
*  50, 100 million of ARR, it's extremely difficult [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3458.6s)]
*  to be doubling or tripling year over year. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3462.12s)]
*  Let me just point one thing out. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3463.64s)]
*  So I looked at the numbers on Coupa, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3464.64s)]
*  I think they had about 170 million of stock-based [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3467.04s)]
*  comp expense in the last nine months. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3469.3599999999997s)]
*  So those are employees that are getting $170 million [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3472.56s)]
*  in compensation in the form of shares. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3476.92s)]
*  So they get those shares, they can then sell those shares [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3480.2s)]
*  and get cash for them. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3482.56s)]
*  On the public markets. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3483.96s)]
*  And then on the public markets and pay their bills. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3485.12s)]
*  So when a company like this goes private, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3487.52s)]
*  for those employees to just remain at their baseline comp, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3490.06s)]
*  that stock-based comp needs to be replaced [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3495.42s)]
*  with something else, or else they're seeing [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3497.02s)]
*  their salaries reduced. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3498.98s)]
*  So there's this balancing game when these companies [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3500.58s)]
*  go private in terms of how do you give them [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3504.34s)]
*  the comp that they're earning to keep them [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3507.66s)]
*  engaged in the business? [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3509.74s)]
*  The answer is you don't. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3510.86s)]
*  Versus, no, but versus cutting the expense. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3512.34s)]
*  You let them quit because you wanna do a riff anyway. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3514.3s)]
*  Right, but for the people that stay, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3516.22s)]
*  so there's a balance, because it's not just, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3519.98s)]
*  hey, cut the OPEX, you have to cut the OPEX [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3521.9s)]
*  including stock-based comp. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3525.1800000000003s)]
*  And this company generated about $100 million, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3526.02s)]
*  sorry, $210 million of free cash flow [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3531.1800000000003s)]
*  or operating cash flow in the last 12 months. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3533.46s)]
*  So if you take out the stock-based comp, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3536.26s)]
*  these guys are actually break even [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3539.42s)]
*  or losing money roughly. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3540.78s)]
*  And so, yeah, break even roughly. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3542.42s)]
*  So there's a real question mark on this business [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3544.78s)]
*  and businesses like this that go private, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3547.6200000000003s)]
*  where if you actually cut the OPEX [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3549.6600000000003s)]
*  and you cut the salaries and you cut the head count, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3551.1800000000003s)]
*  but you have to find new ways to pay people [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3553.54s)]
*  because you've been paying them with stock in the past, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3556.1s)]
*  how do you kind of bridge that gap? [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3558.1s)]
*  And I think that's probably a little bit of the balance [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3559.3s)]
*  and the art of what these guys do well. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3560.98s)]
*  Jamath, if I may, can you explain to the audience [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3562.7s)]
*  what a private equity firm's expectation [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3565.86s)]
*  is in terms of return when they buy a company like this? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3568.98s)]
*  And then, Sax, I saw your tweet that you wanna feature [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3571.62s)]
*  and you'll go next. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3573.7799999999997s)]
*  Go ahead, Jamath. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3574.62s)]
*  Well, I think it's changed over time [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3575.98s)]
*  and this is what's so powerful [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3577.58s)]
*  about the private equity industry. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3579.22s)]
*  Look, you have to think about what their incentive is [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3581.66s)]
*  because it kind of guides the outcome. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3584.7799999999997s)]
*  Early on, they were very much like venture capitalists. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3587.62s)]
*  They were out in the edges of risk-taking, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3590.42s)]
*  doing all kinds of very difficult, gnarly deals. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3595.1s)]
*  So if you look back in the history of private equity, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3598.5s)]
*  these huge, crazy deals like RJR Nabisco or TWA Airlines [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3601.18s)]
*  were the first of the industry [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3605.22s)]
*  and they weeped enormous returns. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3608.2999999999997s)]
*  But there was a lot of risk [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3611.1s)]
*  and it required very heavy-handed management. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3612.22s)]
*  Oftentimes, what that meant was firing a lot of people. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3615.06s)]
*  Over time, private equity has gotten institutionalized [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3618.7s)]
*  and they don't generally [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3621.98s)]
*  feature themselves as a place to get the best [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3626.9s)]
*  necessarily returns, but they are places where you can put [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3629.38s)]
*  enormous amounts of money, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3632.86s)]
*  where the likelihood of loss is extremely zero [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3634.94s)]
*  and you generate very good rates of return. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3639.22s)]
*  Now, again, this depends on whether you wanna look at IRR [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3643.4199999999996s)]
*  or DPI, right? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3646.8199999999997s)]
*  So a lot of people will market IRR, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3648.62s)]
*  which I think is kind of like a gameable metric, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3652.2999999999997s)]
*  but those IRRs can be 20, 25%. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3655.4199999999996s)]
*  If you look at DPI, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3658.8999999999996s)]
*  which is really how much cash you get back, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3660.06s)]
*  private equity firms can generate one and a half to 2X [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3662.74s)]
*  of the money you give them, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3665.4599999999996s)]
*  but they do it consistently [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3667.4599999999996s)]
*  and they very rarely lose money. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3669.42s)]
*  So all of that is important into understanding [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3671.34s)]
*  what's gonna happen in this cycle. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3674.02s)]
*  These folks are going to buy a ton [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3676.02s)]
*  of these private software companies. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3678.86s)]
*  I think that they are going to fire lots of people. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3681.3s)]
*  I think they are going to make these companies [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3685.2200000000003s)]
*  run hyper-efficiently [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3687.06s)]
*  and they will make sure that they generate that 1.2 [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3689.1000000000004s)]
*  to 1.7X that has been historical. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3693.02s)]
*  Very rarely will they lose money in these things. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3695.86s)]
*  By the way, that's gonna mean [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3699.1800000000003s)]
*  that a lot of these other companies [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3700.7000000000003s)]
*  will have to reset valuation. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3701.98s)]
*  So you saw yesterday, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3703.34s)]
*  Checkout.com went from a $40 billion valuation down to 11. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3705.1s)]
*  You're seeing some companies only go down 10 or 15%. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3710.26s)]
*  But it's all happening. It's a process, isn't it Chamath? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3714.2200000000003s)]
*  Isn't this just like what happens in real estate where- [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3715.7400000000002s)]
*  It's the beginning of this process. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3718.1s)]
*  Yes, because in real estate, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3719.46s)]
*  my understanding having a lift to these boom-mah cycles [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3720.82s)]
*  is the person living in the home [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3723.06s)]
*  still believes their home is worth [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3724.7799999999997s)]
*  this incredible evaluation. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3727.02s)]
*  And then the people who want to buy it are like, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3728.5s)]
*  that doesn't match reality. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3730.5s)]
*  And then the real estate brokers go back and forth, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3732.06s)]
*  trying to get people to go through this messy middle [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3734.3399999999997s)]
*  and come to true price discovery. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3737.8199999999997s)]
*  A private company, it's hard to get true price discovery [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3739.2999999999997s)]
*  until they're on the brink of insolvency. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3742.06s)]
*  They don't have the money. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3743.8599999999997s)]
*  We just got some data on that actually. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3744.7s)]
*  Can we bring this Cooley data in? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3746.7s)]
*  Let's do it. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3749.02s)]
*  Yeah, so Cooley looked at- [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3749.8599999999997s)]
*  A law firm in Silicon Valley. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3752.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they're a prominent Silicon Valley law firm. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3753.58s)]
*  They looked at a thousand deals [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3755.58s)]
*  over the last three quarters of this year. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3756.8199999999997s)]
*  And what they saw is that the later the stage, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3759.18s)]
*  the bigger the valuation correction. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3762.7799999999997s)]
*  So series D rounds went from three and a half billion [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3764.14s)]
*  to 527 million. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3766.98s)]
*  That's an 85%. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3768.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's an 85% drop. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3770.2599999999998s)]
*  Series C went from 502 million to 130 million. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3772.54s)]
*  That's a 74% drop. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3775.62s)]
*  Series B went from 164 to 90. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3777.94s)]
*  That's a 45% drop. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3780.18s)]
*  And then series A went from 58 to 45. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3782.22s)]
*  That's only a 22% drop. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3784.3799999999997s)]
*  There's just less room to compress there. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3785.8999999999996s)]
*  But the point is that series B roughly a 50% drop. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3788.8599999999997s)]
*  Series C roughly a three quarters drop. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3792.66s)]
*  And series D roughly a 85%. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3795.22s)]
*  Yeah, one seventh drop. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3800.58s)]
*  So I think founders right now, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3802.22s)]
*  they're just like a little bit delusional [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3804.2599999999998s)]
*  about this money they raised last year. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3806.18s)]
*  They're still way too anchored on last year's valuation. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3809.02s)]
*  And if only they would think in terms of this capital [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3812.86s)]
*  they raised last year in terms of its real dilution [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3815.22s)]
*  in terms of what the company is worth now, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3819.86s)]
*  I think they'd be treating it more precious. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3822.54s)]
*  So for example, hold on. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3824.42s)]
*  If you raise- [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3827.2599999999998s)]
*  It's like they won the lottery and they don't wanna, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3828.1s)]
*  they don't realize they won the lottery. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3829.74s)]
*  I had this conversation with the founder. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3830.9s)]
*  This is the only money they're ever gonna see [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3832.58s)]
*  is the bottom line. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3834.54s)]
*  And they're spending it like they're gonna win [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3835.54s)]
*  the lottery every year. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3836.7s)]
*  So for example, let's say you take a company. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3837.86s)]
*  Yeah, let's say you take a company [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3839.9s)]
*  that raised 200 million last year at 2 billion. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3842.3799999999997s)]
*  So it was 10% dilution. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3844.4199999999996s)]
*  So in their heads they're thinking, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3846.14s)]
*  oh, well, this isn't that expensive. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3847.3399999999997s)]
*  Like 10% dilution's a rounding error, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3849.1s)]
*  but really probably the company is worth [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3851.2599999999998s)]
*  maybe 400 million now, right? [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3853.8599999999997s)]
*  Cause it's gone down 80%. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3856.1s)]
*  This 200 million of your 400 million [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3857.66s)]
*  is half the value of the company. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3860.02s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3861.62s)]
*  And you're squandering it. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3862.4599999999996s)]
*  You're squandering it at a rate of 100 million a year. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3863.2999999999997s)]
*  So you're basically burning up 25% of the value [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3865.7s)]
*  of your company this year and the next year. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3868.5s)]
*  And then by the way, you're gonna be in crisis [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3870.42s)]
*  after that, cause you're probably- [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3872.7400000000002s)]
*  It's like a lottery winner buying like a giant super yacht. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3873.58s)]
*  I had an observation that a lot of the investors [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3876.58s)]
*  that sit on the boards of these companies, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3879.1s)]
*  they have an incentive to not see those valuations [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3882.62s)]
*  come down too quickly, do they not? [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3886.1800000000003s)]
*  And so there is this sort of like interest in, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3888.42s)]
*  hey, I don't want you to have to go reprice the company [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3892.14s)]
*  or do a down round because then my portfolio [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3894.46s)]
*  gets written down and then I'm in the middle, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3896.38s)]
*  everyone's always in the middle of a fundraising cycle [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3898.5s)]
*  with LPs and then I'm gonna have a tough conversation [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3901.1000000000004s)]
*  with my LPs about my value. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3902.82s)]
*  So do you not see VCs and investors playing an active role [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3904.94s)]
*  in trying to keep the valuations propped up to some extent, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3909.7400000000002s)]
*  particularly where they have big markups, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3912.9s)]
*  100% either by extending bridge rounds [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3914.38s)]
*  or doing other sorts of, you know- [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3917.1400000000003s)]
*  Look, nobody likes to go through a down round [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3920.5400000000004s)]
*  and that includes founders and existing investors [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3923.42s)]
*  in the company. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3925.7400000000002s)]
*  That being said, we're not talking here about new financing [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3926.5800000000004s)]
*  conversations, we're talking about is advice [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3929.58s)]
*  that is happening in board meetings. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3932.9s)]
*  And, you know, maybe other VCs aren't pushing as hard [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3934.86s)]
*  as we are, but the advice I'm giving in board meetings [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3937.98s)]
*  is what I'm telling you publicly today, [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3940.9s)]
*  which is this is the last money you may be able to raise [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3942.9s)]
*  on attractive terms, if at all, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3945.7799999999997s)]
*  you need to treat it much more preciously. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3948.06s)]
*  The world has fundamentally changed. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3950.02s)]
*  And by the way, we haven't even gotten into what's coming, [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3951.74s)]
*  the demand contraction that's coming next year. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3954.54s)]
*  Explain what demand contraction is for the audience, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3957.98s)]
*  please, thank you. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3960.34s)]
*  Okay, look, there's gonna be three major sources [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3961.18s)]
*  of slowdown for software companies next year. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3963.62s)]
*  Number one, new business is gonna dry up. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3966.26s)]
*  Companies are just gonna be spending a lot less money [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3969.38s)]
*  next year because they're all cutting costs. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3972.02s)]
*  So you should expect your new business to be roughly 50% [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3974.2200000000003s)]
*  of what it was. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3978.1s)]
*  Next year, it'll be 50% of what it was last year. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3979.7000000000003s)]
*  That's my rule of thumb for most companies, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3982.26s)]
*  new business down 50%. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3984.58s)]
*  Number two, churn is gonna be higher. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3986.02s)]
*  We haven't seen that much logo churn yet, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3988.06s)]
*  but next year, a lot of companies are gonna start [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3990.3s)]
*  going out of business. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3993.1s)]
*  And it's gonna happen over the next two years. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3994.2599999999998s)]
*  So you're simply gonna see logo churn rates, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3996.02s)]
*  say among small businesses, go from like a historical norm [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=3998.94s)]
*  of 15% to maybe 25 or 30. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4002.2599999999998s)]
*  In other words, your customer, the logo goes poof. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4005.38s)]
*  That's what a logo means, yes. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4010.22s)]
*  Yes, and the third major source, yes, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4012.06s)]
*  logo churn means the energy doesn't exist. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4014.18s)]
*  And then you've got seat contraction, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4016.7400000000002s)]
*  which is these companies are not hiring as fast. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4018.5s)]
*  In fact, they're doing layoffs. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4021.46s)]
*  So they're simply not gonna buy as many seats [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4022.78s)]
*  of your software as you need to in the past. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4025.6600000000003s)]
*  For the last decade, we've had a tailwind, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4027.58s)]
*  an enormous tailwind for software companies [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4030.06s)]
*  of seat expansion, which is every year, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4031.86s)]
*  your existing customers would buy more seats [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4034.2200000000003s)]
*  of your product for their new employees. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4036.34s)]
*  Now they're actually gonna have fewer employees [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4038.42s)]
*  or maybe headcount freezes. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4040.94s)]
*  So they're actually buying fewer seats. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4042.34s)]
*  By the way, if you take all those three things, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4044.46s)]
*  the deal of the century was Figma selling [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4047.18s)]
*  to Adobe for 20 billion. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4050.2200000000003s)]
*  Because if you take those three things, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4052.02s)]
*  I mean, oh my God, they just absolutely top ticked [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4054.66s)]
*  before any of this stuff was known. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4057.7400000000002s)]
*  So today Adobe could probably buy this thing [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4059.94s)]
*  for like seven billion instead of 20 billion. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4062.34s)]
*  So does that mean they try to do a breakup fee [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4065.78s)]
*  and get out of the deal? [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4068.06s)]
*  I don't know, but if I was Figma, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4070.14s)]
*  I'd try to close this thing ASAP and get that money out. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4071.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4074.78s)]
*  Yeah, you're right about that. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4075.78s)]
*  And by the way, what I'm seeing from founders is [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4076.9s)]
*  that they still want to grow 100% plus over the next year. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4079.2200000000003s)]
*  The problem is that the headwinds are gonna be intense. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4083.6200000000003s)]
*  So if you're flying a plane and the headwinds [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4087.26s)]
*  are extremely intense and you try to maintain your speed, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4090.2200000000003s)]
*  you're gonna burn an enormous amount of fuel. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4093.06s)]
*  You're gonna be incredibly inefficient. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4094.9s)]
*  It's better to basically just moderate your speed, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4097.34s)]
*  let the headwinds basically pass. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4100.94s)]
*  We're gonna have major economic headwinds [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4102.98s)]
*  for the next four to six quarters, call it year and a half. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4104.46s)]
*  It's okay to have a slower growth rate, preserve your cash, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4108.0199999999995s)]
*  don't burn up your fuel. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4111.5s)]
*  Yeah, bunker down. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4112.66s)]
*  So what we're trying to do is give, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4113.82s)]
*  we're trying to give permission to our founders [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4115.86s)]
*  to grow at a slower rate because they feel [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4117.9s)]
*  this enormous pressure from their VCs [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4120.46s)]
*  to grow at insane rates. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4121.9s)]
*  Can I build on this? [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4124.74s)]
*  I think Freebrook said it very well. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4125.58s)]
*  The scan in venture capital is demonstrated [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4126.94s)]
*  in the following chart. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4129.42s)]
*  This is using Cambridge and our friend Brad Gerstner [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4130.46s)]
*  helped put this together. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4133.38s)]
*  So what is this? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4135.06s)]
*  This goes back all the way to 1997. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4135.94s)]
*  And the gray bar is what venture capitalists [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4138.78s)]
*  share with their limited partners [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4144.22s)]
*  as to how well they are doing. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4147.38s)]
*  What it's called- [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4149.42s)]
*  The top quartile of venture capitalists. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4150.26s)]
*  And this is the top 25%. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4151.34s)]
*  So this is a venture capitalist [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4153.02s)]
*  and our returns have been consistently top quartile. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4155.38s)]
*  So instead of cherry picking anybody else, [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4158.74s)]
*  I'll just use us, but it could be Sequoia, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4160.66s)]
*  Benchmark, you name it. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4163.0199999999995s)]
*  We would go back- [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4164.0199999999995s)]
*  Launch, we're in there. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4164.86s)]
*  Launch, you would go back to folks, Craft, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4165.679999999999s)]
*  you would go back to folks and say, [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4167.42s)]
*  hey guys, the total value of our portfolio [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4168.42s)]
*  is three times your money in 1997's Vintage. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4171.7s)]
*  Okay? [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4175.0199999999995s)]
*  It was four times your money in the 2010 Vintage. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4176.139999999999s)]
*  Feels really good. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4180.139999999999s)]
*  But again, the job of the venture capitalist [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4181.7s)]
*  is to convert the gray bar into the purple bar. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4184.58s)]
*  And historically, there's been a decay. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4190.66s)]
*  So for every dollar of gray bar that you show, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4193.54s)]
*  you typically only get 73 cents actually returned to people. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4196.54s)]
*  Okay? [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4200.0599999999995s)]
*  The paper value, the book value versus- [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4200.98s)]
*  Just to be clear, the valuations that you get [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4202.7s)]
*  when you sell your company or it goes public [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4205.18s)]
*  end up being 73% of what you marked at the peak, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4207.42s)]
*  what you said they were worth. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4210.66s)]
*  Exactly right. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4211.5s)]
*  Exactly right. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4212.34s)]
*  And the actual value of this purple bar, [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4213.38s)]
*  going back 30 years, is 1.7x. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4217.14s)]
*  So just to put numerical numbers on this, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4222.14s)]
*  if you were a venture capitalist, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4224.42s)]
*  you would raise a $100 fund. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4226.58s)]
*  At the peak, you would actually show [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4229.22s)]
*  that that $100 became 200 and about $28. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4232.1s)]
*  But when push came to shove and when it was all said and done, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4236.7s)]
*  you would return $170 back to your investors. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4240.5s)]
*  That's the rough equation. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4243.42s)]
*  So what's the problem? [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4245.66s)]
*  Well, the problem, as you can see in this chart, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4247.14s)]
*  is right around 2015, which is all of a sudden, [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4249.78s)]
*  what we've started to see [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4255.46s)]
*  are these continually elevated gray bars. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4256.86s)]
*  Yes, this stuff is worth seven times, six times, five times. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4261.7s)]
*  But we have not seen the purple bars catch up. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4266.66s)]
*  Now, some people will say, well, yeah, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4269.78s)]
*  but you have to give it time. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4271.139999999999s)]
*  And this is probably what other vintage look times. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4272.5s)]
*  And all you need to do is do what's called a regression. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4276.38s)]
*  And you need to regress these things to the mean [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4279.9s)]
*  and make the following assumption. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4282.259999999999s)]
*  Assume for a second that this time is not different. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4284.58s)]
*  Assume that these historical averages, 2.2x, 1.7x holds. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4288.94s)]
*  Well, that's what the black line here shows. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4294.9s)]
*  You can calculate the area above the curve [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4297.62s)]
*  as the value at risk, right? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4301.62s)]
*  The amount of money we will destroy [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4303.3s)]
*  because of all these shenanigans [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4306.0599999999995s)]
*  that Freebird just talked about. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4307.42s)]
*  Propping up marks, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4308.9s)]
*  not willing to look at actual market clearing prices. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4310.42s)]
*  Well, if you do the math, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4313.74s)]
*  the sum of the area above this black line [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4315.14s)]
*  is almost a trillion dollars around the world. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4318.42s)]
*  And it is about $600 billion for US venture capitalists. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4321.14s)]
*  This is the dynamic that the private equity industry [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4326.26s)]
*  is gonna prey on. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4329.14s)]
*  So if you saw Toma Bravo just close the $32 billion round, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4330.34s)]
*  Vista's raising a $20 billion round, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4334.02s)]
*  everybody's stepping into tech, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4336.74s)]
*  they are going to destroy those gray bars. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4338.78s)]
*  Would you describe that as bottom feeding? [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4340.74s)]
*  No. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4342.74s)]
*  No, why would I? [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4343.58s)]
*  They are the rational actor [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4344.42s)]
*  who is finding the true market clearing price. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4346.58s)]
*  The true market price. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4348.42s)]
*  I think the private equity industry [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4349.54s)]
*  is unbelievably precise and talented [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4351.54s)]
*  in being dispassionate [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4355.46s)]
*  and telling us what these things are worth. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4356.94s)]
*  They're cutthroat. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4358.18s)]
*  They're logical. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4359.02s)]
*  No, no, it's not cutthroat. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4359.86s)]
*  I'm sorry, that opportunity for the private equity industry [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4360.7s)]
*  is gonna be created by profligate founders. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4363.66s)]
*  And look, you could blame VCs [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4366.74s)]
*  for the high marks last year as well. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4367.98s)]
*  They were profligate too. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4370.3s)]
*  But look, if you're a founder, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4371.3s)]
*  if you don't start acting in a more capital efficient way [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4373.82s)]
*  and preserve your cash, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4376.9s)]
*  your company is ultimately gonna be owned [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4378.46s)]
*  by a private equity firm [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4379.82s)]
*  and they're gonna make all the money. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4380.9s)]
*  Well, here's an important- [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4382.46s)]
*  Because, hold on, because when you sell to them [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4383.299999999999s)]
*  at a low price, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4385.62s)]
*  all you're gonna end up doing [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4386.58s)]
*  is paying back the liquidation preference. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4387.54s)]
*  And then that private equity firm [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4389.9s)]
*  that was willing to do- Or less. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4391.7s)]
*  Or less, but that private equity firm [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4392.98s)]
*  will be willing to do what you were not willing to do, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4395.0599999999995s)]
*  which was simply cut your burn, [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4397.82s)]
*  cut your costs and act in a more capital efficient way. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4400.54s)]
*  And they will end up making all the upside [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4402.94s)]
*  for your decade of hard work [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4404.82s)]
*  because you got basically addicted to venture capital [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4406.66s)]
*  and the high valuations and refuse to, again, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4409.9s)]
*  adjust to the regime change that we're describing. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4413.42s)]
*  I'll give you an alternative. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4415.299999999999s)]
*  I'll give you an alternative. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4416.339999999999s)]
*  The alternative is that the majority of acquisitions [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4417.42s)]
*  made by private equity firms [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4420.139999999999s)]
*  are not actually pure acquisitions. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4421.46s)]
*  They're bolt-on acquisitions, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4423.58s)]
*  meaning that these are companies that are added [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4425.299999999999s)]
*  to existing platforms that they own. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4427.0599999999995s)]
*  So this acquisition they're doing of Coupa, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4429.099999999999s)]
*  I think it's very likely over the next couple of years, [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4431.259999999999s)]
*  you will see like the playbook in private equity [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4433.42s)]
*  includes not just cost cutting, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4435.9s)]
*  but also synergy building. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4437.94s)]
*  And they typically do bolt-ons and add-ons, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4440.18s)]
*  and this happens across all private equity platform deals [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4441.78s)]
*  of new products and services [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4444.58s)]
*  that can be sold through the existing sales channel, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4445.86s)]
*  the existing customer base, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4448.14s)]
*  and as an add-on to the existing service [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4450.22s)]
*  or product that's already offered. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4452.3s)]
*  So one of the things that I think you may see [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4453.82s)]
*  in Silicon Valley over the next couple of years [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4456.66s)]
*  is a rationalization away from funding feature companies [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4459.06s)]
*  and thinking much more carefully [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4462.78s)]
*  about what can be true standalone product companies. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4464.02s)]
*  And many of these companies [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4466.5s)]
*  that have raised a ton of capital [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4467.5s)]
*  and have gotten crazy valuations, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4469.34s)]
*  at the end of the day, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4471.86s)]
*  they're more likely better equipped [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4473.1s)]
*  to be a feature of another platform [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4474.54s)]
*  than they are to be a standalone platform company [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4476.66s)]
*  of their own. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4478.7s)]
*  And that's where the majority of these acquisitions [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4479.54s)]
*  will likely end up going [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4481.82s)]
*  in the private equity landscape. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4483.62s)]
*  And they will be vacuumed up [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4485.22s)]
*  and attached to existing platforms [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4486.98s)]
*  that these private equity guys are building out. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4488.86s)]
*  And by the way, just look as an example [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4490.46s)]
*  at what Oracle did over the years, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4492.22s)]
*  what Salesforce did over the years, what Google did, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4493.74s)]
*  so many of these companies. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4496.14s)]
*  Bolt on acquisitions. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4498.1s)]
*  Bolt on acquisitions by building a sale channel, [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4498.9400000000005s)]
*  building a platform, and then adding on top of that. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4501.18s)]
*  And I think that's what a lot of these guys [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4503.9400000000005s)]
*  are gonna try and mimic. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4505.22s)]
*  Two critical points. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4506.26s)]
*  Number one, what about the bottom 75% of VCs? [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4507.26s)]
*  If you show that chart just for one more second, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4511.02s)]
*  I just wanna remind everybody [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4513.34s)]
*  that is the absolute cream of the crop VCs. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4514.860000000001s)]
*  Top 25%. This is the best of the best. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4517.9800000000005s)]
*  These are folks, I mean, again, I'll just say us, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4519.42s)]
*  Sequoia, Benchmark, we've consistently been top quartile. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4522.1s)]
*  Thank you. Launched craft. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4524.7s)]
*  These are top quartile return streams. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4526.02s)]
*  Thank the Lord. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4527.540000000001s)]
*  What about the bottom 75%? [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4528.620000000001s)]
*  They're not gonna be able to raise funds, man. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4530.18s)]
*  It's over. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4531.42s)]
*  A lot of these people who raised first time funds [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4532.26s)]
*  in the last three or four years. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4533.860000000001s)]
*  It's also the companies that SAC said, [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4535.46s)]
*  because like, it's like, today is the, [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4537.02s)]
*  now is the moment for the sober founder [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4540.780000000001s)]
*  and the sober venture capitalist to sit and say, [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4543.540000000001s)]
*  what is the real valuation? [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4546.14s)]
*  Let's go ahead. What do we need to do [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4547.860000000001s)]
*  to make sure that this company has a chance? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4548.780000000001s)]
*  Because what SAC said is so true. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4550.26s)]
*  Otherwise, all these profit dollars [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4552.5s)]
*  will be made by the private equity fees. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4555.22s)]
*  In order to win today, you're gonna have to grind. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4557.26s)]
*  You're gonna have to work 50, 60 hours a week. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4560.14s)]
*  You're gonna have to be absolutely embrace [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4562.66s)]
*  the age of austerity. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4565.26s)]
*  And you're gonna have to focus on your customer, [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4566.38s)]
*  your product and your bottom line. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4568.74s)]
*  The age of excess is over. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4570.58s)]
*  If you're not working 50, 60, 70 hours a week, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4572.78s)]
*  you're not gonna cut it in Silicon Valley. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4575.06s)]
*  Also key second point, profligate. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4576.86s)]
*  Extravagant or wasteful in the use of resources. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4579.9800000000005s)]
*  So we get the word of the day from David Sacks. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4583.3s)]
*  That's David Sacks' word of the day. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4584.5s)]
*  After a very powerful bull weevil. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4586.3s)]
*  This is bull weevil. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4588.34s)]
*  That went crazy. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4589.86s)]
*  Did you see the tremor? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4590.7s)]
*  Bull weevil went viral. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4591.54s)]
*  This is, I think, Elon's biggest non-obvious impact [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4596.66s)]
*  in this moment. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4600.3s)]
*  J.Tow, here's your one answer to your question [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4601.14s)]
*  about what happens to the bottom 75% of venture firms. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4603.62s)]
*  It's equivalent to what happens with the, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4608.66s)]
*  you know, kind of, this is the bottom of the top, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4610.98s)]
*  this slide that I just shared. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4613.7s)]
*  It's the one we looked at a few weeks ago. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4614.94s)]
*  And I keep referring to it [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4616.7s)]
*  because it's just such a staggering demonstration [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4617.94s)]
*  of what people call the power law, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4621.299999999999s)]
*  which is how excess returns accumulate [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4623.58s)]
*  to minority of investments. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4626.62s)]
*  So just a few investments make up the bulk of value [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4627.9s)]
*  that the market cap of 43% of companies [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4631.419999999999s)]
*  that have gone public since 2020 is $750 billion. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4636.7s)]
*  The market cap of the other 300 is only $26 billion. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4642.74s)]
*  And the cash that went in to the $750 billion is 136. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4647.34s)]
*  And the cash that went into the 26 is 107. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4652.26s)]
*  And so the cash that went in to generate that 26 billion, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4656.14s)]
*  that 107, that's your bottom 50%. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4659.02s)]
*  And the top 50% put in 136 to make 750. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4662.34s)]
*  And I think it gets even narrower [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4666.26s)]
*  as you move further up to that top core tile. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4667.7s)]
*  So, you know, it's just- [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4669.9400000000005s)]
*  I can tell you what LPs are saying [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4671.22s)]
*  because it's a hard business to try to shift. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4673.18s)]
*  This is the companies that went public. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4675.22s)]
*  So this is also of the top company, [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4676.66s)]
*  of the top funds and the top companies [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4679.38s)]
*  that were actually able to IPO. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4681.02s)]
*  And so it highlights how much of a power law [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4683.14s)]
*  actually plays through. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4685.34s)]
*  And so the majority of these companies, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4686.7s)]
*  as in Chamath, even in your chart, [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4688.34s)]
*  you show the top core tile. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4690.42s)]
*  The bottom 75% or the bottom 50%, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4692.06s)]
*  I've looked at this data as well, [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4695.3s)]
*  of those various vintages are below 1.0. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4697.02s)]
*  They lose money for their LPs. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4699.38s)]
*  Oh, consistently. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4701.42s)]
*  And it's a cycle. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4702.42s)]
*  And so what ends up happening [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4703.62s)]
*  is the next generation comes through. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4704.46s)]
*  And LPs, they make a portfolio of bets [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4705.900000000001s)]
*  and they hope that they make enough bets in the right VCs [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4708.58s)]
*  that their portfolio generates greater than, you know, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4711.9800000000005s)]
*  market returns, greater than, call it 15, 20% target, [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4714.18s)]
*  15% target, but they're gonna expect [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4717.1s)]
*  that the majority are not. LPs. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4719.820000000001s)]
*  I have an LP report. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4721.14s)]
*  I'm out there raising launch fund four right now. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4722.900000000001s)]
*  And I moved from like the accrediteds, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4724.5s)]
*  the individual investors. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4726.34s)]
*  Are you allowed to say that? [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4727.18s)]
*  Oh yeah, because you're in the range of space. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4728.02s)]
*  Yeah, I'm on 506C. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4728.86s)]
*  So I'm publicly raising it. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4729.7s)]
*  And I've moved on from individual investors, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4731.54s)]
*  $45 million in commits after five webinars. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4734.22s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4736.62s)]
*  Now I'm talking to, no, it was amazing. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4737.58s)]
*  It's just 506C is gonna change the entire industry. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4740.14s)]
*  Letting the masses have some access to this capital [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4742.66s)]
*  and this opportunity, accrediteds and QBs, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4747.38s)]
*  is gonna change the world, I believe. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4749.26s)]
*  Do you have to deal with every one of them [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4751.18s)]
*  or is it easy to administer? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4753.46s)]
*  It's incredibly complex [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4754.86s)]
*  because you have a large number of people [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4756.82s)]
*  and they all wanna talk to me. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4758.06s)]
*  So I did webinars, five webinars, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4758.9800000000005s)]
*  and it resulted in hundreds of commits, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4761.38s)]
*  hundreds of commits for $45 million. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4762.9800000000005s)]
*  But you'll be able to get all those capital commitments [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4764.54s)]
*  drawn down when you need to. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4767.54s)]
*  Like you have to go ping a couple hundred people [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4768.7s)]
*  and get them all to wire money to you every time [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4770.7s)]
*  you get a request. You need to have [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4771.9800000000005s)]
*  more operations people. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4772.8s)]
*  And we only do four. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4773.64s)]
*  We let them. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4775.02s)]
*  One thing you may wanna do is like for these smaller slugs [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4775.86s)]
*  is you can prewire, you can set up an escrow can [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4779.9s)]
*  where you prewire 100% of the capital. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4782.42s)]
*  Yes, and then you also don't have to, [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4784.18s)]
*  you take it down when you're gonna deploy it [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4785.82s)]
*  so you keep your IRR correct. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4787.38s)]
*  So we're actually looking into those solutions. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4789.02s)]
*  I'll talk to you offline. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4790.34s)]
*  But I just did my first two meetings with endowments, [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4791.18s)]
*  et cetera, fund to funds. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4794.06s)]
*  The entire discussions right now are around [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4795.4800000000005s)]
*  what is your secondary strategy? [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4799.5s)]
*  How are you getting in earlier, not later? [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4801.7s)]
*  And how are you building a larger position? [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4804.9400000000005s)]
*  It is, and even like some of the QPs [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4807.14s)]
*  who are sophisticated in our, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4809.3s)]
*  are in over 10 venture funds. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4810.9400000000005s)]
*  The entire discussion governance of these companies, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4812.900000000001s)]
*  are you taking board seats or not? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4816.14s)]
*  How early are you getting in [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4817.74s)]
*  and building a larger position over 10% [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4819.14s)]
*  and what is your secondary strategy? [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4821.14s)]
*  When are you gonna start taking some chips off the table? [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4824.02s)]
*  So the, and I gotta say, if you're an LP [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4826.12s)]
*  who didn't sell into the up market at all, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4828.74s)]
*  and you're on your first fund, [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4831.66s)]
*  and you had all these great marks [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4833.66s)]
*  and they're getting, they're coming crashing down, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4834.66s)]
*  they're not gonna deal with you. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4836.96s)]
*  They just have too many options [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4838.3s)]
*  of top funds in the quartile. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4839.5s)]
*  I don't think they've started to come down yet. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4840.34s)]
*  I don't think we know what the top quartile [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4842.9800000000005s)]
*  is really gonna look like over these last few years. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4845.54s)]
*  I think that's gonna take four or five years [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4847.900000000001s)]
*  to really sort out. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4849.66s)]
*  Of course, yeah. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4850.5s)]
*  So I think that- Explain why Chamath, [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4851.9800000000005s)]
*  just so people understand. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4853.34s)]
*  I understand. Well, I think that there are [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4854.62s)]
*  lots of valuations that have supported huge TVPIs, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4856.900000000001s)]
*  these paper gains that have allowed venture funds [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4864.820000000001s)]
*  to raise enormous amounts of incremental capital [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4867.92s)]
*  in new funds. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4871.52s)]
*  And so they are going to try to wait as long as possible [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4873.76s)]
*  before they're held accountable for that. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4877.4s)]
*  And the best way to do that is to not change the valuation. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4879.64s)]
*  And so it will happen slowly. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4882.92s)]
*  It'll be a trickle of these things. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4884.96s)]
*  And I think that takes probably four or five years [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4888.4800000000005s)]
*  for it to really sort itself out. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4891.0s)]
*  But in the meantime, companies will still need [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4892.4800000000005s)]
*  to get financed. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4894.92s)]
*  Companies will still need to get built. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4895.96s)]
*  That's why I think the public markets, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4898.4s)]
*  I think what Sac says is true, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4900.86s)]
*  giving us a signal of what these true [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4903.28s)]
*  market clearing prices are, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4904.8s)]
*  will eventually slip into these Series D or E companies [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4906.6s)]
*  because a venture capitalist who has now taken [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4910.16s)]
*  some big write downs in one part of their portfolio, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4913.08s)]
*  I suspect will now be very open to selling to private equity [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4916.34s)]
*  for another part of their portfolio [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4919.4800000000005s)]
*  so that they can return capital. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4920.82s)]
*  Totally. Totally agree. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4921.96s)]
*  Yeah. It's gonna be rough out there. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4923.88s)]
*  You guys watch White Lotus? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4926.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4928.16s)]
*  I just started season one. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4929.0s)]
*  I'm the third episode in. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4929.84s)]
*  Okay, we won't say anything. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4932.08s)]
*  What a treat. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4932.92s)]
*  We won't say anything, but how great was season two? [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4933.740000000001s)]
*  Oh, the rap was awesome. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4936.68s)]
*  It's just incredible. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4938.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm about to say anything. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4939.08s)]
*  The last two episodes were extraordinary. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4940.04s)]
*  Yeah, let's not say anything. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4941.360000000001s)]
*  What a great show. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4942.2s)]
*  Matt and I just finished watching all of Handmaid's Tale, [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4943.04s)]
*  which I will tell you is, [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4945.84s)]
*  that is a fucking stressful show. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4947.56s)]
*  It's like you're putting in work. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4950.6s)]
*  When you're done those episodes, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4952.280000000001s)]
*  you're like, oh my God. It is emotional labor. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4953.68s)]
*  When they said this emotional labor, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4956.52s)]
*  watching that show is like, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4957.4400000000005s)]
*  it could not be more sadistic and insane. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4959.52s)]
*  It is brutal, but you can't look away. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4963.400000000001s)]
*  Incredibly well done. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4966.4800000000005s)]
*  All right, listen, this has been an amazing episode. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4968.200000000001s)]
*  And this is news for the other besties. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4970.76s)]
*  Friedberg and I have been secretly collaborating. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4974.96s)]
*  We have come to a plan that we're working on a joint plan [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4978.320000000001s)]
*  for All in Summit 2023, [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4983.08s)]
*  because we are both helping each other out [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4985.2s)]
*  on secret projects. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4987.24s)]
*  I'm ready to tip, guys. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4988.44s)]
*  Ooh, I love it, the tip. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4989.84s)]
*  I, ooh, the tip. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4991.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't even know. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4992.84s)]
*  That's it, we don't need you, Sax. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4993.84s)]
*  I'm a permanent no. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4995.4s)]
*  That's fine, we know that. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4996.96s)]
*  You're locked in no. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4998.44s)]
*  I love that I have Sax as my anchor on this one. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=4999.36s)]
*  I can always float back that way if I need to. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=5001.28s)]
*  This thing could flip. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=5002.92s)]
*  But Friedberg and I are in this case, [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=5003.88s)]
*  money is the root of all evil. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=5007.16s)]
*  Totally. In this case. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=5008.68s)]
*  But power and influence is something that, [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=5009.8s)]
*  as Friedberg and Celebrity, [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=5013.8s)]
*  Friedberg had so much of a good time at All in Summit 2022 [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=5015.8s)]
*  that his hatred of my producer fee [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=5020.28s)]
*  is less than his joy from the event. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=5022.72s)]
*  And we are collaborating on SuperGut. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=5025.64s)]
*  SuperGut, I have made up for my producer's fee [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDdjA4yJy88&t=5028.8s)]
