**All In Podcast:** [July 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4)
*  Love you guys. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=0.0s)]
*  Hey, if you guys are around, you know, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1.32s)]
*  and no one wants to get a glass of wine and some pasta. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Maybe we'll get a glass of wine later, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=7.44s)]
*  maybe next week or something, who knows? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=8.64s)]
*  Maybe we'll all get together in person [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  and have a glass of wine. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=11.52s)]
*  I see you soon. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=12.36s)]
*  I love you guys. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=13.4s)]
*  Ciao, ciao. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=14.56s)]
*  I love you besties, ciao. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=15.4s)]
*  You're about to come to Italy [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=18.28s)]
*  and basically you're gonna gain 15 pounds for sure. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=19.36s)]
*  Okay, so we were there in Italy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  This was a long time ago. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=24.92s)]
*  Is this when we were in Venice? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=25.76s)]
*  The quality of Italian white wine is outrageous. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=27.08s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=30.52s)]
*  It's outrageous. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=31.36s)]
*  Do they have a men's bikini for you [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=32.36s)]
*  for when we're in Italy? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  I would buy that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  Let's just say thank you to the amazing people of Italy [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=36.72s)]
*  for having the greatest country for adults [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=39.96s)]
*  to go on vacation in. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  What an incredible country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=44.76s)]
*  Here we go, in three, two, hey, ah, yeah. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Hey, everybody. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=52.2s)]
*  Someone's going through puberty. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  Hey, everybody, welcome. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=55.08s)]
*  Try it again. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=57.48s)]
*  Three, two, hey, everybody, welcome to another episode [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=58.68s)]
*  of the All In Podcast. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=61.04s)]
*  We are here in beautiful Portofino, Italy [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=63.44s)]
*  and we have found a new bestie. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=67.4s)]
*  Introduce yourself. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=69.2s)]
*  Natalie is your name? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  That is my name and you'll be surprised by my surname. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=71.48s)]
*  Ah, you've got a surname. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=74.8s)]
*  What is the surname? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=76.88s)]
*  Palliangritia. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=78.56s)]
*  No, sorry, Pallihapitiia. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=79.68s)]
*  Pallihapitiia, so you're cousins apparently [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=81.8s)]
*  and you run a biotech business, I understand, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=84.68s)]
*  here in Italy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  In my spare time. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=87.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  When somebody else doesn't consume the life out of me. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  Got it, okay, so you're dealing drugs in Italy [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  and welcome to the All In Pod. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=95.36s)]
*  In all seriousness, we are here in Italy [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=97.32s)]
*  because Chamath and Natalie got married. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=101.0s)]
*  Big round of applause. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=105.11999999999999s)]
*  Hey. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  Oh, very nice. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=107.32s)]
*  And we decided we'd tape an episode very quickly. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=108.8s)]
*  But tell us, what was it like at the wedding, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=113.08s)]
*  marrying Chamath Pallihapitiia? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=117.64s)]
*  Tell us about the wedding. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=119.92s)]
*  Woo. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=121.12s)]
*  It was a lot of work and Chamath was, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=122.4s)]
*  as you can expect, completely utterly useless. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=127.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=131.72s)]
*  We've seen this. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=132.56s)]
*  In fact, counterproductive. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=133.4s)]
*  He showed up now. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=135.6s)]
*  And at times really, really frustrating. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=136.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  But I love him nonetheless, so here we are. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=139.44s)]
*  I'm very happy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  This is the moment I would like to take credit [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=143.88000000000002s)]
*  for 30% of the wedding. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=145.68s)]
*  And then a number that you can't dispute, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  you don't really know what it means. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=150.0s)]
*  And then everybody ends up thanking you effusively [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  because they're like the 30% that they love the most. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=154.36s)]
*  That was me. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, if you want to make an estimate, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=157.4s)]
*  20, 30% chance is, you can't go wrong. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  Friedberg and Sachs are with us, the Don. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=161.32000000000002s)]
*  Sachs, you had a lot of clandestine meetings here. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=164.52s)]
*  Are we any closer to peace in Ukraine, Russia? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=167.32000000000002s)]
*  I saw you talking to some Russian emissaries. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  You've been on the continent for a full month. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=172.67999999999998s)]
*  Tell us. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=175.28s)]
*  How did you go for 12 hours yesterday, Sachs? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=176.11999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I know that you've been on some of these crazy yachts [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=177.64s)]
*  out here trying to broker peace. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=179.83999999999997s)]
*  How close are we? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=181.04s)]
*  And how are you enjoying your time in Europe this summer? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=181.88s)]
*  I don't think we're too close, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=184.76s)]
*  but let me say a word about this happy couple here. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=186.64s)]
*  So Natalie is brilliant and unstoppable. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=190.67999999999998s)]
*  Chamath is superficial and plastic. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=194.28s)]
*  So this was like the wedding of Oppenheimer and Barbie. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=196.72s)]
*  In that analogy, Chamath, you're Barbie. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=203.56s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=205.72s)]
*  Lots of substance and fire over here [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=207.24s)]
*  and complete narcissism in plastic over here. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=209.72s)]
*  Also the genitalia, the same size they can. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=212.92s)]
*  Very smoothed over, just barely a bump. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=215.64s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=218.52s)]
*  I'm gonna leave you guys at Georgia. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=220.4s)]
*  We'll do a show. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=221.96s)]
*  Natalie, congratulations. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=222.8s)]
*  We love you sister. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=224.92s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=225.94s)]
*  Thank you, J. Cal, because you celebrated our... [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=226.78s)]
*  Okay, that's enough. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=228.62s)]
*  Okay, here she goes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=229.46s)]
*  I wasn't talking about Chamath so clearly. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=230.3s)]
*  Oh yeah, you cut you off. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=232.06s)]
*  Oh, here we go, here we go. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=235.82000000000002s)]
*  What a great, great week we've had here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=237.38s)]
*  Lots of friends came in. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=240.9s)]
*  Lots of friends, lots of special friends. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=242.26000000000002s)]
*  Lots of poker. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  Lots of friends, lots of poker. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=245.26000000000002s)]
*  Lots of poker players that weren't invited to the wedding. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=246.86s)]
*  That weren't invited to the poker game. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=250.26000000000002s)]
*  I mean. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=252.54000000000002s)]
*  I mean, we walked into the poker game last night [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=253.38s)]
*  and there were all these guys [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=254.98s)]
*  that I didn't see at the wedding. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=256.02s)]
*  And you invited these guys. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=257.7s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=259.14s)]
*  To come to your poker game. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=259.98s)]
*  No, let's be honest. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=260.98s)]
*  But they didn't get invited to the wedding. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=261.82s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=262.66s)]
*  I think it was the most unbelievably eclectic guest list [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=263.5s)]
*  of any wedding that's ever happened. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=267.42s)]
*  That's very true. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=268.9s)]
*  I mean, literally it's like a two by two matrix of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=269.74s)]
*  villainy, wealth, fame, and infamy. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=273.5s)]
*  I mean, you had every quadrant covered. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=277.5s)]
*  It was incredible. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=279.94s)]
*  This guy and I were joking. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=280.78s)]
*  It's like walking into the bar on Tatooine. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=281.62s)]
*  It's like Star Wars. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=285.41999999999996s)]
*  It's got smoke and hookah in the corner. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=286.26s)]
*  We don't serve your guys. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=290.06s)]
*  People chained up. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=291.85999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it was a whole rigmarole last night. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=292.7s)]

*  which Shemagh told me, no holds barred, just go for it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=297.74s)]
*  My toast, he really meant roast. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=301.17999999999995s)]
*  Roast. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=302.97999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, he rushed it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=303.82s)]
*  The Italians did not get the jokes by the way. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=304.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so half the audience was laughing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=306.02s)]
*  The poker guys were laughing. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=308.5s)]
*  And then the family section, not laughing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=310.62s)]
*  I think a lot of them got the jokes [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=314.7s)]
*  and they were in on it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=316.54s)]

*  And just the hospitality in Italy is amazing. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=382.54s)]
*  One of my favorite places to come. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=386.18s)]
*  I just want to say to all of you guys [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=387.02000000000004s)]
*  and to all of our friends, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=388.54s)]
*  I mean, you guys literally flew halfway around the world [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=390.3s)]
*  for three days. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=393.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=394.54s)]
*  You did ruin all our summer plans. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=395.38s)]
*  I mean, it was incredible. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=396.22s)]
*  And frankly, we picked the three worst days, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=397.26s)]
*  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=399.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=401.14000000000004s)]
*  If you had a job. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=401.98s)]
*  Everybody had to work. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=402.82000000000005s)]
*  A certain person had two rooms rented at The Splendido [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=404.38s)]
*  just for meetings. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=407.14000000000004s)]
*  And he would just be running back meetings [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=407.98s)]
*  and then trying to go to the, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=409.3s)]
*  I mean, it's incredible. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=410.14000000000004s)]
*  You guys, it really means a lot to me. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=411.18s)]
*  I think this whole thing was a conspiracy [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=412.02000000000004s)]
*  to convene a high stakes poker game. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=413.90000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=415.46000000000004s)]
*  You knew you were spending the summer in Italy. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=416.3s)]
*  There was no poker here. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=418.3s)]
*  And you're like, how do I get the poker game to come [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=419.78000000000003s)]
*  to Italy? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=423.82000000000005s)]
*  He probably netted a profit to cover the wedding. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=424.66s)]
*  No, not to cover the wedding. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=427.1s)]
*  But I did win a $1.2 million pot from. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=428.58000000000004s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=431.70000000000005s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=432.54s)]
*  My favorite poker story is you got a call out of the blue. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=433.38s)]
*  Oh, the neighborhood. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=435.66s)]
*  It's the best. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=438.06s)]
*  Get a text. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=439.22s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=440.06s)]
*  Need rooms, spend it all. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=440.90000000000003s)]
*  I'd like two in the morning. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=442.74s)]
*  And I looked at my phone and I'm like, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=444.26000000000005s)]
*  why is texting me at two in the morning? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=446.22s)]
*  Need rooms, spend it all. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=448.58000000000004s)]
*  And I said, it's Jamath, is everything okay? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=449.54s)]
*  Do you need any help? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=451.46000000000004s)]
*  Need rooms, Splendido. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=452.58000000000004s)]
*  And I said, I'm not your travel coordinator. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=454.18s)]
*  And he goes, can you help me get a room at the Splendido [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=457.06s)]
*  hotel? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=458.94s)]
*  I said, what? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=459.26s)]
*  You're here? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=459.94s)]
*  So I said, well, why don't you just meander into our game? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=461.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=463.94s)]
*  And so actually came to the wedding. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=464.42s)]
*  Randomly in the neighborhood. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=466.22s)]
*  He was in the area. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=467.86s)]
*  Well, he was spending a night in so he thought he would hop [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=469.22s)]
*  over. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=471.18s)]
*  Hey. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=471.66s)]
*  Oh, hey. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=472.82s)]
*  Such a bad joke. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=474.86s)]
*  I saw that joke. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=476.66s)]
*  You stole it from me. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=477.78s)]
*  That's how it works in Hollywood. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=479.3s)]
*  There's a little backstory to all this. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=480.98s)]
*  What happened was Jamath told me in the spring, hey, listen, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=482.82s)]
*  I'm finally, I'm so excited. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=486.38s)]
*  I'm going to marry Nat. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=487.53999999999996s)]
*  And I said, oh, that's great. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=488.53999999999996s)]
*  You had the kids and now you're getting married. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=489.5s)]
*  It's not the traditional way to do it, but congratulations. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=491.82s)]
*  And he said, yeah, we're going to have like a little thing [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=494.65999999999997s)]
*  with our families in Italy. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=496.26s)]
*  Very bespoke. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=499.21999999999997s)]
*  The kids, parents, that's it. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=500.5s)]
*  And then back in Silicon Valley in the Bay Area, we'll have a [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=502.62s)]
*  backyard party for everybody else. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=505.82s)]
*  And I said, great. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=507.26s)]
*  Let me know where in Italy we're going. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=507.94s)]
*  And Nat said, amore. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=510.17999999999995s)]
*  It's just going to be the immediate family. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=512.18s)]
*  And I said, great. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=514.3s)]
*  Where am I going? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=514.98s)]
*  Tell me the location. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=515.82s)]

*  And then a week later, we get an email. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=520.9000000000001s)]
*  Nat and Jamath discussed it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=523.2600000000001s)]
*  And they said, you know what? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=525.1400000000001s)]
*  J-Cal's right. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=526.94s)]
*  We should invite everybody to Italy. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=527.58s)]
*  And so thanks for making that decision. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=529.0600000000001s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=532.34s)]
*  Thank you guys for coming. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=532.9000000000001s)]
*  Honestly, it was a dream. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=533.94s)]
*  We didn't tell anyone J-Cal was going to officiate. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=535.1800000000001s)]
*  So we're sitting there Italian style for like two hours [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=537.94s)]
*  assembling for the wedding. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=540.94s)]
*  Nothing happens. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=542.62s)]
*  You're all just standing around waiting for [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=543.5s)]
*  something to happen. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=545.14s)]
*  And then Jamath comes in. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=546.62s)]
*  Natalie comes in beautiful, dressed amazing. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=547.9399999999999s)]
*  Music is incredible. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=550.14s)]
*  And they sit there for another 10 minutes. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=551.66s)]
*  And they turn around and they say, the officiant, we just [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=553.9s)]
*  got a letter. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=555.98s)]
*  The officiant is sick. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=556.42s)]
*  We need someone to step in. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=557.9s)]
*  And then J-Cal pops up in the back. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=560.78s)]
*  I got it. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=562.6999999999999s)]
*  Knocks the Italian royalty to the right and the left. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=564.22s)]
*  Blows his way through the audience. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=567.1s)]
*  Makes his way to the top. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=568.62s)]
*  Pulls out his American bow tie or whatever he had and says, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=570.1s)]
*  let's do this. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=572.8199999999999s)]
*  And then we had J-Cal officiate for the wedding in a very [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=573.9399999999999s)]
*  J-Cal way. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=577.26s)]
*  Were you surprised? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=578.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I was surprised. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=579.22s)]
*  You were surprised. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=579.8199999999999s)]
*  A lot of people were surprised. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=580.78s)]
*  You got me. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=582.4599999999999s)]
*  Because your original email said, J-Cal is going to [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=583.5799999999999s)]
*  officiate. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=586.38s)]
*  But then we heard nothing for two and a half months. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=586.9399999999999s)]
*  And no one really knew. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=589.78s)]
*  And it was a big secret, right? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=591.34s)]
*  We kept it a big secret. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=592.74s)]
*  We wanted it to be a surprise. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=593.62s)]
*  And it was just the vows and the poetry that Natalie and [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=594.6999999999999s)]
*  Jamath shared was amazing. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=599.14s)]
*  Amore. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=602.3399999999999s)]
*  Amore. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=603.3399999999999s)]
*  Don't make her do that. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=604.3399999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=605.3399999999999s)]
*  You want to do that? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=606.3399999999999s)]
*  Can you do a dramatic reading of the poem that I wrote for [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=607.3399999999999s)]
*  you? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=609.18s)]
*  Oh. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=610.18s)]
*  This was a... [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=611.18s)]
*  Jamath wrote a poem. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=612.18s)]
*  But we'll do the setup that comes before. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=614.18s)]
*  So the setup was that Nat would read Jamath's poems and [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=617.66s)]
*  Jamath would read Nat's poems. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=623.26s)]
*  And so Nat had this incredible Paolo Quello poems, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=625.66s)]
*  incredibly well thought out. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=630.8199999999999s)]
*  And then Jamath wrote a poem from anonymous that he found at [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=632.26s)]
*  a rest stop on the 280 written on the inside of the bathroom [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=638.74s)]
*  stall. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=642.9s)]
*  Roses are red. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=643.7s)]
*  Violets are... [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=646.26s)]
*  No, go ahead. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=647.26s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=648.02s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=648.78s)]
*  You remember it? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=649.62s)]
*  You should have it committed to memory. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=650.26s)]
*  Let me think. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=652.46s)]
*  Roses are red. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=654.02s)]
*  Pickles are green. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=656.34s)]
*  I love your legs. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=659.14s)]
*  And what's in between? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=662.02s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=663.02s)]
*  It's embarrassing. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=664.02s)]
*  It was so embarrassing. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=665.5799999999999s)]
*  And she had to read this. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=666.86s)]
*  She literally just dropped it by her... [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=667.98s)]
*  It's one of all of the Italian aristocracy. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=669.14s)]
*  And the American... [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=671.26s)]
*  And the American... [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=672.26s)]
*  And the American's all rolled laughing. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=673.26s)]
*  Horrific. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=676.02s)]
*  It really was like a bar on Tattooine. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=677.02s)]
*  Her first poem was a sonnet from Malene Shakespeare. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=679.74s)]
*  My first poem was Beyonce's Cuffet. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=683.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=686.9399999999999s)]
*  Where the last line is, will you sit on top of me? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=687.9399999999999s)]
*  Which she has to say looking at her dad. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=690.34s)]
*  It was so awkward. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=693.1800000000001s)]
*  Then her second poem was something by Gregory Hoffman. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=695.0600000000001s)]
*  Who was it? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=700.5400000000001s)]
*  Gregory Hoffman, I think it was. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=701.94s)]
*  Something Hoffman. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=703.58s)]
*  And then mine was this anonymous thing. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=705.62s)]
*  And then her third was E Cummings and mine was Dr. Zeus. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=708.38s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's charming. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=710.86s)]
*  Dr. Zeus was nice. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=711.94s)]
*  Daniel Hoffman. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=713.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=714.6600000000001s)]
*  Well, we had a great time. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=715.1800000000001s)]
*  There's been a lot of news. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=716.0600000000001s)]
*  And Jackal, you got here early, right? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=717.14s)]
*  Weren't you like camping along the coastline? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=719.02s)]
*  Yes, I went to camp. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=721.0600000000001s)]
*  Went camping. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=723.34s)]
*  Decided to bring San Francisco to this beautiful, pristine... [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=724.74s)]
*  Yes, suffocating everywhere. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=728.26s)]
*  ...leaving a trail of needles in his wake. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=730.66s)]
*  Ozempic needles. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=732.98s)]
*  Wigoby. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=734.54s)]
*  Plastic trash. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=735.02s)]
*  He was trying to show that. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=736.82s)]
*  I did post a thirst trap. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=738.1s)]
*  I'm very proud. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=739.94s)]
*  I'm down 41 pounds from the peak. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=740.62s)]
*  20 pounds with hiking and using the fasting app [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=743.1s)]
*  that Kevin Rose built. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=747.14s)]
*  And then the other half, zero. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=748.1s)]
*  Great fasting app. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=750.42s)]
*  And the other half was Ozempic Wigoby. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=751.18s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=752.8199999999999s)]
*  What does an app do to help you fast? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=753.3s)]
*  Is it fast? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=754.78s)]
*  You click a button. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=755.78s)]
*  Do you eat the app? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=756.54s)]
*  It gives an animation and then it counts down the clock. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=757.38s)]
*  When you're trying to decide whether to eat or not, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=760.6999999999999s)]
*  you push a button, should I eat or not? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=762.46s)]
*  And it says no. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=763.8199999999999s)]
*  It shows you a picture of yourself. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=765.18s)]
*  Just a mirror. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=767.42s)]
*  A fat picture. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=768.02s)]
*  It shows you a fat picture of yourself. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=768.78s)]
*  That's what I did. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=770.9s)]
*  I took a picture of myself like Fat Jason. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=771.5s)]
*  And I just, every time I opened the refrigerator, it's there. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=773.5s)]
*  Can I ask you a question? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=776.4200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=777.1800000000001s)]
*  Are you not allowed to talk about like fatness now? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=778.1800000000001s)]
*  I have strong feelings on this. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=783.1800000000001s)]
*  I think when I ran marathons my whole life, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=785.34s)]
*  I was very svelte, 165 pounds until I was 32. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=789.3000000000001s)]
*  And then I added two or three pounds until you guys knew me. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=793.4200000000001s)]
*  And I hit 213 at my peak. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=796.1s)]
*  I'm 171 now. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=798.1s)]
*  172. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=799.74s)]
*  And I wish more people would have done an intervention. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=800.98s)]
*  You were very clear with me. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=805.5799999999999s)]
*  Hey, you got to lose weight. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=806.4599999999999s)]
*  We did a weight bag. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=807.38s)]
*  I have to tell. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=808.14s)]

*  I'm telling the story. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=811.9s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=812.98s)]

*  Now, this is your wedding present to me. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=814.66s)]
*  OK, thank you. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=816.66s)]
*  J Cal is bordering on morbidly obese. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=817.4599999999999s)]
*  This is when I was 213. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=821.4599999999999s)]
*  And your health goal? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=824.02s)]
*  5'9", on a good day. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=825.18s)]
*  5'8". [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=826.26s)]
*  On a good day. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=827.66s)]
*  By the way, for all these people on Twitter, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=828.42s)]
*  everybody who meets me always says, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=831.62s)]
*  oh, you look so much shorter on camera. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=833.6999999999999s)]
*  Maybe it's because I slouch. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=835.3399999999999s)]
*  But I'm six foot two, just in case everybody's curious. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=836.62s)]
*  On a good day. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=838.9399999999999s)]
*  Anyways, J Cal is bordering on morbidly obese. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=839.66s)]
*  So I make a weight bag with him. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=844.38s)]
*  Yeah, I was 213. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=845.9s)]
*  I said I can get to 193. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=846.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, 193. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=848.18s)]
*  And I was like, I'll give you 10K a pound or something. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=849.6999999999999s)]
*  Whatever, it's 100K bag. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=852.26s)]
*  It was a $100,000 bag. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=853.2199999999999s)]
*  And I hit it. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=855.5s)]
*  He had a year. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=856.38s)]
*  He had a year. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=857.18s)]
*  A year goes by. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=858.9s)]
*  I put it in my calendar. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=859.9s)]
*  And what I do is I schedule the poker game. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=861.54s)]
*  For the day before, knowing that we're [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=865.8199999999999s)]
*  going to play through midnight. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=868.42s)]
*  So I'm like, oh, I'm going to set this guy up. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=869.98s)]
*  So I waited a whole year. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=871.8199999999999s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=874.02s)]
*  We play poker. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=874.6999999999999s)]
*  The clock strikes midnight. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=875.9s)]
*  And he had been eating pizza and ice cream. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=877.3s)]
*  And I'm watching him the whole time. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=879.98s)]
*  I'm going to win this $100,000. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=881.5s)]
*  I never see a shrub like this. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=883.38s)]
*  And then I say, hey, it's time. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=884.9399999999999s)]
*  It's 1201. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=886.46s)]
*  It's time for the weight bag. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=887.26s)]
*  He says one weight bag. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=889.18s)]
*  And I said, motherfucker, you made a weight bag with me [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=890.7s)]
*  for $100,000 a year ago. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=893.06s)]
*  I have been 192, 193 for months. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=894.66s)]
*  I have hit the thing. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=898.06s)]
*  So he says he starts panicking. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=899.5799999999999s)]
*  Because I weigh myself in the morning. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=901.6999999999999s)]
*  He says he's panicking. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=903.3399999999999s)]
*  He says, OK, give me a few minutes. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=904.78s)]
*  He runs into my child's bedroom and takes a shit. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=906.9s)]
*  I just took a leak. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=910.74s)]
*  I took a leak. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=911.86s)]
*  He tried to lose the weight. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=912.9399999999999s)]
*  He tried to lose the weight. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=915.02s)]
*  Who can poo at midnight? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=916.86s)]
*  Nobody can poo at midnight. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=917.98s)]
*  Anyway, I get on the scale. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=919.26s)]
*  I'm 195. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=920.5s)]
*  And so he wants me to take all my clothes off. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=922.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm like, no, I'm not taking my clothes off. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=924.5s)]
*  I say, we have to do the weigh-in. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=926.02s)]
*  Now, in fairness to J. Cal, I did not [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=926.86s)]
*  pre-agree that I could pick the time. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=929.3s)]
*  So he says, I have until midnight. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=932.98s)]
*  Which is true. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=934.9s)]
*  So I said, OK, fine. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=935.7s)]
*  He goes home. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=937.7s)]
*  Goes home. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=938.46s)]
*  I go in the sauna. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=938.98s)]
*  He does not eat. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=939.7s)]
*  He puts on a sweatsuit. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=940.7s)]
*  I go for a run. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=942.22s)]
*  I'm like, rocky around San Francisco. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=942.9s)]
*  He sweats for four hours. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=944.58s)]
*  He gets like a tenth of a pound under before midnight. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=946.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=949.74s)]
*  And then he's like, you owe me $100,000. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=950.26s)]
*  No. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=951.78s)]
*  But then he was kind. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=951.82s)]
*  He said, look, put me in the mini one for one drop, $100,000. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=953.06s)]
*  The one drop. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=957.06s)]
*  And we'll both go. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=957.66s)]
*  And we'll chop it up. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=958.5799999999999s)]
*  And we'll pull it. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=958.8599999999999s)]
*  We'll chop it up. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=959.6999999999999s)]
*  We had a great time. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=960.14s)]
*  And J. Cal lost in the first eight hands. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=960.6999999999999s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=962.5s)]
*  I lasted longer than you. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=963.2199999999999s)]
*  $100,000. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=964.3399999999999s)]
*  I should have just leave it. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=965.9399999999999s)]
*  Burn it. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=967.3s)]
*  OK, back to you. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=968.14s)]
*  But that was a weight-pud story. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=968.8199999999999s)]
*  But I would say, in terms of weight, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=970.0999999999999s)]
*  it is pernicious in America. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=972.26s)]
*  I don't think we should be celebrating it [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=974.2199999999999s)]
*  or tolerating it. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=975.9799999999999s)]
*  I think we should be compassionate. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=977.06s)]
*  I think Ozempic and Wigovie are incredible tools. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=978.4599999999999s)]
*  And Manjaro. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=981.98s)]
*  I didn't talk about it for the first year. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=984.22s)]
*  David, you've done it as well. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=985.74s)]
*  And you've been honest that you've tried Wigovie or whatever. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=986.74s)]
*  And you lost a lot of weight. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=988.98s)]
*  So congratulations. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=990.14s)]
*  These guys have been skinny forever. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=991.38s)]
*  But I think, take it seriously. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=993.4200000000001s)]
*  It takes a lot of discipline. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=996.54s)]
*  But it can be done. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=999.22s)]
*  And I encourage people. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1000.26s)]
*  The gains I've gotten from being 40 pounds lighter [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1002.54s)]
*  have been tremendous. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1005.54s)]
*  I feel great. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1006.94s)]
*  My energy level is different. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1007.62s)]
*  My thinking is different. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1009.34s)]
*  My sleep's better. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1010.46s)]
*  Everything's great. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1011.1800000000001s)]
*  So I just want to be around for a long time [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1011.94s)]
*  so that we can do 1,000 episodes of the show for you [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1013.9000000000001s)]
*  and the fans. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1016.1s)]
*  And yeah, being fat sucks. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1017.5400000000001s)]
*  The end. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1019.7s)]
*  And if you've suffered from it. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1021.3000000000001s)]
*  But do you think it's being normalized? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1022.58s)]
*  And do you think that that's healthy? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1024.66s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1026.02s)]
*  I think. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1027.7s)]
*  Write into the microphone. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1028.74s)]
*  No one chooses obesity. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1029.74s)]
*  Obesity is a struggle. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1034.18s)]
*  Just like diabetes. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1035.38s)]
*  No one chooses diabetes. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1036.54s)]
*  Diabetes is a struggle. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1037.9s)]
*  I've done some work, made some investments, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1039.42s)]
*  and on the board of some companies [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1041.86s)]
*  that have been involved in trying to address [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1042.82s)]
*  the needs in this space. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1044.78s)]
*  And one of the things that we've learned a lot about [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1046.4599999999998s)]
*  is how much of a social stigma it feels. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1048.8999999999999s)]
*  People that are struggling with obesity [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1051.2199999999998s)]
*  and struggling with diabetes don't feel comfortable [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1052.8999999999999s)]
*  actively talking about it. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1054.82s)]
*  Because they hold a deep amount of shame about it. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1056.1399999999999s)]
*  They recognize that there's something deeply unhealthy [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1058.86s)]
*  about it. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1061.02s)]
*  And they feel deep shame because they're often portrayed [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1061.9399999999998s)]
*  as having the choice and making the decisions that [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1065.6999999999998s)]
*  got them to this point. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1068.4599999999998s)]
*  And the truth is, we live in a world with extraordinary [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1069.9s)]
*  abundance in the first world. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1072.8200000000002s)]
*  We live in a world with extraordinary opportunities [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1074.42s)]
*  for low cost calorie consumption. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1076.42s)]
*  We find a lot of joy in our lifestyles. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1078.5s)]
*  And ultimately, living a happy life [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1081.7800000000002s)]
*  can lead people to a very sad place. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1085.1000000000001s)]
*  And so generally, I would say that this is not something [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1088.02s)]
*  that should be stigmatized in an open way. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1091.42s)]
*  It should be treated with compassion, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1094.8600000000001s)]
*  but it should be spoken about openly. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1096.3400000000001s)]
*  Which is that there is a challenge and a struggle [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1097.94s)]
*  that people have, and we need to help. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1100.3s)]
*  And everyone needs to be cognizant of the fact. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1102.66s)]
*  And that's the thing we need to shift here. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1104.6200000000001s)]
*  I think we're normalizing it, and I think it's wrong. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1106.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1108.5800000000002s)]
*  When I first came to Canada, you see the pictures [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1109.3400000000001s)]
*  when I was fresh off the boat. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1112.1000000000001s)]
*  That's what we used to call immigrants. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1114.18s)]
*  I was real thin skinny. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1116.14s)]
*  Real thin. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1118.46s)]
*  And then after a year of eating whatever food [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1119.78s)]
*  it was that we could afford, I became really fat. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1122.3s)]
*  And you could see it in the pictures. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1125.06s)]
*  When I was fat, all through my grade school, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1126.46s)]
*  I was a little skinny, but skinny fat in the face, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1129.9s)]
*  but basically fat all through high school. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1132.46s)]
*  And then I finally started working out [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1134.9s)]
*  and taking care of myself. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1136.22s)]
*  And it had a huge impact on my self-esteem [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1137.78s)]
*  and my self-confidence. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1140.06s)]
*  It had a huge impact on my health. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1141.22s)]
*  I saw it basically kill my father. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1143.74s)]
*  It's given 11 of my aunts and uncles diabetes. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1145.42s)]
*  So I think that all of this normalization is unhealthy, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1148.8600000000001s)]
*  because it actually is killing people. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1152.3400000000001s)]
*  What I learned from the dieting is portion control in America [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1155.22s)]
*  is just out of control. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1159.5s)]
*  It is the wrong portion sizes. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1161.18s)]
*  So you see it here, and you see it here. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1163.5s)]
*  When you eat here, here's a little tuna. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1165.78s)]
*  Here's a small pasta. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1167.9s)]
*  Here's some cheese and some grapes for dessert. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1170.14s)]
*  You're done. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1172.38s)]
*  And so once I got my portion control, I was fine. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1173.18s)]
*  Snacking also. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1175.82s)]
*  But I just wish anybody who's suffering from it, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1176.98s)]
*  work with your doctors, work with nutritionists. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1179.38s)]
*  You were overweight too for a long time. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1181.22s)]
*  Were you? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1182.8600000000001s)]
*  Free-bred? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1184.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1184.94s)]
*  What were you overweight from? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1186.46s)]
*  I grew up not eating well. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1187.86s)]
*  I was overweight in college. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1189.7s)]
*  Right in the microphone. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1191.5s)]
*  College is when I really started to get exercise actively. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1192.18s)]
*  It was never part of my upbringing as a kid, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1196.26s)]
*  was eat well, get exercise. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1198.9s)]
*  I was very much self-taught at learning how to cook [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1201.5s)]
*  and learned a lot about nutrition on my own. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1203.54s)]
*  And look, I took action on my own in my early 20s. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1206.94s)]
*  But yeah, look, it's so easy to not [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1211.82s)]
*  know where you find yourself. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1213.78s)]
*  And then you find yourself in this place. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1214.8999999999999s)]
*  And I do agree that being cognizant of where you are [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1216.66s)]
*  and addressing it in an open way, in an active way, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1220.82s)]
*  is the only path. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1223.42s)]
*  I mean, it's just every cycle we come around [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1224.26s)]
*  with some new, easy solution. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1226.94s)]
*  You guys remember the, what was it? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1229.66s)]
*  Fenfen? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1231.7s)]
*  Fenfen. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1232.74s)]
*  Fenfen. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1233.22s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta be careful with that one. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1233.74s)]
*  Yeah, that was speed. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1234.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1235.62s)]
*  And so look, I mean, the data so far [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1236.1s)]
*  looks great with these GLP. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1237.66s)]
*  Clip ones. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1241.26s)]
*  These drugs seem to be very effective. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1242.46s)]
*  There's some data now that shows as soon as you stop taking it, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1244.46s)]
*  the average person on it gains the weight right back. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1247.0600000000002s)]
*  No, that didn't happen for me. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1249.66s)]
*  Increased muscle mass. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1250.8600000000001s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1252.22s)]
*  But across a large population, there's [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1252.74s)]
*  just data that's showing that there's never [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1255.3000000000002s)]
*  going to be an easy path. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1257.3400000000001s)]
*  And it's a very difficult thing. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1258.46s)]
*  It's a process. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1261.02s)]
*  You know, the thing I learned is if you just [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1261.9s)]
*  have one Oreo a day or every other day, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1265.1000000000001s)]
*  let's say that's 50 calories, you [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1269.0600000000002s)]
*  have one of those every other day. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1270.5s)]
*  You're going to get two pounds a year for 20 years. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1271.5s)]
*  Now you're 40 pounds overweight. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1273.18s)]
*  It happens very slowly, you add it. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1274.5s)]
*  And then you just have to be super disciplined. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1275.98s)]
*  And you can lose a half a pound or a pound a week. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1277.82s)]
*  And then it can come off. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1280.18s)]
*  So I really think it should be a movement in the United States. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1281.18s)]
*  So much of our downstream issues, diabetes, heart, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1284.98s)]
*  disease, cancer, et cetera, seem to be contributed by obesity. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1289.06s)]
*  So I think for the entire country, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1293.1s)]
*  I think if I ran for president, it [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1297.02s)]
*  would be Wigovia for everybody. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1299.5s)]
*  Everybody who wants it. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1301.8600000000001s)]
*  There you have it. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1302.8600000000001s)]
*  There you have it. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1303.38s)]
*  Wigovia is my platform. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1304.38s)]
*  Single issue voters. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1305.26s)]
*  There's a platform you can vote for. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1306.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1307.54s)]
*  Single issue platform. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1308.06s)]
*  All right. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1309.38s)]
*  Get in shape. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1309.9s)]
*  There's some news, I think, we can touch on. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1310.8600000000001s)]
*  Zach, how you feeling? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1313.66s)]
*  I got a plane to catch. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1314.74s)]
*  Let's do this. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1315.66s)]
*  So there was an article in Vice, I guess, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1316.3s)]
*  that name checked the All In podcast. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1318.66s)]
*  It said young people, instead of wanting [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1320.82s)]
*  to become McKinsey consultants, now [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1323.3s)]
*  want to become members of the All In podcast [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1325.9s)]
*  and be venture capitalists. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1328.06s)]
*  I did a little tweet storm that I thought, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1329.18s)]
*  and I thought it'd be a great topic for us. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1331.94s)]
*  I think for young people, going into venture early [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1333.74s)]
*  is not a good idea. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1336.78s)]
*  I think, generally speaking, 80% of the cases. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1338.02s)]
*  And I think starting your own company [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1342.18s)]
*  or joining a high growth company or maybe [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1345.02s)]
*  joining a well-run large company or even joining a poorly run [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1348.38s)]
*  large company so you learn what not to do [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1353.22s)]
*  are all better things to do in your 20s. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1355.18s)]
*  Learn, be in the trenches. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1357.8999999999999s)]
*  But I'm curious what you think, Zach, about this issue. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1359.9799999999998s)]
*  Because we came to venture and investing in our 40s, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1363.34s)]
*  I believe, both of us angel investors and then [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1367.02s)]
*  both of us having fun. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1369.3799999999999s)]
*  So what are you advising a young person who's [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1370.3799999999999s)]
*  listening to the podcast coming out of business school, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1372.62s)]
*  whatever? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1374.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with that. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1375.9799999999998s)]
*  I think the main value prop that a VC has to offer a founder [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1377.26s)]
*  is advice. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1382.54s)]
*  And if you've never walked in the founder's shoes before, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1384.1s)]
*  if you've never founded a company or at least had [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1387.5s)]
*  a significant operating role, how are you in a position [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1389.46s)]
*  to offer them advice? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1392.34s)]
*  Now, I think there was a period of time [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1394.14s)]
*  during the bull market where people stopped thinking [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1396.06s)]
*  that way, stopped thinking that advice was the model. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1399.66s)]
*  VCs started competing on the basis [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1402.62s)]
*  of who could be the biggest cheerleader for the founder, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1404.46s)]
*  who could offer the most positive emotional support. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1407.46s)]
*  Largest valuation. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1410.7s)]
*  Or the biggest valuation or least governance. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1412.14s)]
*  The idea of being completely passive, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1414.7s)]
*  not taking a board seat was actually sold to founders [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1416.3s)]
*  as a positive for them that like, we'll invest [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1419.78s)]
*  and we'll just like stay completely out of the way. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1422.3799999999999s)]
*  And all of those ideas sounded really good [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1425.58s)]
*  when the market was booming and everything [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1428.18s)]
*  was up and to the right. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1430.46s)]
*  But now we're in a situation in which we're [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1431.46s)]
*  going through two years of intense turmoil. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1433.8999999999999s)]
*  And a lot of companies aren't going to make it. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1436.82s)]
*  A lot of companies are restructuring. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1439.22s)]
*  A lot of companies are going to take down rounds. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1441.26s)]
*  And actually being able to tap your board for advice [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1443.26s)]
*  on how to get through a rough patch [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1446.54s)]
*  actually is pretty important. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1448.9s)]
*  You realize now that the uninvolved passive investor, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1450.22s)]
*  that was not a positive value prop. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1454.78s)]
*  That was an excuse for not having a value prop. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1457.5s)]
*  And I think at times like this, it's [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1460.74s)]
*  really important to have VCs who've been around the block, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1462.54s)]
*  who saw the last downturn, who ideally could have warned you [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1466.58s)]
*  that it was coming. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1470.5s)]
*  Just like we did on this pod for 18 months. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1471.82s)]
*  Like we did repeatedly for a year. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1473.5s)]
*  18 months, yeah. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1474.98s)]
*  And so yeah, I think that we're now seeing the correction. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1476.3799999999999s)]
*  And I firmly agree with your analysis [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1480.46s)]
*  that there are too many people who [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1482.3799999999999s)]
*  joined the ranks of VC who firmly didn't have a value [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1484.7s)]
*  prop. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1487.06s)]
*  And that's why, I mean, at our firm, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1487.54s)]
*  we require that everyone who joins the investment team [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1488.9399999999998s)]
*  have operating experience and ideally founder experience. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1491.1399999999999s)]
*  Because that is ultimately what you're going to offer founders. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1494.3s)]
*  Shamath was too much of this people [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1497.98s)]
*  larping live action role playing VC with just absolutely no idea [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1500.54s)]
*  how this works. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1505.98s)]
*  And now what happens to those actor or VCs [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1506.74s)]
*  who really are faced with portfolios that are upside down? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1511.38s)]
*  And they really have no idea how to weather a storm. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1516.18s)]
*  This has been a hard 18 months. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1518.9s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1520.22s)]
*  Well, I think that it was a symptom of just the fact [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1521.26s)]
*  that there was a lot of free money in the system. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1523.98s)]
*  And I don't know, the outcome is going to be pretty basic, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1526.74s)]
*  which is that they're going to lose money [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1529.38s)]
*  for their limited partners. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1532.02s)]
*  And those limited partners, if they're not totally stupid, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1533.5s)]
*  will never give these people money again. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1536.5s)]
*  And these people will need to just find a new job. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1538.74s)]
*  And I don't say that in a celebratory way. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1541.08s)]
*  It's just a very practical ones and zeros monetary assessment [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1542.94s)]
*  of the facts. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1546.74s)]
*  Look, I think that the weird thing that has happened [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1548.38s)]
*  is that it became like this kind of fun thing [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1552.06s)]
*  to be able to say you were doing. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1554.34s)]
*  A lot of people used to moonlight and do it on the side. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1555.7s)]
*  Then there were all these services [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1558.46s)]
*  that will allow you to basically abstract the job. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1559.82s)]
*  But the only thing that I would just qualify your statement, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1562.6200000000001s)]
*  because I think what you're saying is like 90% right. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1565.78s)]
*  But I don't think that's where the craziest outcome returns [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1569.54s)]
*  have come from. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1573.7s)]
*  Because if you look at the two people that are really, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1574.7s)]
*  or the three people that have really generated just [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1576.54s)]
*  gargantuan home run returns on a consistent basis, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1578.6200000000001s)]
*  one of them, for example, like Mike Moritz, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1581.94s)]
*  really didn't have those bona fides operationally. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1583.9s)]
*  But I think that what Mike probably has, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1588.5800000000002s)]
*  and I'm saying this not knowing him, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1591.3400000000001s)]
*  is a preternatural judge of psychology, I think. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1592.8200000000002s)]
*  I think he's an incredibly qualified people judge. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1596.8600000000001s)]
*  And there are people like that. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1600.02s)]
*  Now, he's an outlier in order to do that. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1601.3400000000001s)]
*  But the rest of us have to kind of, to your point, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1604.5400000000002s)]
*  do with what we have, which is like, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1607.14s)]
*  here's our experience and our maturity. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1608.7800000000002s)]
*  And we're telling you what we think. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1611.02s)]
*  So I'm really excited, actually, for this wave [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1612.94s)]
*  to kind of crash on shore. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1615.42s)]
*  Because the number of founders that [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1617.06s)]
*  are going to get screwed over by folks that [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1619.06s)]
*  don't know what they're talking about, it's very high. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1621.1000000000001s)]
*  And that needs to come to an end as quickly as possible. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1623.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it's just Mike Moritz. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1626.22s)]
*  I think that there's a class of successful venture capitalists. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1628.3s)]
*  Bill Gurley is a great example. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1632.5800000000002s)]
*  He was an analyst. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1634.5s)]
*  Danny Reimer at Index Ventures was an investment analyst. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1635.22s)]
*  Fred Wilson. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1638.7s)]
*  Fred Wilson. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1640.22s)]
*  Yeah, a lifetime VC. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1640.94s)]
*  And Moritz John Doar. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1642.34s)]
*  I mean, John Doar had some experience. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1643.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he worked at Intel. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1645.74s)]
*  But there are folks who have an incredible analytical capacity. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1647.26s)]
*  And that analytical capacity translates [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1652.02s)]
*  into incredible selection capability. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1654.06s)]
*  That selection doesn't necessarily [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1656.86s)]
*  mean that they are going to necessarily be the best [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1659.1799999999998s)]
*  advisors. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1661.4199999999998s)]
*  And I'm not saying that any of those folks are bad advisors. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1661.98s)]
*  But there are some venture investors, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1664.62s)]
*  like Founders Fund is very vocal about this [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1666.22s)]
*  and very public about this, that their objective is not [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1668.1399999999999s)]
*  to be your partner in helping you make decisions and run [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1671.1s)]
*  your company and recruit people and all the other sort [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1673.54s)]
*  of rigmarole that many VCs go out and tout. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1676.02s)]
*  They are there to pick the best founders. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1679.06s)]
*  And the best founders don't need the VC to be successful. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1681.78s)]
*  And their job then is to have incredible selection capacity. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1685.3s)]
*  So if they can select the best founders [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1688.5s)]
*  and get out of their way, they've made a lot of money. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1690.1799999999998s)]
*  And their returns are unbelievable. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1692.6599999999999s)]
*  And then there are some VCs who are really incredible partners [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1695.1399999999999s)]
*  to their founders. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1698.62s)]
*  And their objective, Josh Copeland at first round, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1699.7s)]
*  built an entire firm around this practice, which [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1701.78s)]
*  is to partner very closely with founders [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1704.26s)]
*  and to build support and capabilities. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1705.98s)]
*  And recent Horowitz was built on the same sort of concept [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1707.9s)]
*  that they would roll all of their fees [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1711.1000000000001s)]
*  into building operating support and capacity to support founders [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1712.94s)]
*  and support companies. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1716.02s)]
*  Both firms have obviously done well in their own right. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1717.18s)]
*  And so I don't know if there's necessarily [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1720.1000000000001s)]
*  one breed that predicts success when it comes [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1721.82s)]
*  to successful venture capital. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1724.02s)]
*  I will say from my own personal experience, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1725.46s)]
*  I worked as an investment banker for my first two years [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1727.22s)]
*  out of undergrad. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1729.22s)]
*  I had a science background. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1731.7s)]
*  I worked in a short-stint in private equity. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1732.9s)]
*  I worked at Google. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1735.02s)]
*  I did CorpDev and M&A there. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1735.8600000000001s)]
*  I started a company, ran it, sold it, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1737.54s)]
*  did that with another business where I was on the board. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1740.46s)]
*  So I've been on a couple of different places [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1742.74s)]
*  around the table that I think have given me [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1745.74s)]
*  the ability to provide advice. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1748.5s)]
*  I don't know if I necessarily have the same skill set [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1750.94s)]
*  that the team at Founders Fund and Mike Moritz and others [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1753.66s)]
*  might have at this astute extraordinary ability [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1757.6s)]
*  to spot founders and bring them in. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1760.3999999999999s)]
*  So I think everyone needs to kind of recognize [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1762.52s)]
*  what they do bring to the table, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1764.0s)]
*  be very clear about what that is. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1764.9599999999998s)]
*  And I think to your point, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1766.9199999999998s)]
*  there has just been an incredible bull market [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1768.28s)]
*  over the last 15 years. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1770.1599999999999s)]
*  Since 2008, more money has, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1771.32s)]
*  I heard an incredible statistic, by the way. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1773.32s)]
*  I don't want to get it wrong, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1775.9599999999998s)]
*  so maybe we should fact check me after this [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1776.8799999999999s)]
*  from someone at your wedding, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1778.84s)]
*  who I was talking to for a long time. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1780.7199999999998s)]
*  And he was like, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1782.52s)]
*  basically the top 1% of VCs [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1784.6799999999998s)]
*  didn't beat what would have happened [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1787.6s)]
*  if you just bought the top five public tech companies [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1789.6s)]
*  and effectively did a rebalance over the past 15 years. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1791.9199999999998s)]
*  The bull market and the aggregation of value in technology [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1795.4399999999998s)]
*  has largely been 50-50 to public and private. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1799.1599999999999s)]
*  So you could have just bought a few stocks [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1801.6799999999998s)]
*  and held onto them and beat all of the VCs [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1803.52s)]
*  over the last 15 years, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1806.3s)]
*  even though a bunch of VCs have made good money [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1807.58s)]
*  and their IRR looks like 12%, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1809.0s)]
*  but you have to beat them. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1810.76s)]
*  The risk adjusted returns on venture. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1811.6s)]
*  And this is not to throw shade at even all of those people [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1814.68s)]
*  that you mentioned are fucking terrible. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1817.0s)]
*  Like you should not have invested in any of those [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1819.68s)]
*  because there's no way to ton it in any of those funds [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1822.36s)]
*  because you get a small allocation, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1824.76s)]
*  one fund does well, three funds do crappy. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1826.48s)]
*  Over the past 10 years, or 15 years, I forgot the number, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1829.32s)]
*  we've seen the public market cap [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1832.52s)]
*  of these top tech companies grow [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1834.94s)]
*  from one trillion to 10 trillion. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1836.72s)]
*  That's a 10X. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1839.12s)]
*  So all you had to do was buy those [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1840.44s)]
*  and you would have made 10X [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1841.8s)]
*  and that works out to north of 25% IRR. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1842.64s)]
*  And there's very few VCs that have been able [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1845.48s)]
*  to beat 25% IRR. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1847.0s)]
*  They assume now, he was telling me his model shows [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1848.64s)]
*  that over the next 10 years, it'll be roughly 70, 30. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1850.8000000000002s)]
*  So it'll be about 30% will accrue. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1854.4s)]
*  And they think over the next 10 years, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1856.0s)]
*  it's gonna go from 10 trillion to 25 trillion, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1857.24s)]
*  which is still a great return. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1859.88s)]
*  Just to build on this. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1861.0400000000002s)]
*  But it shows how much of a hurdle there is in venture [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1861.88s)]
*  to be successful. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1863.44s)]
*  I started the business in 2011, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1864.2800000000002s)]
*  so now this is the 12th or 13th year. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1865.8400000000001s)]
*  Just how hard this game is. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1868.5200000000002s)]
*  I had about a 31, 32% gross IRR going into last year. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1870.8400000000001s)]
*  And then my IRR fell off a cliff [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1877.24s)]
*  because I couldn't get into, obviously there's like, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1878.64s)]
*  there's no money to distribute. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1880.24s)]
*  But there's nothing to distribute, yeah. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1881.44s)]
*  So my IRR start to decay. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1882.4s)]
*  And then I had this really, really fucked up choice. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1885.2s)]
*  I have to start selling stuff earlier [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1887.64s)]
*  than I would have otherwise to get the money back out. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1889.44s)]
*  So to your point. Right. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1891.64s)]
*  Now it takes courage. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1892.64s)]
*  Then it's a really tough game over long periods of time. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1893.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1898.0s)]
*  It's a really tough game. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1898.84s)]
*  I think there's also something going on, you know, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1899.8799999999999s)]
*  in the United States and society [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1902.3999999999999s)]
*  where there are some idealized jobs. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1903.9599999999998s)]
*  We talked about SAACs, elites, surplus elites. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1905.3999999999999s)]
*  And I want to dovetail this with what's happening [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1909.32s)]
*  in Hollywood, the writer's strike and the actor's strike. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1911.1999999999998s)]
*  And I was looking at it, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1914.9199999999998s)]
*  there's some unbelievable number of actors in SAACs, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1915.84s)]
*  some unbelievable number of writers. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1918.9599999999998s)]
*  They all make just incredibly small amounts of money [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1920.56s)]
*  on average. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1924.56s)]
*  And obviously there's some big fish who do well, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1925.48s)]
*  but it does seem like there's too many people [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1928.12s)]
*  who want too many of these idealized jobs. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1931.8s)]
*  And venture is one of those. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1935.04s)]
*  And I just would like young people to understand also, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1937.7199999999998s)]
*  be careful what you wish for. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1940.52s)]
*  This job has seemed easy, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1942.1999999999998s)]
*  just like it might seem easy for Tom Cruise [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1944.28s)]
*  or Christopher Nolan. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1946.56s)]
*  When you see them or Tarantino, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1947.8799999999999s)]
*  what you don't see is all of the people [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1949.8799999999999s)]
*  who tried to become Tarantino, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1951.6799999999998s)]
*  who tried to become, you know, Tom Cruise. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1953.3999999999999s)]
*  And there are far too- [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1956.32s)]
*  Spent 10 to 15 years before they realized that they're not. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1957.64s)]
*  And they did not actually have the fundamental skills [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1959.8400000000001s)]
*  or the work ethic that is required to become Tarantino. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1963.3600000000001s)]
*  I listened to Tarantino's podcast. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1966.6000000000001s)]
*  He does a, have you heard the video archives podcast yet? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1968.28s)]
*  You have to get on this. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1971.0400000000002s)]
*  It's him and his, the co-writer of, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1972.3200000000002s)]
*  who did you write Pulp Fiction with? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1975.16s)]
*  Roger Avery. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1976.24s)]
*  Roger Avery. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1977.0800000000002s)]
*  So him and Roger Avery, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1977.92s)]
*  this is my favorite podcast right now. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1978.76s)]
*  They just talk about films. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1980.44s)]
*  Their knowledge of films is so unbelievable. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1981.96s)]
*  And the detail in which they talk about that is so crisp. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1987.2s)]
*  They finish each other's sentences [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1992.28s)]
*  in the way with maybe you listen to this podcast, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1993.76s)]
*  you know, we all go, oh, John Doar. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1996.5600000000002s)]
*  Oh no, he worked at Intel. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1998.3200000000002s)]
*  Oh, this person, yeah, Maritz. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=1999.28s)]
*  He was a journalist. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2000.76s)]
*  We have a deep, deep understanding of this business [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2002.0s)]
*  that comes from 30 years within it or 20 years. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2004.92s)]
*  And I think you have to, I know it sounds corny, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2008.0s)]
*  but you have to pay your dues. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2011.0s)]
*  You have to put 60, 70 hours in a week [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2012.76s)]
*  to get that elite job. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2015.28s)]
*  And the problem today, I feel is, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2017.8799999999999s)]
*  and for people who are listening, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2019.48s)]
*  who are young people coming out of schools, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2020.52s)]
*  if you're not willing to sacrifice 60, 70, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2022.36s)]
*  80 hours a week for a decade or two, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2024.92s)]
*  you're just not going to be successful in that career. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2027.12s)]
*  And young people push back on this. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2030.1599999999999s)]
*  And I think the simplest way to reframe it [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2031.96s)]
*  is in the following. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2034.8s)]
*  Do you really think, for example, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2036.56s)]
*  let's pick NBA basketball. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2038.6s)]
*  Do you think you would be really interested [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2041.52s)]
*  or find credible that the best player in the NBA [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2043.84s)]
*  only practiced three hours a week? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2047.08s)]
*  Does that happen? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2049.88s)]
*  Impossible. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2050.84s)]
*  Or do you think they're practicing three hours [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2051.68s)]
*  in the morning and then also three hours in the afternoon [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2052.64s)]
*  and they give up their lives? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2054.84s)]
*  The most incredible thing that I saw in the NBA [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2056.16s)]
*  was all of these men literally gave up their life [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2058.04s)]
*  to play that game, to perfect it. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2062.08s)]
*  And that's true for anything. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2064.08s)]
*  And so I don't understand how, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2066.6s)]
*  whether if you're a filmmaker, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2068.04s)]
*  whether you want to be an investor, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2069.2799999999997s)]
*  whether you want to be an athlete, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2070.56s)]
*  whether you want to be an actor, a surgeon, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2071.8s)]
*  it's just like, it's an immutable law of physics. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2074.92s)]
*  So just get over it, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2077.36s)]
*  which is you need to put in tens of thousands of hours. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2079.0s)]
*  And if you cannot or won't, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2082.36s)]
*  you should not expect the success [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2085.2400000000002s)]
*  and you should not complain. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2087.32s)]
*  And also, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2088.92s)]
*  because it's not free. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2089.88s)]
*  Yeah, these guys, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2091.1200000000003s)]
*  Do you agree with that or not? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2092.36s)]
*  Yeah, look, I mean, LeBron, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2093.2000000000003s)]
*  what was it 2016 when they came back and won in game seven? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2095.0400000000004s)]
*  2016? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2097.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't want to go back. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2098.5200000000004s)]
*  That's one bad scar tissue. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2099.36s)]
*  But the next day, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2100.96s)]
*  his teammates go out and celebrate. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2103.84s)]
*  You know what LeBron did on Instagram the next day? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2105.08s)]
*  Posted a photo at 7 a.m. of himself in the gym. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2107.2000000000003s)]
*  Working out. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2109.88s)]
*  But look, one thing I'll say, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2111.2400000000002s)]
*  LeBron knows what his skill is [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2112.48s)]
*  and he knows what his game is. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2113.88s)]
*  I think every individual needs to figure out [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2115.52s)]
*  what their skill is and what their game is [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2118.4s)]
*  and not to find glory [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2120.6s)]
*  in what others have found to be their skill and their game. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2122.88s)]
*  That there is something that comes from [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2125.96s)]
*  mastering any craft that gives an individual joy [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2128.56s)]
*  and purpose in life. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2131.44s)]
*  And you see this in basketball. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2132.72s)]
*  You see it when these athletes really find what they love [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2134.12s)]
*  and they do it and they commit to it. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2136.16s)]
*  And there are things that we each have realized [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2138.08s)]
*  we are good at and there are things [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2139.88s)]
*  that we've all certainly realized we are not good at. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2141.04s)]
*  And identifying that and mastering one's craft [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2143.44s)]
*  is the key to any person being successful and happy, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2145.72s)]
*  I believe. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2148.2s)]
*  Versus just assuming that there's a thing out there [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2149.04s)]
*  that everyone makes money at. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2151.68s)]
*  Distraction alert. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2152.52s)]
*  All of our wives are about to go swimming. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2153.48s)]

*  Woo. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2159.9199999999996s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2160.7599999999998s)]
*  God almighty I hit the jackpot. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2161.6s)]
*  It's beauty and the beast. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2163.52s)]
*  You can relate. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2164.3599999999997s)]
*  Huh? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2165.2s)]
*  Chamath. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2166.04s)]
*  The way I look at it. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2166.8799999999997s)]
*  We were joking at breakfast today. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2168.72s)]
*  We were like, my wife must have low self-esteem [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2170.3999999999996s)]
*  because she's married to me. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2172.2799999999997s)]
*  Sac said the best line. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2173.3599999999997s)]
*  He's like, if you Google Nathalie Dompay, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2174.6s)]
*  you'll find this picture of her holding a tiger, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2177.3599999999997s)]
*  a lion by the tail. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2180.6s)]
*  Which is a lot more exciting [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2182.9599999999996s)]
*  than holding a Sri Lankan by the schlong. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2183.9599999999996s)]
*  It's a great line. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2186.2s)]

*  I was playing Ed McMahon for Sacs [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2190.64s)]
*  when he hit the roast last night. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2192.44s)]

*  Every time he hit it, I just would bang the table. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2195.72s)]
*  You didn't get Hellmuth off the cliff. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2198.16s)]
*  I was waiting for that moment. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2199.8399999999997s)]
*  Poor Hellmuth. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2200.68s)]
*  All the way off the cliff. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2201.52s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2202.64s)]
*  I think he knows how. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2203.48s)]
*  You know what happened? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2204.7999999999997s)]
*  Cat told me what happened. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2205.64s)]
*  So the backstory is Phil Hellmuth is a narcissist. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2206.8799999999997s)]
*  And. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2210.12s)]
*  No, no. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2210.96s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2212.64s)]
*  That's implied. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2213.48s)]
*  And he just cannot give a speech. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2214.3199999999997s)]
*  He's your best friend. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2215.16s)]

*  But he gives horrible speeches. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2221.0s)]
*  You and he are best friends. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2223.44s)]
*  Every speech. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2224.84s)]
*  No, Phil. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2226.6800000000003s)]

*  That's why we say seven seconds to Phil. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2231.04s)]
*  But it's incredible because it could be. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2232.7200000000003s)]
*  It goes off the rules. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2234.04s)]
*  It could be a wedding, a bar mitzvah, a funeral. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2234.88s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2236.7200000000003s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2237.56s)]
*  But in our chat, so when Chamath said, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2238.4s)]
*  okay, Phil's going to give a speech, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2240.2400000000002s)]
*  Phil's like, of course I'm going to give a speech. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2242.0s)]
*  Every speech I give is amazing. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2244.0s)]
*  I kill it every time. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2247.12s)]
*  I raise $70 million. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2247.96s)]
*  Then he goes, the last event, I gave a speech. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2248.8s)]
*  It brought the house down. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2253.0s)]
*  Everyone was laughing. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2254.16s)]
*  I killed it. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2256.28s)]
*  It was Doyle Brunson's funeral. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2257.48s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2259.2400000000002s)]
*  No, dude. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2260.2400000000002s)]
*  What? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2261.32s)]
*  You killed it at a funeral? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2262.48s)]
*  So I asked Helmuth to do this toast. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2264.84s)]
*  And I was like, okay, well, we'll do four of them. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2267.52s)]
*  But I thought if we start with Helmuth, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2269.64s)]
*  it'll just be so bad. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2271.04s)]

*  I think it's fascinating. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2485.66s)]
*  I tweeted about this a couple of weeks ago. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2486.5s)]
*  My observations on this were twofold. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2487.3399999999997s)]
*  One is that it's going to have the exact opposite effect [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2489.3399999999997s)]
*  that they want. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2492.02s)]
*  If what they want, if what the writers [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2493.0s)]
*  and the actors guild want is to show the owners [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2494.8199999999997s)]
*  of the studios, how valuable they are. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2499.2999999999997s)]
*  The problem is that this moves the owners [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2502.2999999999997s)]
*  and the studios one step closer into the hands of tools [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2505.58s)]
*  that will disintermediate the actors and the writers. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2509.38s)]
*  They'll embrace that technology. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2512.2599999999998s)]
*  They'll embrace the AI tools that you guys have talked about. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2513.98s)]
*  You are showing something around even like yesterday [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2516.42s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2519.38s)]
*  So like the point is like, I don't see it as very effective. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2520.2s)]
*  And then my second thought is like, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2523.14s)]
*  I just think unions in general are probably not a very [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2524.54s)]
*  effective way to get these concessions anymore [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2528.18s)]
*  versus the tax that the union members pay. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2532.14s)]
*  And you can just see that in terms of like the number [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2536.42s)]
*  of people in unions are just kind of decaying [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2538.06s)]
*  pretty quickly. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2540.54s)]
*  The wage gains are pretty de minimis. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2541.38s)]
*  It's just not an effective mechanism of negotiation. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2543.18s)]
*  Sacks, the unions are a way for average performers [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2545.82s)]
*  to fight to get a little bit more. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2550.1s)]
*  But it's the antithesis of having a meritocracy [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2552.06s)]
*  and people fighting for their best possible pay. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2556.34s)]
*  And so the conundrum I have is I'm seeing all these [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2559.5s)]
*  Marvel actors, superhero actors getting dropped off [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2562.5s)]
*  at the protests. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2565.78s)]
*  And they're complaining about Bob Iger making 25 million [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2567.1s)]
*  when Tom Cruise or Robert Downey Jr. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2570.22s)]
*  Pick the person, I'm not singling anybody out. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2573.74s)]
*  But those people who got to the top of the heap [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2575.94s)]
*  after 20, 30, 40 years in the business [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2577.94s)]
*  are getting paid 50 million a picture. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2580.42s)]
*  100 million a picture of back ends. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2582.58s)]
*  And so what's your take on what's going on here? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2584.58s)]
*  Because it seems, I don't want to say hypocritical, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2587.88s)]
*  but it feels like they're talking [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2591.48s)]
*  out of both sides of their mouth. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2593.4s)]
*  They want to have an auction to the highest bidder [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2594.36s)]
*  for these incredibly talented writers, directors, producers [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2598.72s)]
*  as it should be. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2601.52s)]
*  But then they also want to fight for the average. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2602.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2605.12s)]
*  It's confusing to me. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2605.72s)]
*  Some of the union demands I think are reasonable [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2606.44s)]
*  and I understand why they want them. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2608.6s)]
*  So for example, I think they're arguing for more residuals [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2609.96s)]
*  for, like you said, the kind of lower level performers [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2613.8s)]
*  so that they can get health care. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2617.0s)]
*  The average ones. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2618.44s)]
*  Yeah, so I can understand that. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2619.16s)]
*  At the same time, they're demanding that writers rooms [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2621.24s)]
*  not use AI software. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2624.12s)]
*  Which they're already doing. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2625.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, which is just crazy because AI is going [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2626.9199999999996s)]
*  to be incorporated into all software. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2629.52s)]
*  So to not be able to use the latest features of whatever, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2631.04s)]
*  Word or Google Docs or whatever screenwriting software. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2635.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2638.08s)]
*  That's like the king who ordered the tides to stop. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2638.4799999999996s)]
*  You know, this is just a march of technology. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2640.52s)]
*  It's not going to work. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2642.4399999999996s)]
*  So I think that's like really off base. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2643.3999999999996s)]
*  So I can sympathize with some of the demands. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2645.3599999999997s)]
*  Other ones I think are hard to see. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2647.08s)]
*  In terms of your point about the economics, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2648.72s)]
*  the basic problem with Hollywood is it's a winner [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2651.7599999999998s)]
*  take all business. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2654.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, you've got a few actors who become big stars. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2655.24s)]
*  This is true actually with all the creative industries. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2658.2799999999997s)]
*  Is there power law businesses? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2661.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, J.K. Rowling makes a billion dollars as an author. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2663.2799999999997s)]
*  The 10,000 author or whatever makes almost nothing. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2667.88s)]
*  Yeah, the thousand fantasy person makes a living. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2671.52s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2673.64s)]
*  They're living months of money. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2674.48s)]
*  Yeah, can't even make a living. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2675.56s)]
*  And the reason for that, by the way, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2676.48s)]
*  is because there's a lot of people [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2678.12s)]
*  willing to do it for free. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2679.56s)]
*  Humans are fundamentally creative. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2680.76s)]
*  There's a lot of people willing to be actors for free [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2682.2400000000002s)]
*  or on a specific situation or write [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2685.36s)]
*  or whatever creatively because they're willing [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2687.6800000000003s)]
*  to do their art for free. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2689.8s)]
*  Podcasts. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2691.2400000000002s)]
*  Right, and so the reality is the reason Hollywood [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2692.0800000000004s)]
*  doesn't have to pay these sort of the entry level actors [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2694.6400000000003s)]
*  very much is there's a lot of people willing to do that job. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2698.36s)]
*  There's too many people on that job. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2700.88s)]
*  A lot of people willing to do that job. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2701.7200000000003s)]
*  And it doesn't need to be in a structured production system [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2702.5600000000004s)]
*  anymore. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2705.28s)]
*  You guys saw the latest Disney earnings release [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2706.44s)]
*  when Iger said, we are going to consider selling that geo [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2709.12s)]
*  and a bunch of other channels. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2713.3199999999997s)]
*  There may actually be a spinoff because content creation [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2714.72s)]
*  for that mid tier or that tail no longer makes sense. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2718.36s)]
*  Not viable. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2721.72s)]
*  Profitable because there's so much content being generated [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2722.56s)]
*  by this very long tail that's accruing a lot of the eyeballs [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2725.04s)]
*  and a lot of the hours of consumers mindset and time. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2728.2799999999997s)]
*  I think that there's a big disrupt. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2730.68s)]
*  Just to connect that idea. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2732.7599999999998s)]
*  So we were talking earlier about career choices. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2734.08s)]
*  So first of all, I agree with what you guys said [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2736.48s)]
*  about the time you have to make, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2739.3599999999997s)]
*  but it's not really about time per se. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2740.2s)]
*  It's about your obsession level. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2742.3999999999996s)]
*  Can you be obsessed with something so that 60, 70 hours [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2744.64s)]
*  a week feels like nothing to you because you're so immersed. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2748.12s)]
*  You're so obsessed with it. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2750.9199999999996s)]
*  The way that Tarantino and Avery are obsessed [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2752.08s)]
*  with classic films have the whole database in their head. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2753.7999999999997s)]
*  So if you want to pursue one of these careers [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2756.52s)]
*  in a winner take all space, like writing, like acting [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2758.9599999999996s)]
*  or whatever, you better just be completely obsessed. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2762.52s)]
*  You gotta be all in. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2764.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta be all in. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2765.72s)]
*  I'd say furthermore. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2766.88s)]
*  And be unique, like what makes you novel. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2768.1200000000003s)]
*  Even if you are all in, you still have to have luck [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2770.88s)]
*  and skill and. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2774.04s)]
*  Yeah, and furthermore, you have to know where the bar is. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2774.88s)]
*  So I think a lot of people, this is one of the things [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2776.92s)]
*  I noticed when I was producing a movie is a lot of people [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2778.8s)]
*  look at like the worst actor or the worst screenwriter [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2781.88s)]
*  and say, I'm better than that person. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2785.7200000000003s)]
*  So I'm gonna make it. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2787.28s)]
*  But your bar is not the worst person who's made it. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2788.8s)]
*  Your bar is the best person who hasn't made it. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2792.6000000000004s)]
*  That's the person you're really competing against. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2795.2000000000003s)]
*  It's the next up. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2797.12s)]
*  It's the person you're going on auditions [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2797.88s)]
*  and you're competing against someone who hasn't made it yet, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2800.12s)]
*  but they're amazing. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2802.0s)]
*  And you don't necessarily know where that bar is [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2803.12s)]
*  because it's much harder to see. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2805.0s)]
*  But that's where the bar really is. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2806.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2808.12s)]
*  Look, I think there's also a big disruption. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2808.84s)]
*  It's really well said. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2811.0s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2811.68s)]
*  And as we extend the long tail of consumer content creation [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2812.84s)]
*  into what is effectively now the infinite tail of AI generation, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2816.84s)]
*  AI generated content creation, it is gonna totally disrupt [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2821.08s)]
*  and change the game of media, of content, generally speaking. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2824.48s)]
*  We're getting to a point now where you can effectively [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2828.72s)]
*  tie together rendering engines with scripting, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2831.08s)]
*  with scene definition, with directorial lines, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2834.6s)]
*  all the stuff that goes into pre-production and production [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2837.72s)]
*  can be generated through AI, through scripting, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2841.36s)]
*  and then tuned and tweaked by a human. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2844.68s)]
*  But ultimately, it increases the scale. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2847.2s)]
*  Like all technologies do, it increases leverage for humans. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2849.2s)]
*  And we could see 100 times more films come out, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2852.08s)]
*  each of which costs one 100th the cost. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2854.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, one of the best production companies in LA is Blumhouse. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2857.0s)]
*  You know, they make films. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2859.6s)]
*  They make get out. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2860.52s)]
*  $2 million, $300 million. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2861.08s)]
*  They make them for $2 million. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2861.96s)]
*  And they make a bunch of them because they cost so little to make. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2863.36s)]
*  And if any one of them hits, they make $180 million [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2866.04s)]
*  or $200 million at the box office. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2868.0s)]
*  It's a fantastic business model. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2869.36s)]
*  Genre films. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2870.44s)]
*  It's very much a unique model in Hollywood. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2871.2400000000002s)]
*  And it's really changed the game quite a bit. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2873.56s)]
*  And I think we're gonna see something similar emerge [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2875.44s)]
*  because of generative AI and the tooling. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2877.32s)]
*  And then people start to question... [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2879.2400000000002s)]
*  What is it called? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2880.36s)]
*  Oh. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2882.7200000000003s)]
*  But look, one thing I do want to say, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2884.32s)]
*  I do think that there's also a change in Hollywood [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2887.48s)]
*  that's going to be driven, as we talked about before, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2889.6400000000003s)]
*  by the ability to generate personalized film, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2891.7200000000003s)]
*  personalized content, rather than one piece of content for everyone [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2894.1200000000003s)]
*  where you have to make blockbusters and everyone watches it. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2897.96s)]
*  There is a question, however, of culture. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2900.5200000000004s)]
*  And culture is, you know, shared experience, stories and beliefs. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2903.2400000000002s)]
*  Shared experience, stories and beliefs can still be realized [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2907.6000000000004s)]
*  through personalized media, through personalized content generation. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2910.72s)]
*  Think about, you know, an old narrative, an old tale that was told, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2915.08s)]
*  you know, via people speaking to each other around a campfire. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2918.3199999999997s)]
*  The ethics and the morals of the story are still there, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2921.3599999999997s)]
*  but everyone tells it a little bit differently. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2923.7599999999998s)]
*  I think that's what we may end up seeing Hollywood production [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2925.6s)]
*  or AI-generated production rendering, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2927.7999999999997s)]
*  which is everyone tweaks their content in their own personal way. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2930.2s)]
*  They consume it in their own way. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2932.7599999999998s)]
*  But the Hollywood studios, how much of a role [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2934.08s)]
*  do they ultimately end up playing? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2935.7999999999997s)]
*  And does this start to go 10 times more [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2937.2799999999997s)]
*  than what we've seen in YouTube? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2939.92s)]
*  Content consumption goes way up. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2941.28s)]
*  And the number of folks that are contributing to it goes way up by 10 or 100x. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2943.64s)]
*  I think this is one of the fundamental things that the unions and Hollywood [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2947.2400000000002s)]
*  have not yet grok'd completely, which is they're not fighting each other. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2951.64s)]
*  They're fighting TikTok, YouTube, podcasts and people making their own content. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2955.84s)]
*  That's taking... They know it. They know it. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2960.04s)]
*  They're fighting Jimmy Donaldson. They're fighting Mr. Beast. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2962.12s)]
*  They're fighting Mr. Beast. They're fighting each other [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2964.04s)]
*  over the last scraps of a dark model. Yes, exactly. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2965.88s)]
*  They're fighting KSI. They're fighting the people [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2968.92s)]
*  that spend two hours a week listening to us rant on about stuff, right? [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2971.1600000000003s)]
*  They're fighting the Botez sisters. That's what I'm saying. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2974.1600000000003s)]
*  It's two less hours of broadcast TV. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2976.6800000000003s)]
*  And then in Mr. Beast, these kids watch his videos five times. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2978.92s)]
*  They watch each one five times. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2982.36s)]
*  He's probably the only person in recent memory that has rebuilt [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2983.84s)]
*  event-based viewership, because people know Saturday mornings at noon [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2988.7200000000003s)]
*  Eastern time is when these videos drop. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2992.96s)]
*  Hundreds of millions of people... It's appointment television. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2995.56s)]
*  It's appointment television. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2997.72s)]
*  Now, by the way, when you hear the story about Mr. Beast, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=2999.24s)]
*  that's a guy that's been doing it since he was 13 years old. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3002.9199999999996s)]
*  Studying it. He's 24 years old. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3005.7999999999997s)]
*  So that's 11 years where he's literally only lived and breathed. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3007.3599999999997s)]
*  High energy iteration. And in the laboratory. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3011.12s)]
*  High energy iteration in the lab, down to the very pixel, right? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3012.8399999999997s)]
*  Like when he, for example... And the cuts. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3016.3599999999997s)]
*  Remember, you watch his cuts on his videos? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3018.56s)]
*  Remember he told us about like thumbnails? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3020.12s)]
*  He has an entire PhD thesis that he's learned just on thumbnails. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3021.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. And that's a level of commitment. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3025.48s)]
*  I think what Hollywood needs to do, just to put it out there, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3026.92s)]
*  is the leadership in Hollywood gets compensated on a corporate level. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3030.12s)]
*  And then they come up with this, you know, pay and sometimes residual, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3035.56s)]
*  sometimes not, and scraps for the talent. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3039.4s)]
*  I would encourage them to read something like an autobiography by Kurosawa [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3042.48s)]
*  and study the Toho system where everybody was aligned inside the company. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3047.32s)]
*  If I'm running Disney, I'm hiring the top 200 or 300 writers, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3051.6800000000003s)]
*  putting them full time on staff, giving them equity and getting everybody [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3054.52s)]
*  rowing in the right direction. They do not have time to fuck around. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3057.92s)]
*  They need to be in alignment, making great content. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3060.84s)]
*  But the incentive structure matters. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3063.88s)]
*  If Bob Iger is getting compensated by stock options, the actors, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3065.64s)]
*  Robert Downey Jr., who's the guy, the incredible director of Swingers and... [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3070.92s)]
*  Ron Favreau. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3075.44s)]
*  Favreau. I was talking to Favreau at an event and I was like, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3076.56s)]
*  how much like equity in Disney did you get for doing Mandalorian and like [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3079.8s)]
*  launching Disney Plus for them? And he's like, zero. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3084.6800000000003s)]
*  Zero. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3086.7200000000003s)]
*  And I'm like, why do they not back up a hundred million dollars in equity? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3087.44s)]
*  And this is what's crazy. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3092.0400000000004s)]
*  If you look at the biggest content producers of that older generation, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3092.84s)]
*  they locked up the equity. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3096.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, Spielberg owns equity in the movies that he made. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3097.5600000000004s)]
*  George Lucas owns equity in the movies. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3100.0800000000004s)]
*  He owned part of the studios. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3101.6400000000003s)]
*  Did you see the deal Christopher Nolan cut on Oppenheimer? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3103.0s)]
*  No. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3106.32s)]
*  I think he gets 20 percent of the gross off the first dollar. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3106.8s)]
*  That's absurd. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3109.92s)]
*  Yeah. And he got a hundred million dollar budget and a hundred million [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3110.5600000000004s)]
*  marketing commit on the on the deal. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3112.7200000000003s)]
*  Joker was Todd Phillips. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3116.76s)]
*  Well, this is a perfect example. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3119.48s)]
*  I was talking to Todd Phillips, actually. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3120.2400000000002s)]
*  I got to have dinner with him last summer. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3122.2000000000003s)]
*  Great guy. Yeah. Yeah. Great guy. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3123.2400000000002s)]
*  And he waived his fee on Joker to take a big chunk of the equity. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3125.04s)]
*  Because Todd Phillips is very smart. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3130.28s)]
*  He did that on The Hangover and he owned the IP of The Hangover. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3131.4s)]
*  He owned the sequels and Hangover one and two. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3134.64s)]
*  Amazing Hangover three. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3138.4s)]
*  You can miss it. Yeah. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3140.24s)]
*  But he made more, I think, on Hangover three. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3141.92s)]
*  And he got all those guys, Galifianakis, etc. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3144.4s)]
*  They got their biggest payday on number three. Right. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3147.08s)]
*  And you have to craft a deal. We have equity. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3149.3599999999997s)]
*  The other crazy. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3151.2s)]
*  The studio was less bullish than he was on both Hangover and Joker, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3152.64s)]
*  because they're both shows you how unusual movies. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3156.04s)]
*  So they allowed him to take equity in exchange for giving back. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3158.56s)]
*  They're like, you only want to spend 50 million on a superhero film. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3162.2s)]
*  That's never going to work. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3165.16s)]
*  And then he's like, yeah, it made a billion. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3166.12s)]
*  Joker made a billion. Right. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3168.08s)]
*  They thought it was too dark. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3169.7599999999998s)]
*  Underestimating audiences, as always. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3171.24s)]
*  And I'll tell you a very funny poker story. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3173.52s)]
*  Todd Phillips, you want to hear? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3175.24s)]
*  Your Disney stock right now? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3176.04s)]
*  I'm going to ride it out. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3178.16s)]
*  I think their IP collection is amazing. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3179.04s)]
*  I think there's a chance that, you know, depending on how the FTC winds up [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3181.2s)]
*  being run over the long term, that Disney could be selling pieces of that business. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3186.12s)]
*  And I think that it could become an acquisition target itself at some point. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3191.8s)]
*  You want to hear Todd Phillips, focus? [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3195.32s)]
*  I play a part with him. Yeah, he's he's. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3196.92s)]
*  Todd Phillips is a very, very disciplined poker player. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3198.44s)]
*  You know, he's got like a stop loss. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3202.56s)]
*  He hits the stop loss. He's done. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3204.72s)]
*  And he's very funny and jokes around, you know, bus balls, whatever. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3206.52s)]
*  And there was a while where he would play in the big game in L.A. with us. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3211.36s)]
*  And he didn't say much. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3215.7599999999998s)]
*  He was very focused and tight is right. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3216.84s)]
*  And then he did this deal and then Hangover 3 comes out. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3218.92s)]
*  And all of a sudden, you know, he's got chirping chips. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3221.92s)]
*  He's splashing the pot. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3225.44s)]
*  I bust Phillips in a pot and he looks at me and he called me Slumdog billionaire. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3226.32s)]
*  The guys at the table thought it was so funny because that movie Slumdog [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3234.48s)]
*  Millionaire had just come out. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3237.6400000000003s)]
*  So then they all started calling me slummy slumped. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3239.28s)]
*  That's going to stick. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3243.2400000000002s)]
*  It took me a year for them to get stop calling you that. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3244.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, pretty great. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3246.44s)]
*  On the union thing, I'll tell you a story. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3247.32s)]
*  So recently it was just announced that anchor steam shut down. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3248.6800000000003s)]
*  Anchor steam was this beer, this native beer in San Francisco [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3252.44s)]
*  that's been around forever. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3255.6000000000004s)]
*  Japanese brewery bought them, right? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3256.8s)]
*  It was bought by Sapporo several years ago. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3258.2000000000003s)]
*  Anchor steam shut down. Anchor steam shut down. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3260.76s)]
*  Yeah, I used to go there all the time. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3262.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, like work events. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3264.1600000000003s)]
*  You do like an offsite there and go to the brewery. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3265.04s)]
*  It's yeah, it was like one of the original. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3267.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Fantastic. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3269.0800000000004s)]
*  Iconic winning beer. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3270.32s)]
*  Iconic. Well, it's out of business now. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3271.48s)]
*  And the reason is, well, it was losing money. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3273.76s)]
*  And you want to know why is because three years ago, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3276.72s)]
*  the workers all voted to unionize. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3279.24s)]
*  There were only something like 60 workers, 62 workers. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3281.4399999999996s)]
*  And three years ago, they vote to unionize and they voted themselves big pay increases. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3284.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And so I guess support had to go along with it. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3288.52s)]
*  Three years later, it's like, yeah, shut the whole thing down. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3290.8399999999997s)]
*  I think that's the thing is you got to be careful what you wish for. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3294.68s)]
*  This is overplay. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3297.2s)]
*  I really think the thing with unions that they get wrong is unions fight for exactly this, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3298.16s)]
*  which is this short term increase in current compensation. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3303.12s)]
*  And I think what unions do very poorly is actually understanding [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3307.7599999999998s)]
*  the long term equity that the employees and members of that union actually create. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3312.2799999999997s)]
*  I tweeted this a few weeks ago as well, but the single biggest reason [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3316.64s)]
*  that motivated me when I sold my piece of the Warriors [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3321.7599999999998s)]
*  was obviously just a crazy increase in the valuation. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3325.96s)]
*  Right. I bought it for, you know, 300, 600. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3328.96s)]
*  And it was worth five point two billion at the time. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3332.64s)]
*  But the second biggest reason was my huge fear [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3334.68s)]
*  was that I as an owner, I just wanted to cash in the chips [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3338.96s)]
*  because I think the most right thing to do for the union, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3342.72s)]
*  like the NBA Players Association, is to fight for equity. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3346.6s)]
*  Yeah. It's like Michael Jordan single handedly has created [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3349.68s)]
*  15 billion dollars of equity in the NBA. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3354.92s)]
*  Yeah. How much has he captured? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3357.64s)]
*  One or two billion, but not from the league. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3359.3599999999997s)]
*  He captured it accidentally from shoes. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3361.56s)]
*  Right. How much money is LeBron James actually created for the NBA? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3364.32s)]
*  It's enormous. Yep. How much is he? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3367.48s)]
*  He made. They're not trying to get the right piece. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3370.32s)]
*  They're not trying to get the right. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3372.96s)]
*  Also, when the business doesn't do well, then the labor contracts [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3374.12s)]
*  become a source of huge inflexibility, huge inflexibility. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3378.36s)]
*  You can't make the necessary business changes. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3380.64s)]
*  It's your point. The business gets shut down. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3382.2799999999997s)]
*  So to your point, like when you when what happens now is there's these huge [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3383.96s)]
*  luxury taxes in professional sports. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3387.64s)]
*  And so folks bloat the payroll. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3390.3999999999996s)]
*  They try to get all these players. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3392.48s)]
*  But if you don't win and get to the playoffs, you're not selling more merch. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3393.68s)]
*  You're not getting incremental share of TV revenues. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3397.24s)]
*  You're not getting ticket revenues. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3400.68s)]
*  And all of a sudden you have these massive luxury taxes [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3402.56s)]
*  you have to pay and not enough revenue to pay for it. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3405.16s)]
*  And so these teams all of a sudden now start to gush money, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3407.3999999999996s)]
*  have to make capital calls because these things that sound incredible up front [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3410.8399999999997s)]
*  start to become real weights on these businesses. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3415.04s)]
*  The real thing all unions in all industries, I would I would tell you all to do is [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3417.96s)]
*  figure out how to get the equity upside in the business in which your members [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3422.08s)]
*  are working in and are creating value. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3427.08s)]
*  Right. And in exchange for that, have more forgiveness on the downside. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3429.52s)]
*  So the business actually persevere whether the storm is supposed to have to shut down. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3432.12s)]
*  Exactly alignment, you know, alignment, alignment, incentives are just so critical. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3436.68s)]
*  I was talking to the head of one of the giant publishers. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3440.28s)]
*  I wouldn't say which one. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3444.32s)]
*  Ibnis Insider, I don't know which one it was, but they were being unionized. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3445.68s)]
*  And I said, wow, is this a disaster for your business? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3451.44s)]
*  He said, Jake, how great thing ever. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3453.7599999999998s)]
*  I said, why? He's like, now when people come to us and they want to get paid more, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3455.8399999999997s)]
*  we just take out the chart. How many years have you been here? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3460.16s)]
*  Oh, five. OK, yeah. One, two, three, four, five. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3462.68s)]
*  Seventy two thousand. And there's a woman. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3465.2799999999997s)]
*  But I bring more pages. I was like, yeah, OK, yeah. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3467.3599999999997s)]
*  Page you multiplier point one five. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3469.44s)]
*  OK, so you're seventy eight. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3471.8799999999997s)]
*  And just basically that's what happens to business insider. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3473.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's kind of who knows why they're a clickbait business. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3476.68s)]
*  And then that drives perverse incentives. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3481.2799999999997s)]
*  And it's like, why not align it with what is the profitability of the business? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3483.2s)]
*  What is the growth of the business? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3487.24s)]
*  A bonus pool, a base level of pay. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3488.6s)]
*  And if the unions are coming in, they are literally rearranging the chairs [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3490.4399999999996s)]
*  on the Titanic. And it's that simple. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3494.64s)]
*  You if you know, the beer industry and Hollywood are both drinking industries. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3497.12s)]
*  And so when you got unions demanding more and more and more of a shrinking pie, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3502.36s)]
*  something's going to break. Now, look, just to be clear, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3505.92s)]
*  I'm in favor of unions demanding things like better working conditions [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3508.04s)]
*  and health care and just like the basics. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3511.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. But, you know, when they try to go for things like, I don't know, banning AI [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3513.7200000000003s)]
*  and weird and proposals that distort the cost structure of the business [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3518.6s)]
*  to the point where it's just not feasible, it's not profitable. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3523.52s)]
*  That doesn't work. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3526.1200000000003s)]
*  Also, the question is, white collar workers who can move so freely between jobs. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3526.76s)]
*  Yeah. So elite. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3532.2000000000003s)]
*  Why would any white collar worker who is learning and sharpening their blade [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3534.2000000000003s)]
*  and increasing their value year after year, why would they even want to join a union? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3538.84s)]
*  There was a podcast union that started in Spotify and Gimlet Media, all of this stuff. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3543.36s)]
*  And one of the podcasts, I think it was Reply All. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3548.8s)]
*  They didn't want to join the union because they're like, well, we're overcompensated. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3551.6800000000003s)]
*  We're a hit show. And then they were all claim that they were [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3554.8s)]
*  looking at what's happening in the schools. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3558.6400000000003s)]
*  So can we steal? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3559.88s)]
*  You can't get rid of a bad teacher because they're in the union. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3561.0s)]
*  So it's like a huge procedure. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3563.88s)]
*  They put them in a building where the incompetent teachers [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3565.08s)]
*  can we have a steel man? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3567.56s)]
*  The pro case of joining a union in twenty twenty three. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3570.04s)]
*  I mean, if you could get how do you feel about it? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3573.2000000000003s)]
*  Benefits like some basic level of benefits. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3575.44s)]
*  Look, I think that the pitch and Jay, this is why I asked you this a few episodes ago. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3580.4s)]
*  You know, tell us your experience having grown up in a family that I think [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3585.08s)]
*  unions are pretty proliferant in these cops, firemen, cops, firemen. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3589.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if you are the pitch is you're part of a membership, you have a voice. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3593.6s)]
*  And that voice always is your advocate. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3598.4s)]
*  And that advocate looks out for benefits, comp, time off, whether or not and how you get fired. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3600.76s)]
*  All the things that you feel you may be unfairly treated by management. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3607.2000000000003s)]
*  There's nothing novel here. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3610.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. It's a strong, appealing point. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3611.36s)]
*  Yeah. So I don't know if that's the best steel man for it because the argument. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3613.56s)]
*  Look, employees, it's a competitive labor market if you have skills that companies want. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3616.6s)]
*  So you should be able to negotiate for a lot of these things yourself. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3620.92s)]
*  I think the steelman case for unions and the reason why they formed in the first place [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3623.44s)]
*  is because American industry was basically owned by an oligopoly. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3627.36s)]
*  They were themselves monopolies. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3631.6s)]
*  So if you have a monopoly of industries like U.S. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3632.92s)]
*  steel or oil, then there's not a competitive labor market. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3636.72s)]
*  They just set the price as they set the conditions. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3641.2s)]
*  That's why the unions got started is you needed a basic monopoly of labor to face off against a monopoly of business. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3643.16s)]
*  That's how it got started. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3651.04s)]
*  And I think in those conditions, we're talking about the early nineteen hundreds. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3652.12s)]
*  People are losing limbs in factories. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3656.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, of course, it was very different working conditions, different working conditions. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3658.24s)]
*  But now you're talking about much more competitive industries. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3661.04s)]
*  But look, you know, like manual labor needed to get productivity out of businesses and enterprise. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3664.24s)]
*  So, you know, so much of industry changed where things became automated, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3669.7599999999998s)]
*  where there became specialization and differentiation amongst the workforce. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3673.7999999999997s)]
*  And it wasn't everyone is just using their arms to do things. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3677.2s)]
*  And, you know, this is obviously now measurable. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3680.56s)]
*  And the idea that you can basically capture management or do a hostile takeover of the corporation or the equity, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3683.12s)]
*  I think is effectively what's happened with a lot of these these. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3689.52s)]
*  And I'll be honest, knowing what I know about unions, if you were to do a deep dive into, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3692.72s)]
*  you know, the police unions or the firefighter unions or the sanitation unions or the teacher unions [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3698.32s)]
*  and you look at their pensions and their overtime, you would see some pretty significant abuse [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3704.36s)]
*  that the unions have built up over years to where people can make three or four hundred [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3711.2400000000002s)]
*  thousand dollars a year in the last two or three years. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3715.36s)]
*  They goose that up because then they base their pension on the average of the last three years. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3717.76s)]
*  And what basically happens is all the senior guys say, listen, all over time goes to these three guys [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3722.32s)]
*  who are retiring in three years and none of the junior guys can take any overtime. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3727.16s)]
*  And when it's your turn, right, you get all that. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3731.12s)]
*  And then we're going to goose your pay. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3734.16s)]
*  So what that does unreasonably is the pension calculation, the pay into the pension is based on some [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3735.68s)]
*  assumption of today. As that starts to happen, the pensions become underfunded because they no longer [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3742.24s)]
*  have enough capital to make all the disbursements that are supposed to happen. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3747.64s)]
*  And there's a big argument now that there's probably over a trillion dollars of underfunded pension [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3750.72s)]
*  liabilities in the United States, many of which are based on the fact that these payout principles [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3755.4s)]
*  were defined by some negotiation with the union. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3760.48s)]
*  And they're games. And there's a large difference between somebody writing a listicle or rewriting a [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3763.0s)]
*  Washington Post story business, a listicle listicle, a listicle. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3768.96s)]
*  Yeah, somebody rewriting a listicle in BuzzFeed or, you know, somebody rewriting a Wall Street Journal [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3773.92s)]
*  paywall story and Business Insider. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3778.6800000000003s)]
*  Then somebody running into a burning building or, you know, having a target on their back as a cop in [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3780.96s)]
*  San Francisco. These are very different jobs. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3787.96s)]
*  And the white collar knowledge workers are lasting what? [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3790.24s)]
*  What's the average tenure right now? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3793.7999999999997s)]
*  Thirty six months, thirty months. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3795.56s)]
*  I mean, you're obviously moving from place to place. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3798.2799999999997s)]
*  What's the point of the union? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3800.92s)]
*  It's a competitive labor market. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3802.2s)]
*  And to your point, it's true that in some cases, the unions do get a better deal for their members. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3803.6s)]
*  However, there is a deadweight loss for the union itself because the unions representing its own [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3809.36s)]
*  interests. One and a half percent. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3814.36s)]
*  So they're taking something. They got a skim. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3816.48s)]
*  They're skimming. They got to pay the VIG. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3818.2000000000003s)]
*  If you watched that Scorsese movie. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3820.1200000000003s)]
*  Was it the Irishman? Irishman. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3821.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. You really get a taste of the corruption that was involved. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3822.92s)]
*  There was some skimming going on. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3825.2000000000003s)]
*  Everybody gets a little skim all of a sudden one and a half times. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3826.4s)]
*  And then also the pension fund starts getting rolled into mob projects or whatever. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3828.88s)]
*  I mean, that's like a while ago. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3833.76s)]
*  But yeah, I there were some significant downsides. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3835.44s)]
*  My view of it is we lived in a decade of surplus elites, you know, having these luxury jobs. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3838.8799999999997s)]
*  And I'll put in the luxury jobs being a journalist, being a venture capitalist, you know, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3847.16s)]
*  these elitist luxury jobs. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3851.16s)]
*  And in some of them, they became so wildly overcompensated. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3852.72s)]
*  I think they wanted to feel oppressed. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3856.44s)]
*  They wanted to feel like they need a representation. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3859.2s)]
*  And I think they were larping, to use the term again, live action, role playing, that they [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3861.24s)]
*  were going to be in a union like they wanted. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3865.7999999999997s)]
*  They're larping as being victims. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3867.52s)]
*  Right. They wanted to like literally the business insider people were putting up pictures [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3869.12s)]
*  of Henry Blodgett and his larping grievances. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3874.32s)]
*  Yes. And they're on the street holding a picket sign up. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3877.08s)]
*  And I'm like, what's the matter? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3879.72s)]
*  Is your keyboard not ergonomic enough at home? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3881.12s)]
*  You haven't been to an office in three fucking years. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3884.28s)]
*  They didn't get the latest flavor of kind bars or whatever. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3886.32s)]
*  Yeah, no, they didn't get the cherry, the cranberry, the kind bar. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3889.04s)]
*  Walnut. Q you. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3892.24s)]
*  Q you. Kind bars. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3893.92s)]
*  I mean, like leave the unions for the people who are actually on the front lines. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3895.3599999999997s)]
*  It's a lose. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3899.3199999999997s)]
*  All right. So I think we could wrap. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3900.44s)]
*  Good. Should we wrap? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3902.52s)]
*  It's probably wrap time. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3903.68s)]
*  Would you want to do a quick science corner update? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3904.64s)]
*  I got a lot of room temps superconductor. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3906.64s)]
*  Yeah, there is a actually it's a very interesting. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3909.3199999999997s)]
*  You may remember a few episodes ago. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3913.08s)]
*  And if you if you don't remember, you kind of can go back and watch it where I talked [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3915.08s)]
*  a little bit about the effort to try and identify a material that can be superconducting [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3919.12s)]
*  at room temperature, which means no resistance. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3923.72s)]
*  Electrons can flow through the material with no resistance. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3925.9199999999996s)]
*  Perfect electricity transfer across distance and also enables the Meissner effect [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3929.08s)]
*  where magnetic waves can reflect off of the material, which can allow things like [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3933.8799999999997s)]
*  levitating trains, which is very low friction transportation. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3937.2s)]
*  All these benefits of superconducting materials are quantum computing, etc. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3940.6s)]
*  So yesterday, and I've gotten literally dozens of emails and notes about this in the [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3944.7599999999998s)]
*  last 12 hours, there was a paper published by a team in South Korea. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3948.9599999999996s)]
*  Who seemed like a very legit team. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3954.3999999999996s)]
*  There's no reason why they would kind of make a fraudulent claim that there is a [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3956.4399999999996s)]
*  material that they've identified and measured to show has superconducting properties [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3960.7599999999998s)]
*  at room temperature and ambient pressure, where a lot of these efforts historically [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3965.72s)]
*  have been made at room temperature, but they use 200 times atmospheric pressure to [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3969.72s)]
*  compress it. And it turns out that this material that they're using is a lead [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3973.4399999999996s)]
*  apatite, which is a hexagonal crystal that uses calcium phosphate and lead and that [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3978.64s)]
*  some of the lead gets replaced with copper and the copper causes the hexagon, the [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3985.3599999999997s)]
*  crystal structure, to compress a little bit. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3990.8399999999997s)]
*  That compressed crystal allows the electrons to flow through. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3992.8799999999997s)]
*  This is their theoretical explanation on what's going on. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3995.7999999999997s)]
*  It will be replicated. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3998.52s)]
*  People will try and do what they are now claiming they did to demonstrate this. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=3999.48s)]
*  There was some condensed matter physics people that sent me an email and said they [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4003.64s)]
*  don't think that this is real. They have a great deal of skepticism. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4007.48s)]
*  But sorry, let me just say two things about this. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4010.6s)]
*  You can read the paper. You can read the paper. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4013.2s)]
*  It's on the Internet. The cameraman is actually put his glasses on. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4015.28s)]
*  He's sleeping behind here. He's just or sleep. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4018.16s)]
*  Let me let me say two things. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4020.0s)]
*  Firstly, I think it's unlikely that these guys are going to make a fraudulent claim. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4021.44s)]
*  Oh, if they did make a fraudulent claim, it would be the end of their careers. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4025.68s)]
*  Their reputation would be damaged. So that may happen if they did not make a fraudulent [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4031.08s)]
*  claim. If they did not make a fraudulent claim and it is and it does turn out to be real, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4034.8s)]
*  then I do think it will end up being the [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4040.32s)]
*  the most important discovery in physics of this century. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4045.1600000000003s)]
*  OK, so either a complete utter fraud or it changes the universe. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4049.1200000000003s)]
*  Look, I know you guys are joking about it, but we talked about the importance of this [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4054.5600000000004s)]
*  material in technology and in everyday life. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4058.76s)]
*  I want to build on top of what you're saying. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4062.0400000000004s)]
*  The thing that you're saying, the more generalized concept is we have such a poor [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4063.4s)]
*  understanding of the periodic table, just broadly speaking of condensed matter, of [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4067.28s)]
*  physics. There's so much about physics and quantum mechanics and just that are still [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4072.12s)]
*  we are just literally poking around, poking around, trying to figure out what's going [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4075.56s)]
*  on. And that's what led to this discovery. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4079.4s)]
*  Suppose the discovery. I've made this analogy before. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4081.04s)]
*  But if you take the periodic table and it actually kind of looks like the United [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4083.12s)]
*  States of America, we have like a really good sense of like the upper northwest and [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4086.44s)]
*  like the East Coast. And otherwise, we don't know anything. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4091.16s)]
*  And I think it was about two and a half years ago, right, the beginning of the [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4094.04s)]
*  pandemic. There were these three guys and I that started with this idea of just [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4097.4s)]
*  building some machine learning to experiment in silica around different [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4101.12s)]
*  materials. Right. And can you guess physical properties? [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4106.24s)]
*  And if you think these properties are better at a certain thing, can we then go [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4110.2s)]
*  and actually make samples and figure it out? [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4113.28s)]
*  And we pointed it at batteries and we said, let's just take the cheapest form of [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4114.76s)]
*  batteries, LFP lithium, right. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4120.52s)]
*  That's used in the Model 3 and let's make better LFP. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4122.400000000001s)]
*  And what we're finding is, holy shit, like we don't know anything. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4125.360000000001s)]
*  And there are these like really big breakthroughs, one which we'll probably [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4129.4800000000005s)]
*  announce in like the next few weeks because we just raised a bunch of money [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4132.4800000000005s)]
*  around this idea. But it's all just people experimenting better and smarter. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4134.84s)]
*  And really what you find is that there just aren't enough of those people doing [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4139.96s)]
*  it. And so the cycle time is just too long. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4143.64s)]
*  Well, and this is where I can actually have some incredible gain [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4145.92s)]
*  transformational as I get smarter. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4149.56s)]
*  Transformation put in the inputs, you give it the data set. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4152.4400000000005s)]
*  We don't know what it's going to come up with. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4155.76s)]
*  And it could profoundly the better version of part of what increase our [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4157.0s)]
*  understanding of part of what this Korean team did is they had a separate paper [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4161.160000000001s)]
*  that they published talking about the demonstration of using A.I. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4164.8s)]
*  to try and be predictive around quantum mechanics, which is something that people [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4168.52s)]
*  said we can't really do quantum modeling until we get quantum computers. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4171.96s)]
*  And so there has been this belief that once we get quantum computers, we'll be [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4175.5599999999995s)]
*  able to understand the physics of the quantum scale and be able to do modeling [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4179.96s)]
*  that will allow us to do more discovery. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4184.639999999999s)]
*  But we are still very much just poking around and theorizing. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4186.28s)]
*  And every cycle, by the way, in superconductor research, there's a different [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4189.799999999999s)]
*  theory on what causes superconductivity. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4193.08s)]
*  And it shows how little we do actually. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4195.4s)]
*  So these guys, basically, when we were trying to build. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4198.24s)]
*  So if you if you look at like a Tesla Model S or Model X, these are NMC or [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4200.759999999999s)]
*  NCA batteries, right? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4205.24s)]
*  Very, very, very energy rich, but also very expensive and very complicated [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4206.2s)]
*  batteries that won't scale to the average everyday car. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4210.599999999999s)]
*  And what was crazy in our attempt to take L.F.P., which is the cheap version, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4214.48s)]
*  and make it as keep the cheapness, but as energy dense as NMC and NCA, [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4218.8s)]
*  we ended up doping it with all kinds of random stuff that you would have never [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4224.639999999999s)]
*  guessed in a million years, given billions of dollars you would. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4228.679999999999s)]
*  You needed computers to go off and actually make these guesses. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4232.88s)]
*  So this idea that we're going to find all this stuff at the periodic table [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4236.08s)]
*  bumbling around, I think, is such an interesting part of the physical sciences. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4239.4400000000005s)]
*  And again, this will lead to infinite energy storage in batteries. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4244.08s)]
*  Yeah. You can put electricity into a battery if you had a superconducting battery [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4247.64s)]
*  and it would cycle forever. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4251.68s)]
*  No resistance. And then you could just plug in and get the energy back out. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4252.84s)]
*  So imagine infinite storage on batteries. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4255.400000000001s)]
*  You have to reinvent circuitry completely. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4257.4400000000005s)]
*  So you can there are already superconducting circuits that are used in quantum [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4260.24s)]
*  computers and other high end applications. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4264.679999999999s)]
*  But because they're so expensive to cool and so expensive to operate, they're not [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4266.639999999999s)]
*  ubiquitous. But the power of having them be ubiquitous would be extraordinary [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4270.8s)]
*  computing for discovery, for AI, for modeling the applications of what we'll end [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4274.639999999999s)]
*  up discovering because of the modeling we can now do in a more ubiquitous way is [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4278.76s)]
*  going to be incredible. These are very profound moments when they do. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4281.72s)]
*  And if they do happen, we should be excited, optimistic, but obviously very, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4284.92s)]
*  very cautious about where and when they have it. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4289.84s)]
*  Yeah, I really love you. What an incredible. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4293.12s)]
*  I'm so thankful that you guys came and showed up. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4295.4400000000005s)]
*  It really means a lot to me. Thank you. Fantastic. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4298.12s)]
*  Yeah, incredible. I really love you guys. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4300.04s)]
*  Thank you very, very much for that. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4302.280000000001s)]
*  All right, we'll see everybody at the all in summit. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4303.52s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. Yum. Yum. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4306.6s)]
*  It's in like in this is like six weeks more. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4308.400000000001s)]
*  A little more. You have a new party plan. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4311.16s)]
*  I got you have a new person. You have a new person to announce. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4312.64s)]
*  I will announce it and then we'll take it out if it's not OK. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4315.16s)]
*  But we did confirm Ray Dalio. So we'll add him to the speaker list. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4317.56s)]
*  We've got a few other guests that we're not going to announce. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4320.56s)]
*  That will be last minute fun surprises for everyone. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4322.68s)]
*  Always some fun surprises at the end. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4324.84s)]
*  Really excited to have Ray Dalio. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4326.68s)]
*  Closing in on the story. Yeah. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4327.76s)]
*  How the party's going for the summer. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4329.120000000001s)]
*  The parties we we have narrowed down to three themes. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4330.280000000001s)]
*  We think are going to be a lot of fun. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4333.240000000001s)]
*  Opening night, Sunday night, the day before the event starts, September 10th. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4334.72s)]
*  I think that is you have locations yet. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4338.320000000001s)]
*  We are negotiating the final contracts for the locations. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4340.240000000001s)]
*  We've got about a dozen of them and we're going to narrow it down to the three [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4342.92s)]
*  that give us the best flexibility. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4345.6s)]
*  We'll have the floor plans, which is the last step. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4347.52s)]
*  You know, you got like six weeks, right? [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4351.88s)]
*  Yeah, no, no. It's we have more than enough options now. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4353.160000000001s)]
*  So Sunday night, we'll be J Cal's handling the parties, not me. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4355.200000000001s)]
*  I'm doing the parties. You want to hear a great all in summit story? [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4358.52s)]
*  Yeah, but let me just go through the three. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4361.400000000001s)]
*  The three party themes. So opening night is going to be bestie Royale. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4363.200000000001s)]
*  The bestie who loved me, a James Bond theme. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4367.160000000001s)]
*  So what is that? Tuxedos, white tuxedos, white tuxedos. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4368.8s)]
*  Or you could go as a Bond girl or you could go as Austin Powers. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4371.52s)]
*  Anything in that theme casino games. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4374.64s)]
*  But no black tuxedo. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4376.6s)]
*  You can go black tuxedo, go white tuxedo. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4377.88s)]
*  You could go Daniel Craig. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4379.360000000001s)]
*  You could go Sean Connery, Roger Moore, you pick you. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4380.4800000000005s)]
*  You go. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4382.8s)]
*  You go whatever you like. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4384.08s)]
*  The black tux. I've tried the white tux. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4385.200000000001s)]
*  It doesn't. Yeah, you go. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4386.76s)]
*  For me, I look like a waiter. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4388.96s)]
*  And so it'd be like I like the Yacht Club of San Francisco. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4390.72s)]
*  And then Monday night, we have a good word. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4393.96s)]
*  So it's bucket hat. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpDzcCHERX4&t=4396.04s)]
