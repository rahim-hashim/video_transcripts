# What Are Monoclonal Antibodies and How Can They Fight Covid-19?  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ)
*  Demand for life-saving COVID-19 antibody drugs is on the rise. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Just four months ago, drugmaker Regeneron reported an average of less than 5,000 dose deliveries per week. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=5.0s)]
*  By September, the number increased to over 150,000 doses. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=12.0s)]
*  This is happening as hospitalizations remain high. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=17.0s)]
*  In late August, over 100,000 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized nationwide, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=20.0s)]
*  a daily average not seen since last winter's surge. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=25.0s)]
*  This comes as the Delta variant sweeps through the country and health care systems become overwhelmed. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=29.0s)]
*  For those who are vaccinated, severe illness and hospitalization due to the coronavirus still remains rare, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=35.0s)]
*  but millions of adults remain unvaccinated. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=42.0s)]
*  And for high-risk patients who do get sick, doctors are increasingly turning to antibody drugs to treat them. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=45.0s)]
*  To understand why they've become so critical in the fight against COVID-19, you need to understand how they work. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=51.0s)]
*  When patients are infected by the new coronavirus, their immune systems should produce antibodies. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=59.0s)]
*  These immune proteins bind to the virus and prevent it from spreading throughout the body. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=65.0s)]
*  Antibodies against COVID-19 do this by blocking what is known as a spike protein on the virus's surface. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=69.0s)]
*  This protein normally helps the virus latch onto and infect cells. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=76.0s)]
*  But for some people, their immune system doesn't produce enough antibodies to fight off the virus, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=80.0s)]
*  or it doesn't produce them fast enough. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=85.0s)]
*  This is where antibody drugs, like the ones that Regeneron and Eli Lilly produce, come into play. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=88.0s)]
*  To manufacture these drugs, researchers isolate what are called B cells from a recovered patient's blood. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=94.0s)]
*  B cells are a type of immune system cell that makes antibodies. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=100.0s)]
*  In the lab, the B cells are then mixed with spike proteins derived from the coronavirus. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=103.0s)]
*  When scientists identify the B cells that are best at latching on to the spike proteins, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=109.0s)]
*  they isolate the genes inside the cells that produce the most effective antibodies. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=114.0s)]
*  These genes are then placed inside cells and are grown in bioreactors to create new antibodies. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=119.0s)]
*  And these highly specific antibodies are concentrated into a liquid solution [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=125.0s)]
*  and then injected into sick COVID-19 patients. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=130.0s)]
*  This gives the body a temporary boost of antibodies that help it fight off infection. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=133.0s)]
*  In clinical trials, Regeneron's drug, which is a combination of two types of antibodies, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=138.0s)]
*  reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 70% in people with mild to moderate symptoms. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=143.0s)]
*  This is a big reason why treatment guidelines from major health organizations [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=149.0s)]
*  now recommend the use of monoclonal antibody drugs for certain patients. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=153.0s)]
*  So this is a major breakthrough in the care of COVID-19 patients. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=158.0s)]
*  We have expanded our tools to treat patients with COVID-19, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=164.0s)]
*  and this is our first recommendation for a therapeutic for those patients with mild, moderate disease. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=169.0s)]
*  The World Health Organization also recommends the use of Regeneron's antibody drug for patients who are severely ill. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=174.0s)]
*  Giving them this additional antibody seems to show an effect. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=181.0s)]
*  And what effect is that? A reduction in mortality. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=185.0s)]
*  As many hospitals continue to be overwhelmed, demand for antibody drugs remains high. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56aGuxEw_QQ&t=188.0s)]
