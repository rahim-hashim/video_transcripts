# This Toxic, Drying U.S. Lake Could Turn Into the ‘Saudi Arabia of Lithium' | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ)
*  Underneath the Salton Sea's toxic lake bed is an estimated 18 million metric tons of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=0.0s)]
*  lithium suspended in hot geothermal brine. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=6.04s)]
*  That's enough to power more than 375 million EV batteries. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=9.36s)]
*  California's largest lake has the world's biggest concentration of lithium in geothermal [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=14.8s)]
*  brine, which could make the U.S. self-sufficient in the mineral. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=19.68s)]
*  It's a revival for the area, which was a thriving vacation spot until the 1960s. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  The miracle sea in the desert, the Salton Sea. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=28.24s)]
*  But today, the shrinking lake is an environmental disaster, leaving behind toxic dust in the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=32.8s)]
*  surrounding desert community. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=38.36s)]
*  Still, the Salton Sea region presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=40.04s)]
*  But seizing that opportunity isn't easy. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=45.12s)]
*  Getting to all that lithium requires new tech, like this, to stand up against the corrosive [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=47.76s)]
*  conditions. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=52.64s)]
*  At stake is hundreds of billions of dollars worth of lithium and thousands of white-collared [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=53.959999999999994s)]
*  jobs. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=58.16s)]
*  Here's how companies are racing to develop new ways to extract lithium from this toxic [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=59.16s)]
*  lake, and whether that will provide a lifeline or be a threat to the surrounding Imperial [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  Valley. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=68.64s)]
*  This resource is really high up there in terms of both sustainability and scalability as [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=71.32s)]
*  well. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=76.16s)]
*  David Dieck leads strategy and development at Energy Source Minerals, one of three companies [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=77.36s)]
*  competing to extract lithium at the Salton Sea. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=82.19999999999999s)]
*  Inside this nondescript shipping container is the pilot version of the tech that could [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=85.6s)]
*  give this area new life. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=89.6s)]
*  Part of what makes the Salton Sea unique is its huge reserve of geothermal brine, a mix [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=92.1s)]
*  of superheated salty water rich in minerals. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  That geothermal brine has been mined for green energy since the 1980s. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=99.8s)]
*  But companies are now eyeing something even more valuable than steam power — lithium. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  Energy Source is developing a less resource-intensive way to extract it from the brine. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=110.52s)]
*  Right now, most of the world's lithium is extracted from Australia's open pit mines [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=115.52s)]
*  or South America's evaporation ponds. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=120.08s)]
*  Both processes are water-intensive and can create a lot of contamination and waste. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=122.84s)]
*  The new method is called direct lithium extraction, or DLE, and it adds just a few steps to the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=128.54s)]
*  geothermal energy generation already happening at the Salton Sea. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=134.32s)]
*  Once that geothermal energy is pulled out, the brine is deposited back into the reservoir. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=138.64s)]
*  What we're working on is a process for which we intercept that return process where we [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=143.64s)]
*  will then extract lithium and turn that into product. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=149.04s)]
*  Lithium extraction begins here, where brine is passed to this machine, full of plastic [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=152.48s)]
*  tubes and columns, carrying what's called an adsorbent. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=157.29999999999998s)]
*  This is our secret sauce. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  The way it works is that it's a very high surface area material. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=162.6s)]
*  Think of it as sort of like a sponge that's selectively absorbing lithium and nothing else. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  In those same columns, the company strips the lithium out of the adsorbent with water. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=172.5s)]
*  We are comfortably extracting over 90 percent of the lithium that comes out. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=177.18s)]
*  That's double what can be extracted from brine using more traditional methods like evaporation ponds. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=181.54s)]
*  The final product is this clear solution, purified lithium chloride. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=186.82s)]
*  We can further process this into a solid product that we can package and send out to battery [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=191.3s)]
*  makers and EV producers. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=197.82s)]
*  The company plans to start building the commercial facility in 2024, with commercial lithium [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=199.66s)]
*  production beginning in 2027. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  Once it's built, Energy Source expects to process 20,000 metric tons of lithium every [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=206.94s)]
*  year, enough for half a million EV batteries alone. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=211.64s)]
*  Ford has already signed on to buy some of that supply. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=215.57999999999998s)]
*  While Energy Source is gearing up to go commercial, there's competition on its heels. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=218.7s)]
*  Berkshire Hathaway Energy currently operates 10 of the 11 geothermal plants around the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=223.26s)]
*  Salton Sea. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=227.82s)]
*  They own most of the resource and they will dominate eventually the production of lithium [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=229.06s)]
*  down here. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=232.62s)]
*  Meanwhile, a third player, Controlled Thermal Resources, is working to catch up. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=233.62s)]
*  Unlike the other two companies, CTR doesn't currently own or operate a geothermal plant. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=238.5s)]
*  But in January, it began construction on the first phase of its lithium facilities, which [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=243.9s)]
*  will produce 25,000 tons of lithium product every year. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=248.42000000000002s)]
*  That's more than four times the amount the U.S. currently produces. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=251.74s)]
*  All this interest has turned the area into… [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=255.46s)]
*  What we refer to as the Saudi Arabia of lithium. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=258.02s)]
*  Right now, the U.S. makes less than 1% of the world's total lithium supply, most of [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=261.78s)]
*  which is mined in Nevada. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=266.58s)]
*  The Salton Sea's reserves could transform domestic production. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=268.4s)]
*  They are estimated to contain enough lithium to ultimately produce nearly half of current [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=271.18s)]
*  global output. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=275.78s)]
*  It is used in everything from electric vehicle batteries to battery storage to cell phones. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=276.78s)]
*  And so the opportunity to potentially recover lithium in such a high volume is of particular [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=281.78s)]
*  interest. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=288.21999999999997s)]
*  It's taken years to get to this point, and it will still be years before any lithium [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=289.21999999999997s)]
*  production begins at a commercial scale. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=293.17999999999995s)]
*  This type of brine that comes from this region, it is highly mineralized. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=295.53999999999996s)]
*  Many elements of the periodic table you will find in this brine. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=299.53999999999996s)]
*  And it's very hot, which means that it can be quite a corrosive brine. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=302.7s)]
*  A lot of this tubing and processing is done with plastics or with special non-corrosive [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=306.98s)]
*  metals. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=312.94s)]
*  The drying Salton Sea itself makes extraction even more difficult. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=313.94s)]
*  Ten years ago, the water was up to the edge of the volcano, and it's now receded off [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=318.98s)]
*  into the distance. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=324.82s)]
*  Since 1999, the Salton Sea has shrunk by more than 30%. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=326.54s)]
*  The receding shorelines, fueled by drought, have decimated the region's ecosystems and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=331.26s)]
*  exposed more than 30,000 acres of toxic lakebed. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=335.64s)]
*  The current sea, which formed in the early 1900s, has been maintained largely due to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=339.44s)]
*  agricultural runoff. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=344.84s)]
*  But associated with that runoff are pesticides and fertilizer components. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  It's this material that gets airborne and generates dust that creates asthma problems [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  in children and the elderly. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  That toxic dust is laced with bacteria, heavy metals and carcinogens like DDT, threatening [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  the community and growing workforce that a multi-billion dollar lithium industry would [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=365.1s)]
*  bring to the region. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=369.54s)]
*  In order for the lithium economy to be successful down here, they need to have a healthy workforce. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=371.02000000000004s)]
*  You don't want to bring in a workforce that's going to have chronic asthma all the time. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=375.34000000000003s)]
*  Some Imperial Valley residents are concerned lithium extraction could worsen the region's [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=379.1s)]
*  environmental issues. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=383.5s)]
*  Right now, it's unclear how operations could affect health problems. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=385.38s)]
*  That's why some community leaders, like Luis Olmedo, say the lithium industry should [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=389.82000000000005s)]
*  spearhead efforts to tackle the toxic dust. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=394.14s)]
*  Olmedo is the executive director of Comite Civico del Valle, a nonprofit that advocates [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=397.38s)]
*  for environmental justice. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=402.53999999999996s)]
*  We're predominantly communities of color, farmworking communities, low-income communities. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=404.38s)]
*  Part of our role is to make sure that there are fair and equitable negotiations. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=408.3s)]
*  Imperial County has the highest unemployment rate in California, and nearly a quarter of [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=414.34s)]
*  children live in poverty. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=418.59999999999997s)]
*  But jobs in the lithium industry promise a new way of making ends meet. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=420.5s)]
*  Imperial County estimates the industry could bring as many as 81,000 jobs to the region. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=424.66s)]
*  While the lithium industry could bring an economic boost, water use remains a concern [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=430.46s)]
*  in a region that receives just three inches of rainfall each year. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=434.66s)]
*  The main use of water in the Imperial Valley is for agriculture. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=438.38s)]
*  If we want to have a successful lithium industry here, we've got to make sure some of that [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=441.82s)]
*  water gets used for lithium processing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=445.46s)]
*  In January, Comite Civico del Valle filed a notice of intent to sue the county after [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=448.1s)]
*  it approved the plans for controlled thermal resources new lithium facilities. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=453.5s)]
*  Overuse of Colorado River water and industry pollution were two of the key complaints. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=458.06s)]
*  In a statement, the county said that since the beginning of Lithium Valley, it has worked [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=463.1s)]
*  to guarantee that residents and communities directly benefit from the economic and environmental [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=467.26000000000005s)]
*  advancements these developments herald. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=472.26000000000005s)]
*  As momentum for lithium extraction builds, community leaders want to see written agreements [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=474.8s)]
*  from companies on their community commitments. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=479.3s)]
*  We want them to be able to do business here, but everyone in this community that is doing [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  business here needs to do their own investments and making sure they mitigate their pollution. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=488.28000000000003s)]
*  In a step towards ensuring the community benefits, Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation allowing [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VagERjB-KZQ&t=494.72s)]
