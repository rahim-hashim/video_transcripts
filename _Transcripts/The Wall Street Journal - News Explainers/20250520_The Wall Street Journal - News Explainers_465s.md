# Space Force Chief on Why China, Russia Are a ‘Substantial’ Threat | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ)
*  You might have heard that the U.S. has a space force. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=0.0s)]
*  But you may not be aware of just how much the military relies on space force assets. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=3.2s)]
*  For things like detecting missile launches, guiding warships, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=8.8s)]
*  launching precision strikes and spying on adversaries. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=12.48s)]
*  But as space becomes more crowded and contested, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=16.0s)]
*  U.S. space systems are facing a growing array of threats. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=19.12s)]
*  It's one of China's most ambitious space missions yet. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=22.56s)]
*  Russian nukes in space. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=25.6s)]
*  Alarm bells were sounding throughout Washington. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=27.52s)]
*  And the space force says it's shifting to a warfighting posture. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=30.08s)]
*  We have to secure our nation's interests in, from and to space. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=33.68s)]
*  It's as simple as that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=37.12s)]
*  We traveled to the Pentagon in January to learn more about how countries like Russia and China [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=38.24s)]
*  are trying to challenge U.S. dominance in space. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=42.72s)]
*  And how the space force is working to stay on the leading edge. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=45.6s)]
*  The space force became its own branch of the military just four years ago. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  And its leader is General Chance Saltzman, the second ever chief of space operations. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=53.44s)]
*  What has the space force accomplished in those four years that you think shows [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=58.32s)]
*  why the space force should be its own military branch? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=62.4s)]
*  First and foremost, we have elevated the discussion of space [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=65.36s)]
*  inside the Department of Defense to a service level. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=69.52s)]
*  And that's not inconsequential. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=72.56s)]
*  Every discussion that happens in the Joint Chiefs of Staff sessions, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=74.24s)]
*  I can bring a space perspective. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=77.6s)]
*  That never happened when there wasn't a space force. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=79.52s)]
*  During Desert Storm in the 1990s, the U.S. began using space technologies [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=82.0s)]
*  like GPS and satellite communications to fight wars. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=86.32s)]
*  And for decades, those systems advanced without facing any serious challenges. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=89.68s)]
*  Then in 2007, China first demonstrated that it could shoot down a satellite with a missile, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=94.8s)]
*  an event General Saltzman observed from the Joint Space Operations Center. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=100.32s)]
*  What was that day like? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=104.16s)]
*  I think we all realized space is not the same after this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=105.12s)]
*  That this is now a contested environment. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=108.32s)]
*  There are operational weapons systems that are going to hold at risk the satellites that we hold dear. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=110.24s)]
*  And now we have to respond. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  Have there been any other days similar to the gravity of that day that you've experienced? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=115.83999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, two come to mind. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=120.16s)]
*  One, the Russians did the same thing in 21 where they destroyed a satellite. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=121.52s)]
*  But the other one is the hypersonic test that the Chinese did. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=126.96s)]
*  That's a game changer. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=130.32s)]
*  That's a space to ground weapon. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  Since then, the threats and competition have only grown. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=132.95999999999998s)]
*  The U.S. still has by far the most satellites in orbit, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=136.88s)]
*  including commercial, government and military spacecraft. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=140.56s)]
*  But adversaries have been racing to catch up and develop ways to take out U.S. systems. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=143.76s)]
*  How big of a challenge does China pose in space? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=148.88s)]
*  Substantial. I think that's the best way to describe it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=151.76s)]
*  Two things worry me most about it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=154.32s)]
*  One is the quality of the capabilities that they're putting on orbit [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  and the pace with which they're putting them on orbit. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=160.0s)]
*  There's just a number of weapons systems that actually can cause us problems [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=162.32s)]
*  that we're going to have to contend with in that contested space. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=166.16s)]
*  And they are developing them very rapidly. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=169.04s)]
*  What about Russia? Does Russia continue to be a space power or a space threat? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=171.12s)]
*  Absolutely. We monitor and assess that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  They are still investing in their space capabilities. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=178.0s)]
*  They still have the intentions to build weapons for space. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  And we are monitoring, assessing and responding to them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  Both Beijing and Moscow have been racing to develop a range of space weapons. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=186.0s)]
*  Some of those on the ground include lasers and high-powered microwaves [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=190.56s)]
*  that can blind space sensors, jammers that can disrupt GPS and communications, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=194.16s)]
*  and more missiles that can take out satellites. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=199.12s)]
*  They've also been developing space weapons, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=201.68s)]
*  like satellites that could kidnap others out of orbit, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=203.92s)]
*  and even nuclear-armed space weapons that could destroy [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=206.88s)]
*  a huge amount of military and civilian spacecraft. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=209.76s)]
*  The Pentagon doesn't discuss its own offensive space capabilities. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  And while the U.S. says China remains the pacing threat, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=217.04s)]
*  intelligence about a Russian effort to develop a nuclear weapon for space [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  has rocked Washington, news that broke in the weeks after we spoke with General Saltzman. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=224.0s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal has reported that Russia launched a research spacecraft [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=228.72s)]
*  to test components for the nuke two years ago, just before its invasion of Ukraine. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=232.48s)]
*  On the conflict in Ukraine, General Saltzman said it has served as a wake-up call [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=237.6s)]
*  about how important space technologies are on the battlefield. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=241.44s)]
*  Right out of the gate, we learned how critical space was going to be [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=245.2s)]
*  because both sides started attacking the other side's space capabilities. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=248.08s)]
*  You don't attack things that are irrelevant. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=251.44s)]
*  You attack things that are important. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=253.12s)]
*  Is there any concern that Russia, China, North Korea, Iran could collaborate [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=254.56s)]
*  and do more together in space? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=259.68s)]
*  Yes. Where they have weaknesses in one area, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=261.76s)]
*  they make up for it with a partnership in another. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=264.0s)]
*  And they have shown inclinations to do that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=266.24s)]
*  To contend with evolving threats, the Space Force sees strength in numbers, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=269.2s)]
*  a concept known as proliferation. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=273.04s)]
*  Take this missile warning system, which scans for infrared heat signatures, as an example. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=275.36s)]
*  Instead of operating just a handful of satellites for a specific mission, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=280.64s)]
*  which could be vulnerable to attack, the Space Force aims to operate [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=284.32s)]
*  a huge number of smaller satellites across different orbits. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=287.92s)]
*  It's a concept that SpaceX has proven with its network of thousands of Starlink satellites. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=291.76s)]
*  That's a much more resilient architecture because an adversary has a lot harder time [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=296.72s)]
*  disrupting thousands of satellites than it would one or two. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=301.6s)]
*  For help fielding these massive constellations of satellites, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=305.52s)]
*  the Space Force is seeking to leverage American innovation and lean on commercial companies, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=308.64s)]
*  a major shift from the old model of the government owning and operating space systems. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=313.28s)]
*  What has the explosion of private capital in the space space meant for you? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=318.0s)]
*  Access to more mission set. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=323.84s)]
*  The cost of launch per pound orbit used to be very high. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=325.2s)]
*  As they've dropped the launch costs, we've been able to think about, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=328.88s)]
*  well, maybe we can do this mission from space now [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  because we can launch more satellites at a cheaper price point. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=334.32s)]
*  So it's viable. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=338.16s)]
*  When you launch satellites, space planes, other missions, you're using private rockets. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=339.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=345.12s)]
*  Is the Space Force too dependent on private companies right now? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  That's not the way I would describe it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  The military, really we don't build things ourselves. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=350.88000000000005s)]
*  We rely on companies to build them for us and we contract them to build it, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  whether it's a tank or an airplane or a rocket in this case. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=357.6s)]
*  As long as we have competitive services, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=360.96000000000004s)]
*  then we're in good shape executing taxpayer dollars. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=363.68s)]
*  So where do the Space Force's nearly 14,000 Guardians stationed across the country [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=366.24s)]
*  and around the world come into play? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  Among other things, they're responsible for supporting launches [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=373.36s)]
*  and operating different types of spacecraft critical to military operations [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  like GPS satellites, missile warning sensors, surveillance equipment, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=380.64s)]
*  weather tracking instruments and satellite communications gear. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=384.56s)]
*  Guardians also track thousands of other satellites and pieces of space debris [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  across various orbits and protect ground systems that are critical to satellite operations. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=391.76s)]
*  There's national interest beyond the military with military space systems. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=396.8s)]
*  And so we have to have access. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=400.64s)]
*  We have to be able to launch continuously put new spacecraft in orbit. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=402.15999999999997s)]
*  We have to protect the domain in space from potential adversaries, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=405.44s)]
*  as well as just trajectories, like I said, that could be unsafe. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=410.48s)]
*  And then from space, we need to make sure that we protect the links [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eS41HczeQ&t=413.76s)]
