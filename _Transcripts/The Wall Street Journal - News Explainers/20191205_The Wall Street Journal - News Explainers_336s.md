# The $3.7 Trillion Corporate Debt Question | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 05, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA)
*  This chart looks at investment grade corporate debt, or debt that ratings firms consider [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=0.0s)]
*  pretty safe. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=5.72s)]
*  There's a lot of it out there right now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=6.72s)]
*  Over the past decade, companies borrowed more and more as interest rates hovered near zero. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Now analysts are concerned. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  That's because about half of that debt, or $3.7 trillion, is rated triple B, the lowest [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=16.2s)]
*  rating investment grade debt can receive. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=22.66s)]
*  And some are worried this debt isn't as safe as the ratings suggest. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=25.18s)]
*  Companies that make well-known products like Campbell's Chicken Soup and Elmer's Glue [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=30.14s)]
*  have had debt rated triple B. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=34.58s)]
*  Analysts say the debt could be a mess in the making, especially if the economy enters a recession. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=36.76s)]
*  To understand why investors are concerned, you need to understand how corporate debt [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=48.34s)]
*  is rated. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=52.96s)]
*  Think of these ratings as credit scores for corporations. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=53.96s)]
*  But instead of using numbers, ratings firms assign letter grades from A to D. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=57.26s)]
*  The higher the grade, the less likely the company is to default on its debt. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=62.46s)]
*  Each one of those ratings is broken down further into triple, double, and single letter categories. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=67.02s)]
*  So triple A debt is safer than single A. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=72.78s)]
*  Triple B debt sits just above an important dividing line. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=76.72s)]
*  Everything above this line is considered higher quality, investment grade debt. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=80.7s)]
*  Everything below is considered risky, or junk debt. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=86.02000000000001s)]
*  It carries a higher risk of default. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=89.76s)]
*  The worry is that if the economy takes the turn, some triple B debt will slide into junk [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=92.4s)]
*  territory. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=97.22s)]
*  A key metric for how these ratings are assigned is leverage. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=99.0s)]
*  Leverage is a ratio of how much debt a company owes compared to its earnings. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=103.86s)]
*  The more debt a company has relative to its earnings, the higher the leverage. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=109.2s)]
*  It's an important factor in determining how safe a company's debt might be. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  Since the financial crisis, companies have a lot more leverage. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=119.88s)]
*  In 2009, corporations had a little over twice as much debt than earnings. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=123.44s)]
*  By 2019, that ratio had increased to about three times earnings. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=129.0s)]
*  And when you just look at triple B rated debt, that ratio is even higher. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=134.26s)]
*  This is what's concerning investors and analysts. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=139.12s)]
*  They say that in the past, companies with this amount of leverage would have been rated [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=142.44s)]
*  in the junk category, which is far riskier. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=145.8s)]
*  This has caused a divisive debate over whether this debt will cause big losses when the economy [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=148.72s)]
*  turns. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=154.16s)]
*  Business debt has clearly reached a level that should give businesses and investors [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=155.36s)]
*  a reason to pause and reflect. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=159.22s)]
*  If financial and economic conditions were to deteriorate, overly indebted firms could [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=161.46s)]
*  well face severe strains. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=165.68s)]
*  For their part, ratings firms like Moody's and S&P say other factors also play a role [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=168.04s)]
*  in assigning ratings. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=173.48s)]
*  Having a solid brand and generating sufficient cash flow to pay bondholders can also influence [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=175.16s)]
*  a company being rated investment grade. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=180.72s)]
*  Ratings firms make predictions about what a company's leverage ratio will look like [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=183.57999999999998s)]
*  in the future. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=187.16s)]
*  For highly leveraged companies, these predictions can serve as a deadline to keep their investment [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  grade status. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=192.92s)]
*  If a company doesn't hit its target, it runs the risk of being downgraded. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=194.28s)]
*  But the amount of time some B-B companies have been given to meet these deadlines has [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=198.08s)]
*  left some investors scratching their heads. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=202.4s)]
*  In 2018, Moody's said the B-B rating for Campbell's Soup was too high after it acquired [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=205.36s)]
*  a snack company for $6.1 billion. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=211.36s)]
*  It estimated the company's leverage had topped five times earnings. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=215.68s)]
*  Moody's gave the company until July 2020 to get it below four times earnings. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=220.28s)]
*  Ratings firms predicted Newell Brands, which makes Elmer's Glue, would reduce its debt [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  load for multiple years. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=232.28s)]
*  When B-B rated Newell announced a multi-billion dollar acquisition in December 2015, S&P [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=234.68s)]
*  and Moody's analysts predicted its leverage ratio would fall from more than five times [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=241.52s)]
*  to under four times earnings by December 2017. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=246.48s)]
*  They continued to make similar predictions that Newell would be a safe bet in 2016, 2017, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=250.6s)]
*  and 2018. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=258.03999999999996s)]
*  But these 2018 calculations failed to account for lost earnings from businesses Newell had [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  sold. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=264.96s)]
*  At the time, Moody's said its calculation was just a different way of measuring leverage. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=265.96s)]
*  An S&P spokesman told The Wall Street Journal that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=271.48s)]
*  Updated calculations from both firms showed Newell's debt was above five times earnings [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=277.36s)]
*  at the end of 2018, revealing that the bonds had been a potentially riskier investment [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=282.6s)]
*  than what the ratings firms indicated. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=287.8s)]
*  S&P downgraded Newell's debt to junk status in November. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=290.36s)]
*  Moody's still rates it B-B. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=294.68s)]
*  But investors still remain skeptical. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=298.20000000000005s)]
*  More than $100 billion in investment-grade debt is trading with yields that are usually [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=301.0s)]
*  associated with junk debt. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=305.24s)]
*  These bonds are rated B-B-, the absolute lowest rung of investment-grade debt. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=307.68s)]
*  The Federal Reserve raised the alarm about the volume of outstanding B-B debt in November, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=314.64s)]
*  saying that widespread downgrades during an economic slowdown could disrupt the liquidity [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=320.12s)]
*  of the corporate bond market, potentially leaving investors in a sticky situation. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGYk0nmcCA&t=325.56s)]
