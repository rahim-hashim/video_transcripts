# Your Coffee Is Getting More Expensive. Hereâ€™s Why | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4)
*  It's not just you. Your daily coffee ritual is getting more expensive. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=0.0s)]
*  If you walk into an American cafe right now, your average coffee drink is going to run you around $4.50. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=5.0s)]
*  Five years ago, it would have cost you just $3.85, nearly a 17% rise in prices. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=12.0s)]
*  That's compared to inflation, which has grown around 10% during the same period. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=18.0s)]
*  That rise is driven by a myriad of economic forces that help determine the cost of your morning cup. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=23.0s)]
*  And now, experts say that due to a major crop loss in 2020, in a matter of months, prices could go up even more. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=29.0s)]
*  We'll explain. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=36.0s)]
*  The price of coffee is driven, in part, by a complex global supply chain, which shapes a more than $460 billion market. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=40.0s)]
*  Most coffee beans are produced in Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=47.0s)]
*  They're then loaded on ships like these and then transported around the world. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=51.0s)]
*  This well-oiled system moves the beans to importing countries like the US, where they're then sold to coffee traders who sell them to roasteries. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=56.0s)]
*  The roasted coffee is then sold to distributors, such as grocery stores and cafes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=64.0s)]
*  Max Cope Steak is a coffee futures broker. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=69.0s)]
*  The trade operates on paper thin margins. It's an extremely competitive business now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=72.0s)]
*  Things like shipping costs are massive. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=76.0s)]
*  During the pandemic, the industry has faced a number of shipping disruptions. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=79.0s)]
*  The shipping container shortage in Southeast Asia has driven up the price of many commodities, including coffee. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=83.0s)]
*  Everything is taking longer to get from one place to the other. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=89.0s)]
*  Containers are piling up in places where they shouldn't be. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=94.0s)]
*  Jose Sachi is the executive director of the ICO, a leading intergovernmental organization for coffee. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=99.0s)]
*  It's not just Southeast Asia. All over the world, we have problems finding sufficient containers. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=105.0s)]
*  So that means that freight rates tend to rise and increase prices. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=112.0s)]
*  Coffee exports are also affected by storms. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=118.0s)]
*  In Nicaragua and Honduras, communities were devastated by hurricanes last year. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=121.0s)]
*  They caused a lot of damage to infrastructure. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=126.0s)]
*  Washed out bridges, landslides that block roads. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=128.0s)]
*  The destroyed roads blocked trade routes. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=133.0s)]
*  And this meant the supply being imported into countries like the US was diminished. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=135.0s)]
*  The concern over a lack of supply helped drive up the price of coffee futures. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=140.0s)]
*  And experts say this could continue. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=145.0s)]
*  As temperature increases, this affects the viability of growing coffee, especially Arabica coffee. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=147.0s)]
*  Robusta, as its name indicates, is robust, is strong, and is harder to be affected by climatic phenomena. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=156.0s)]
*  It's very resistant. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=165.0s)]
*  But Arabica coffee is more delicate. It grows within quite a narrow temperature range. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=167.0s)]
*  Over the past year, the world's largest coffee producer, Brazil, faced a drought that devastated crops. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=175.0s)]
*  The International Coffee Organization says that around 30% of the country's Arabica crop may have been lost. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=182.0s)]
*  This year's coffee yields will also be lower because Brazil is at an off-cycle harvest, which happens every other year. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=188.0s)]
*  The off-cycle is small, and we know that anyway. But this year is extra small. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=195.0s)]
*  And this has got people really spooked because all of a sudden everyone's like, hang on, we need this huge country because we've become so reliant on you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=200.0s)]
*  Merrick-Spectron estimates that the global coffee market will produce millions fewer bags than the previous crop year. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=208.0s)]
*  You can see these factors are pushing up the price of coffee futures. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=215.0s)]
*  But overall, the effects of the drought haven't yet been felt in your local cafe or grocery store. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=219.0s)]
*  With weather becoming more extreme around the world due to climate change, experts say risk to coffee production will continue. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=224.0s)]
*  As temperatures increase, you would expect to find that areas that currently produce Arabica will become too hot. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=231.0s)]
*  And we have to think about ways to mitigate this, whether by different farming techniques or weather. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=242.0s)]
*  And this is a more difficult process, migrating production. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=252.0s)]
*  And as volatile weather increasingly leads to fluctuations in the supply of coffee, demand tends to stay pretty steady. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=257.0s)]
*  This is because coffee is relatively inelastic, meaning that even when the economy fluctuates, people keep buying beans. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=264.0s)]
*  It doesn't change much if prices go up or down. Let me try and explain this in simple terms. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=271.0s)]
*  If prices double in your supermarket next week, you are likely to change your habits to some extent. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=280.0s)]
*  You will maybe switch over to a cheaper brand. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=291.0s)]
*  You may not drink as much coffee outside the home where it is more expensive. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=297.0s)]
*  But it's unlikely you'll stop drinking coffee altogether. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=305.0s)]
*  When the pandemic took hold in March 2020, people were forced to stay home. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=308.0s)]
*  Demand for out-of-home coffee plunged, but demand for in-home coffee rose, making up some of the difference in consumption. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=313.0s)]
*  And as the pandemic continued, another pressure on coffee pricing was playing out in global currencies. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=320.0s)]
*  Coffee future prices are tied to the U.S. dollar and Brazilian real. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=326.0s)]
*  The dollar is a global safe haven in times of economic trouble. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=330.0s)]
*  So during the pandemic, coffee farmers were incentivized to take advantage of the strong exchange rate and sell off their beans. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=334.0s)]
*  The result? Less stored coffee will be available next harvest, when crop yields are expected to be unusually low. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=341.0s)]
*  This is causing an imbalance between the lower supply of coffee and the expected rise in demand. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=348.0s)]
*  And this is why experts say coffee prices are currently lower than they should be. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=354.0s)]
*  They say that this expected rise in prices will affect the entire supply chain. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=358.0s)]
*  And in six to nine months, it could drive up the price of your morning cup even more. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwnCpzukj4&t=363.0s)]
