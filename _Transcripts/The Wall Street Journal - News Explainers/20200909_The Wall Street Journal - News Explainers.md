# Why America's Jobs Recovery Is Different From Other Countries'  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 09, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM)
*  COVID-19 has caused a surge in global unemployment like we've never seen before. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=0.0s)]
*  But in the U.S., jobs have disappeared faster than in any other developed country. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=7.44s)]
*  And then in May, America's unemployment rate began to rebound, while in other developed [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=14.88s)]
*  nations, it remained relatively stable. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  The U.S. also creates a ton of jobs because it's easier to fire people. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=22.88s)]
*  Employers are more confident to hire people. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=28.04s)]
*  So you'd expect the flexible labor markets to move more, I suppose, in response to changes [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=30.24s)]
*  in demand. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=37.0s)]
*  In May and June, the U.S. added about 7.5 million jobs, but the unemployment rate is [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=39.2s)]
*  still at the highest level since the Depression. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=45.36s)]
*  As the pandemic has put us in uncharted territory, we wanted to know, will American jobs bounce [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=49.04s)]
*  back faster than the rest of the world? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=54.08s)]
*  First, it's important to understand what difference a flexible labor market can make. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=57.4s)]
*  In Europe, there's more of a sense that the company has to have a very strong reason to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=61.96s)]
*  be able to fire someone, whereas in the U.S., I think it's much more of a normal part of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=67.16s)]
*  business. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=70.44s)]
*  A flexible labor market has its pros and cons, and proponents say in normal times, it helps [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=72.48s)]
*  keep unemployment low by making it easy for people to move between jobs. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=78.24s)]
*  Just look at the difference in how long people stay at their jobs in the U.S. versus Germany. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=83.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's a different mentality. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=87.08s)]
*  In Germany, it's not a job for life, but the average employment tenure is 10 years [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  at a single company compared with 4.2, I think it is in the U.S. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=93.44s)]
*  After the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. unemployment rate recovered faster than Europe's, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=97.28s)]
*  which also went through a debt crisis. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=103.16s)]
*  So it makes sense that a more flexible labor market would see a bigger jump in unemployment [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=106.12s)]
*  rate during a recession, since it's easier for companies to lay off employees when demand [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=110.24s)]
*  falls. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=114.6s)]
*  But if you look at what happened at the start of the pandemic, you'll see two very different [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=115.91999999999999s)]
*  outcomes for two job markets economists deem flexible. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=119.91999999999999s)]
*  The U.S. saw unemployment rise roughly 11 percentage points from January to April, while [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  Japan's unemployment rate grew half a percentage point. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  That's where different pandemic strategies come in. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=133.72s)]
*  In short, the U.S. chose to give money directly to workers while the economy reboots, while [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=137.82s)]
*  others like Japan and Europe opted to subsidize companies and protect jobs. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=143.78s)]
*  Canada and the U.S. I think have been among the ones that have seen the biggest jump. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=148.73999999999998s)]
*  The main reason, I suppose, is because they've tried to protect workers rather than jobs. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=154.01999999999998s)]
*  They haven't gone for these job furlough schemes on a grand scale, as the Europeans have. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=159.38s)]
*  As part of its first stimulus package, lawmakers sent Americans a $1,200 one-time stimulus [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=167.3s)]
*  check and added $600 a week to unemployment benefits, effectively accepting a wave of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=173.16000000000003s)]
*  job losses. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=179.66000000000003s)]
*  They also funded key industries like aviation to try and prevent or delay some layoffs. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=180.66000000000003s)]
*  Meanwhile, Japan's government allocated nearly $700 billion to business financing and enacted [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=186.18s)]
*  a program to subsidize up to around $140 a day in wages for furloughed employees. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=192.62s)]
*  The EU has invested roughly $120 billion in similar short-term work schemes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=199.3s)]
*  Since those employees are still on the books, even if they're not working, they're not [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=205.66s)]
*  counted as unemployed. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  That works well for those lucky enough to have a permanent job, but it comes at the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  cost of very high unemployment for young people in some countries, or those on temporary contracts. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=215.74s)]
*  I speak to people on furlough and yeah, it's essentially a holiday. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=222.5s)]
*  Obviously, there's nervousness, there's concern about the pandemic, but people are [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=228.38s)]
*  spending their time doing sports or meeting with friends. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=233.3s)]
*  It's a very different experience being without work in Europe at the moment than in the US. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=235.78s)]
*  But the question is, how long can it last? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=241.3s)]
*  The labor cost is only part of what companies are paying. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=244.2s)]
*  You still have to pay for the premises and there's other fees that you have to pay and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=247.26s)]
*  you've got no income. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=251.38s)]
*  So at some point, you'll still have to pull the plug and let those employees go. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=253.06s)]
*  That breaking point is going to depend on how fast economies can recover. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=257.94s)]
*  The longer the pandemic drags on, the more companies could go bust, erasing jobs that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=262.82s)]
*  likely won't be immediately replaced. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=267.5s)]
*  In June, the IMF projected the global economy to grow 5.4% next year, but said recovery [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=270.74s)]
*  is still uncertain. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=277.02s)]
*  In the next two or three years, we'll see which response was better. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=278.72s)]
*  But traditionally, the US labor market has been much more dynamic in kind of reallocating [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=281.68s)]
*  to growth industries. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=287.32000000000005s)]
*  Just look at how the US stock market has outperformed Japan and Europe. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=289.42s)]
*  Some big American companies have done really well throughout the pandemic, and there are [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=294.0s)]
*  high hopes that the companies that have done well will decide to create jobs. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=298.32000000000005s)]
*  While Europe and Japan have kept unemployment rates relatively stable so far, they risk [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  supporting jobs that might not be as valuable by the time the pandemic ends. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=308.52s)]
*  Think aviation or German auto workers producing parts for engines that will likely be phased [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=313.28s)]
*  out. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  Will you want to have exactly the same jobs in place two years down the line? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=319.79999999999995s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=323.24s)]
*  Germany recently allocated $12 billion to expand its job support program until the end [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=324.24s)]
*  of 2021. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=329.28s)]
*  But the future of US business support is still unclear, as lawmakers have to regularly assess [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=331.15999999999997s)]
*  and approve stimulus packages. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=337.12s)]
*  It's just so much uncertainty about how long this is going to last. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  The next big debate will be about the exit strategy and how to phase out some of these [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=342.0s)]
*  programs. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=347.56s)]
*  Even if the US unemployment rate keeps falling, the CBO predicts it'll take more than a [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=348.56s)]
*  decade to reach pre-pandemic levels. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  While other developed countries haven't made such long term projections yet, the ECB forecasts [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=356.12s)]
*  that unemployment in the Eurozone will still be above pre-pandemic levels in 2022. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=361.96s)]
*  A full economic recovery from this pandemic is going to take years, and by the time it's [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=367.64s)]
*  all over, we may be looking at very different labor markets around the world. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhVW92M5KUM&t=372.59999999999997s)]
