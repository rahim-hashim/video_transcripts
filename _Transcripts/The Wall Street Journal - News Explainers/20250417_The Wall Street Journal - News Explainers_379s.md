# Why Companies Like Meta Want to Leave Delaware | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA)
*  Most of the country's biggest companies have one thing in common. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=0.0s)]
*  They're incorporated here in Delaware, a state famous for being business friendly. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=3.36s)]
*  But now, high profile businesses from Dropbox to Roblox to Metta have left or are considering it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=8.0s)]
*  So the state recently passed a law to stop the exodus. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=14.96s)]
*  When we go a little bit off course, we're going to course correct. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=18.0s)]
*  But the course correction itself could risk Delaware's position as the king of U.S. corporate law. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=20.96s)]
*  And its impact could reach beyond boardrooms and into your wallets. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=26.72s)]
*  A lot of the recent attention on Delaware started when the world's richest man wrote this on X, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=30.96s)]
*  never incorporate your company in Delaware. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  That was his reaction to a Delaware court striking down his $46 billion Tesla pay package [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=38.72s)]
*  after a minority shareholders lawsuit. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=43.92s)]
*  That's a classic example of how an individual shareholder that doesn't have a controlling stake [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=46.0s)]
*  could bring a suit saying something's being done to harm the company. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=50.64s)]
*  Really, the fundamental goal of corporate law is to make investors feel comfortable putting their, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=53.84s)]
*  you know, their hard earned retirement dollars in companies. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=60.24s)]
*  If, you know, somebody's coming to me and, you know, a controlled company comes to me and they say, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=65.36s)]
*  you should invest, I might be a little nervous about that, right? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  I might say, I have no idea if you, controlling shareholder, are going to use your influence [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=73.12s)]
*  to make me rich alongside you or whether or not you're going to be taking [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=78.56s)]
*  that investment and using it to, you know, fly in the private jet or extract money in other ways. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=82.72s)]
*  The question at the heart of the controversy is how closely controlling shareholders [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=89.44s)]
*  should be scrutinized by the courts. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=93.76s)]
*  It's boiling up now because [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=95.84s)]
*  This world of the visionary founder, the superstar CEO, who can exert all sorts of leverage, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=97.68s)]
*  it's much more common than it was historically. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=105.84s)]
*  Now, other companies, many of them run by major shareholders, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=108.8s)]
*  have cited Delaware's recent court rulings as reasons for wanting to leave. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=112.08s)]
*  Dropbox announced in January that it had received written consent from its shareholders [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=116.24s)]
*  to reincorporate in Nevada. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=120.64s)]
*  In a note to shareholders, the company wrote that it considered the increasingly litigious [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=122.64s)]
*  environment in Delaware. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=126.72s)]
*  Roblox is asking its shareholders to approve a move to the West too. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=128.24s)]
*  CEO and controlling shareholder David Bazooki wrote that Nevada's corporate law framework [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=132.56s)]
*  and statutory regime aligns with Roblox's culture of innovation [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=137.76s)]
*  and that it provides a supportive, predictable environment. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  Others haven't yet pulled the trigger. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=144.88s)]
*  Meta is considering moving to Texas, according to people familiar with the matter. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=147.04s)]
*  And news site Semaphore reported that Walmart was thinking about leaving too. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  Even with those potential defections, almost 300,000 businesses incorporated in Delaware in 2023. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  It's a huge industry for Delaware. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=162.0s)]
*  So the bigger the company leaves and if that creates a wave, more companies leaving, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=164.24s)]
*  that could be an existential crisis for them. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  Delaware Governor Matt Meyer was tasked with keeping that crisis at bay his first months on the job. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=171.28s)]
*  The issue really moving forward is a lack of predictability. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=176.96s)]
*  That predictability is a key part of what's helped Delaware dominate the business and corporation market. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=181.28s)]
*  You've got a body of law that's relatively well developed. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=186.4s)]
*  You've got expert courts that can hear cases without juries. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=190.88s)]
*  You've got a legislature that's very responsive. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=194.72s)]
*  And you've also got a speedy administrative environment. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=198.32s)]
*  But what sets Delaware apart is the state's business court system. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=202.56s)]
*  They are a bedrock of business operations in the country that people know when writing a contract [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=206.16s)]
*  that it's governed by Delaware law and we know based on over a century of jurisprudence and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=214.0s)]
*  lawmaking what that means. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=220.64s)]
*  But Delaware didn't always have a wealth of cases to build a strong legal framework. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  A hundred years ago, its neighbor New Jersey held the crown for business and corporations. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  And the reason they lost it is they didn't stay to stick to those bedrocks of clarity, consistency, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  predictability and fairness. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=237.6s)]
*  Losing too many businesses could mean peril for Delaware. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  The state makes so much money from incorporating businesses that it was [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=242.72s)]
*  nearly 30 percent of its revenue in 2024. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=245.84s)]
*  At a time when costs are rising so much across our country, Delaware has among the lowest property [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=248.96s)]
*  taxes in the region. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=255.92s)]
*  We have no sales tax and there are other ways that we're able to make Delaware affordable in [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=257.68s)]
*  part because we have we have this amazing court system and this amazing corporate franchise [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=262.96s)]
*  that would have to be looked at if we lost some of that revenue. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=268.16s)]
*  So many companies and attorneys were asking us to create what they call safe harbors. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=270.88s)]
*  That was the genesis of what's now Senate Bill 21, this piece of legislation, to address [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  concerns about the lack of predictability that were the result of these court decisions. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=281.68s)]
*  The governor signed that bill into law in late March, just months after taking office. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=287.6s)]
*  The state law changes the corporate code that would basically limit the ability for shareholders [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=292.48s)]
*  to bring lawsuits in various ways. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=298.24s)]
*  The irony is that the courts, the expertise of judges, that's why Delaware was an attractive [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=300.64s)]
*  place. So I think the critics say if you can just overturn it with a piece of legislation, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=306.64s)]
*  is there even that stability and predictability? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=311.76s)]
*  And why aren't we relying on the expertise of judges and our corporate code? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=314.72s)]
*  The law also explicitly lays out specific guidelines. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=318.32s)]
*  For example, it says that a controlling shareholder has to hold at least a third of the shares. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=321.52s)]
*  You've made it a lot easier for competitors to do what you do, right? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=326.56s)]
*  If all you have is a code that gives rules of the road and you check the box and you've [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=330.4s)]
*  complied, anybody can become Delaware. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  But Meyer argues that leaving Delaware for states like Nevada or Texas is risky for companies [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=341.12s)]
*  looking for predictability. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  If you want to go to Vegas and roll the dice, you go to Vegas and roll the dice. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=348.0s)]
*  Most corporate leaders I know aren't really interested in doing that with their life savings [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=351.2s)]
*  or the business. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=356.08s)]
*  But whether Delaware laws continue to shift or companies move to states that are more [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=357.6s)]
*  favorable to controlling shareholders. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  These changes are going to affect you. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  They're going to affect you because you have your retirement savings invested in an S&P [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=365.44s)]
*  500 tracker fund that's composed of mostly Delaware corporations. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr5mRLdKlEA&t=370.96000000000004s)]
