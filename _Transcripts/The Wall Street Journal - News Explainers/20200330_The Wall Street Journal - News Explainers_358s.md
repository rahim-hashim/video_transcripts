# Dissecting the Markets: WSJ Reporters Explain Last Week's Volatility | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 30, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k)
*  So today was the day that it became very clear the Fed will do whatever it can to keep the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=0.0s)]
*  economy and the markets functioning. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=25.68s)]
*  The Fed rolled out two new lending facilities for the first time, lending directly to big [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=27.76s)]
*  U.S. companies. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=33.44s)]
*  And it also brought back some facilities we haven't seen since 2008. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=34.44s)]
*  So when the Fed wants, in a pinch like this, to get money out into the economy, it starts [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  by buying the safest assets out there. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  It buys its own debt back, U.S. Treasury bonds. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=44.16s)]
*  So they started last week buying Treasury and other government debt. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=46.72s)]
*  And then on Friday, they said they would start buying municipal bonds. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=49.64s)]
*  What you're starting to see now is that that's not enough. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=54.0s)]
*  The Fed is going really a step down to slightly more risky assets, which is corporate debt. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=56.76s)]
*  So they're going to buy corporate bonds, going to shoot corporate loans. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  And that's a really unprecedented step. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=65.84s)]
*  The markets did not respond well at all. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=68.68s)]
*  The Dow and the S&P, the big stock indexes, end of the day down about 3 percent. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=70.48s)]
*  They're now off 30 percent or so from their highs just a month or two ago. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=75.32s)]
*  The market had its best days since 1933 today, and that was due to lawmakers getting close [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=80.68s)]
*  to signing a massive stimulus bill to help the economy. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  The Dow finished up 11 percent today and the S&P 500 added 9.4 percent, which marked its [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=92.68s)]
*  best day since 2008. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  Markets have actually been very volatile the last couple of weeks, and it's not been [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=100.44000000000001s)]
*  unusual to see these really big down days followed immediately after by really big up [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=105.28s)]
*  days. For instance, even though we had the biggest gain for the Dow since 1933 today, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=109.92s)]
*  we've also within the last couple of weeks seen some of the stock market's worst falls [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=115.64s)]
*  in history on March 9th, March 12th and March 16th. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=120.2s)]
*  Wednesday was another really volatile day in the stock market. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=127.52s)]
*  The S&P 500 rose as much as 5 percent in the afternoon before ending the day up 1.2 [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  percent. So it was another crazy day for investors and all of us financial journalists [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=137.39999999999998s)]
*  watching at home. Stocks closed positive for two days in a row. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=142.48s)]
*  That's the first time that's happened since February 12th. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  Wednesday's moves came with traders and investors really checking on Congress every five [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=149.88s)]
*  minutes or so to see where the economic stimulus package stands. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=155.16s)]
*  So markets rose a lot on anticipation that it would pass, and they paired some of the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=159.4s)]
*  gains on signs that maybe it won't be as smooth. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  One of the most fascinating things about Wednesday's moves was the massive swings in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  airline stocks and Boeing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  Boeing, which is a big component of the Dow, rose 24 percent. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's the positive side for some people who track short term gains, but bigger [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=178.88000000000002s)]
*  pictures, some investors are still really worried about the intraday swings and how [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  big they are. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=187.8s)]
*  We're also waiting to see, again, hard economic data. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=189.16s)]
*  What's been really crazy is how fast this has all happened in only a few weeks. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=192.76s)]
*  We actually haven't seen much hard data yet showing the really big slowdown we're all [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=197.28s)]
*  preparing for. As those data points start coming in, whether they're worse than [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=202.2s)]
*  expected or somewhat better than feared, things like that could really shape how markets [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=207.28s)]
*  swing over the coming days and into next week, too. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  Today, we saw that jobless claims hit a record high. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=219.0s)]
*  The number of people applying for unemployment benefits hit a record three point three [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  million. So that's a sign of how this coronavirus is taking a toll on on humans and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  the economy. It's really hard to overstate how bad this number was. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=234.2s)]
*  You know, this was above numbers that we saw during the global financial crisis, and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=238.76s)]
*  it's nearly five times the previous high that we've ever seen. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  So there's this huge disconnect out there. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=247.96s)]
*  You get these really, really dark figures on jobless claims, the worst that we've [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=250.44s)]
*  ever seen. And on the other hand, you have stocks soaring. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=255.16s)]
*  They just ripped higher. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=258.64s)]
*  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6 percent and it just logged its best three [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  day streak since the 1930s. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=266.44s)]
*  Some people think that we can actually have a pretty speedy recovery in the third and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=269.6s)]
*  fourth quarters of this year. And other people think that, hey, we don't know. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=273.92s)]
*  We could be in for a prolonged downturn. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=277.08s)]
*  So stocks ended Friday down, bucked three days of gains, despite some pretty [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=281.72s)]
*  encouraging signs out of Washington where the big coronavirus A bill did get passed [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=288.04s)]
*  and signed by the president. So stocks had a tough day. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  That said, there were some more encouraging signs out of the credit markets, in [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=295.56s)]
*  particular, demand for this emergency funding that the Federal Reserve has been [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=299.84s)]
*  providing overnight dramatically fell. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=305.08s)]
*  It's this very crucial part of the funding markets, and it literally keeps lights on [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  overnight at banks and companies all around America. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=312.12s)]
*  Two weeks ago, when the Fed rolled out its repo facility, it had more than 250 [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=315.52s)]
*  billion dollars of demand. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=320.84s)]
*  People in the market saying, I need cash. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=322.32s)]
*  Today, it had only just a little bit above 10 billion. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  And so that tells you that the private market is starting to do its job again. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=327.4s)]
*  And maybe the Fed isn't needed quite so much there. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=331.56s)]
*  One thing that's important to remember is this is at the end of the day, a health [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=334.08s)]
*  crisis. And the bill that comes through Congress certainly has has about 150 [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=337.52s)]
*  billion dollars for hospitals. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=341.08s)]
*  It has aid for municipalities. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=342.36s)]
*  But it can't it can't fight the virus on its own. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=344.88s)]
*  And so markets are still going to be pretty, pretty concerned until there's better [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=347.68s)]
*  data on the coronavirus front. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0Gl08yU4k&t=353.08s)]
