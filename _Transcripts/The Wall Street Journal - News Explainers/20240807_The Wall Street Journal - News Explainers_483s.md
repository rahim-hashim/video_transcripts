# Why Banks Bet Big on Risky Credit Card Partnerships | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c)
*  As much as $10 million, that's how much Wells Fargo is losing every month thanks to this credit card. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=0.0s)]
*  You can finally earn points on rent. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=6.8s)]
*  Bill got a very sweet deal, but Wells needed a win. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=10.08s)]
*  Despite high-profile failures, these types of credit card partnerships make up 62% of the portfolios of the largest issuers in the U.S. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=13.6s)]
*  And experts say the industry will continue to grow. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=22.04s)]
*  Here's how these complex partnerships work and what some missteps reveal about what's at stake. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=25.44s)]
*  A co-branded partnership is one where a bank teams up with a company. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=31.44s)]
*  It's as broad as that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=38.08s)]
*  Brands that have credit card partnerships run the gamut, from airlines to retailers. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=39.28s)]
*  It's any company that is looking to build up loyalty from their existing customers and to pull in new customers. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=43.92s)]
*  In return, customers earn rewards, anything from discounts to a free hotel night. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=53.04s)]
*  For free. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=57.84s)]
*  Boom. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=59.64s)]
*  And the banks that team up with brands to issue the cards are looking to cash in on that loyalty. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=60.6s)]
*  Ultimately, it's meant to be a win-win for the bank and for the partner that they're teaming up with, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=65.68s)]
*  where they will both see more customers and more revenue from this partnership. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=71.32s)]
*  There's also a third player involved, the Card Network. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=75.64s)]
*  The Card Network's Visa and MasterCard basically make money when more volume goes over their networks. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=79.04s)]
*  Generally speaking, these brand partnerships bring large numbers of high spending consumers. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=84.48s)]
*  So how do these players work together? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=90.16s)]
*  Take the Amazon Prime Visa credit card. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=92.44s)]
*  Amazon is the brand in the partnership, and users can earn rewards on its site and elsewhere. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=94.8s)]
*  Visa is the card network that allows customers to use this card anywhere Visa cards are accepted. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=100.0s)]
*  And Chase is the issuing bank. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=105.92s)]
*  Whatever revenue is generated from these cards, whether it's just from the way that the consumer is shopping, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=108.28s)]
*  to whether they're paying their balances in full every month or not, to whether they are paying on time or not, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=113.64s)]
*  that is money that's all up for grabs between the bank and their partner, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=120.28s)]
*  and they determine how they're going to split that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=124.96s)]
*  Those merchant partners can also make money every time someone opens a new account, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=127.16s)]
*  and banks often pay brands for rewards, like miles, offered to customers. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  Those reward purchases can make up the biggest chunk of payments banks make to their partners. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=136.67999999999998s)]
*  The rewards basically encourage the consumer to spend even more on that card. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=141.64s)]
*  In 2022, banks paid merchants an average of $279 for every open account. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=146.92s)]
*  Delta made nearly $7 billion from its Amex credit card partnership in 2023. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=152.88s)]
*  In general, it's been kind of a race to the top, if you will, in terms of how those payments have gone. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=158.16s)]
*  These partnerships are growing in popularity. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=165.2s)]
*  In the U.S., over a third of general-purpose credit cards were co-branded in 2021. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=168.0s)]
*  That's 173 million accounts in the U.S. co-brand industry, and most of them are in the travel and retail space. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=173.32s)]
*  But for all the potential upsides for both brands and banks, some partnerships carry immense risk. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=180.68s)]
*  Wells Fargo launched its splashy partnership with BILT, a fintech startup, in 2022. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=187.0s)]
*  The BILT credit card promised to... [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=192.04s)]
*  turn your rent payments into a dream summer vacation. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=194.04s)]
*  That's a rare perk. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  Most landlords don't accept credit card payments because of the high fees they would need to pay card companies. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=198.6s)]
*  With the BILT card, Wells Fargo agreed to eat much of that cost. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  They started going through this sort of rationale of, well, look, we're going to get access to a lot of young adults. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=208.12s)]
*  We got tons of cardholders in a short amount of time, and it delivered that, like, OK, Wells is serious about being in the co-branded space. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=213.88s)]
*  But according to exclusive WSJ reporting, the partnership is losing the bank millions of dollars a month. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=222.52s)]
*  And Wells Fargo has told BILT it doesn't intend to renew the contract when it expires in 2029, unless the economics are changed more in its favor. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  The bank is paying BILT $200 for every new account. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  It's also making separate payments every time the card is used to pay rent, which is what the program is focused on. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=241.0s)]
*  All of this has resulted in losses, as have the internal projections that Wells Fargo made as to how consumers would use this card turned out to be wrong. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  And the bank has stopped bidding on new co-brand programs altogether. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=258.08s)]
*  In a comment, Wells Fargo said that co-brands are one modest piece of the company's credit card strategy and the BILT card is one component. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=262.12s)]
*  And BILT said it is committed to the partnership and that any insinuation of either party looking to exit the partnership is inaccurate. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=269.76s)]
*  Wells Fargo isn't the only bank to make a miscalculation. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=276.76s)]
*  We saw an opportunity to transform another fundamental method of payment. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's the credit card. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=286.44s)]
*  Apple and Goldman Sachs announced the Apple credit card in 2019 to great fanfare. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=288.28s)]
*  Within the first few years, balances on the card grew to over $8 billion. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=293.71999999999997s)]
*  But in the fall of 2023, Apple sent a proposal to Goldman Sachs to exit the contract. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=298.59999999999997s)]
*  The proposal came after the bank decided it would leave the consumer lending space. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=304.12s)]
*  It comes with a lot of costs and a lot of regulatory oversight. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  And all of that basically means a lot of expenses that resulted in the bank losing billions of dollars as it tried to become a massive consumer lender. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=313.0s)]
*  Trying to distinguish itself in the consumer lending space, Goldman Sachs accepted unusual terms from Apple. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  One of the risks here is working, especially when it's the big companies. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=329.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, you want to partner with me and you have to deal with my terms. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=333.28s)]
*  And if you don't deal with my terms, I'm just going to go somewhere else. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=336.96s)]
*  This is AppleCard, a credit card created by Apple, not a bank. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=340.35999999999996s)]
*  For Goldman, agreeing to Apple's terms, like not charging late fees or selling customer data, meant losing valuable income streams. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=345.76s)]
*  You know, another risk is when you have a merchant partner that is insisting on most of the cardholders getting approved, right? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=353.4s)]
*  Well, what if a lot of those cardholders have low credit scores? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=359.4s)]
*  And that results in higher losses for the bank. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=362.28s)]
*  That was a major sticking point in the Goldman Sachs and Apple partnership. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=365.2s)]
*  Apple and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=368.88s)]
*  Introducing the Capital One Walmart Rewards Card. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=371.23999999999995s)]
*  In May, Walmart and Capital One ended their exclusive credit card partnership several years before the contract was slated to end. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=374.2s)]
*  The decision came after Walmart sued Capital One in 2023, alleging that the bank didn't meet certain terms of the contract. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=381.44s)]
*  According to people familiar with the matter, Walmart had wanted to renegotiate some terms of the contract and Capital One wasn't willing to accept its demands. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=388.96s)]
*  Walmart and Capital One declined to comment. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  Ultimately, the economics of these partnerships tend to favor the brands. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=399.96s)]
*  In all likelihood, you know, two thirds or three quarters of the total revenue that's generated by this will go to the brand partner. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  So it does mean that the issuer kind of has less of the overall economics and also in a somewhat residual position because the brand gets paid first. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=411.4s)]
*  The credit card partnerships have proven to be extremely useful to the brand in terms of creating an additional revenue stream, but also creating additional loyalty. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=421.79999999999995s)]
*  For some companies like airlines, no rewards program, no credit card program can be the difference between being in business or not. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=432.56s)]
*  And even when banks don't get a majority of the revenue made through these partnerships, these co-branded cards still provide them a key benefit. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=440.6s)]
*  It brings in customers who the bank may not otherwise have. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=448.0s)]
*  All of this equals what? More customers, more purchase volume equals more revenue. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=451.24s)]
*  And experts don't expect the co-branded credit card industry to stop growing anytime soon. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  I think these will grow faster than the overall credit card industry because you're going to constantly have the brands trying to earn more money from them. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=461.0s)]
*  And the issuers kind of who want to have these larger portfolios of high spending consumers. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJc8iZRxD-c&t=469.4s)]
