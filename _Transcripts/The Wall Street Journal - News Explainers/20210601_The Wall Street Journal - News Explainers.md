# Why Biden’s Infrastructure Plan Calls for Highway Teardowns  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA)
*  Democrats, led by President Biden, say now is the time to build back better. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=0.0s)]
*  The American Jobs Plan will modernize 20,000 miles of highways, roads and main streets [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=6.2s)]
*  that are in difficult, difficult shape right now. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=12.56s)]
*  But leaders don't just want to build and update roads. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=16.76s)]
*  In some cases, they want highways torn down. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=19.88s)]
*  Democrats would like to provide funding to tear down highways that had a damaging effect [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=23.44s)]
*  on urban minority communities. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=27.16s)]
*  Federal funds created the damage done here and federal funds should be used to help remedy it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=29.88s)]
*  Activists in cities like Tampa, Austin, Texas, New Orleans, Detroit and Tulsa, Oklahoma, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=37.04s)]
*  are calling for the removal of highways that they say segregate communities and harm minorities. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=42.76s)]
*  Leaders say there are many more examples, like this road in West Baltimore. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=49.0s)]
*  This is the Franklin Mulberry Expressway. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  Baltimore locals call it the Highway to Nowhere, and some policymakers want to tear it down. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=56.8s)]
*  The road cuts through 1.4 miles of the city, providing a speedy route for cars traveling east to west. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=62.8s)]
*  Like other parts of the country's interstate system, the road was built to provide fast [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=70.36s)]
*  access for traffic from ports and downtown offices to the suburbs. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=74.32s)]
*  But locals like Baltimore City Councilman John Bullock say it's a scar running through [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  the city's west side. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=83.28s)]
*  The reality is that you did have intact businesses, churches, families, community networks that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=85.4s)]
*  were literally torn asunder with this highway going through. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  And yes, there are examples of cities across the country, and Baltimore is no different [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=96.0s)]
*  that during urban renewal you saw the disproportionate effects in neighborhoods that had African [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  American populations. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=105.28s)]
*  Planning for this road dates back to the 1950s, when President Eisenhower called for cities [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=107.72s)]
*  to build better connections to the interstate system. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=112.32s)]
*  His goal was to give the military, traders, and commuters quick routes through the nation. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  In Baltimore, the first round of demolition displaced hundreds of families. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=121.24s)]
*  That sparked a wave of opposition from locals, like then-City Councilwoman Barbara Mikulski, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=125.8s)]
*  who would go on to represent Maryland in Congress as a Democrat. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=130.88s)]
*  The government, under eminent domain, took their housing, cleared that land without any [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=134.56s)]
*  relocation benefits, without a fair market value, and so on. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=138.88s)]
*  Senator Chris Van Hollen is Mikulski's successor. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=145.16s)]
*  What you see here is a part of the highway that was built decades ago, but was never [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=148.24s)]
*  completed because Senator Mikulski and other activists rallied to stop it, and they were [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  successful at stopping the highway, but not before this one-and-a-half-mile segment had [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=162.36s)]
*  been built, displacing over 900 people from their homes, splitting an African American [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=168.96s)]
*  community that had been stable and vibrant. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=175.88000000000002s)]
*  And so here you see this scar. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  Since then, researchers have found that highways create challenging conditions within cities. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  Data collected in Baltimore suggests that air quality is poorest in the sections of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=188.04s)]
*  the city that are near interstate connections. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=192.48s)]
*  The Environmental Protection Agency says that poor air quality can worsen health conditions, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=195.84s)]
*  like asthma. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=200.64s)]
*  The interstate also contributed to out-migration, not only in Baltimore, but in cities across [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=202.68s)]
*  the country, like Detroit. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=207.32s)]
*  Economists say that the highway building in majority-black Detroit contributed to the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=210.56s)]
*  city's economic decline. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=214.56s)]
*  Tax costs for these roads continue to weigh on the city, which filed for bankruptcy in [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=217.12s)]
*  2013. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=221.88s)]
*  This form of structural inequity is what leaders in Washington say they are trying to address. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=224.16s)]
*  Too often investments have failed to meet the needs of marginalized communities left behind. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=229.44s)]
*  Developers today say that tearing down parts of the interstate system could correct a wave [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=235.68s)]
*  of past failures. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=239.6s)]
*  One 2018 review of West Baltimore calls for the demolition of two bridges at the eastern [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  stub of the highway, opening more land for development. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=247.0s)]
*  The plan says the new space could be used for athletic fields, parks, and a new retail [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=252.2s)]
*  center. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  The panel also called for the rehabilitation of vacant lots and nearby row homes, and wider [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=258.66s)]
*  sidewalks for pedestrians. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=263.86s)]
*  If Congress passes an infrastructure bill, the federal funding could help turn some of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=267.34000000000003s)]
*  these ideas into reality. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=271.2s)]
*  West Baltimore community organizer, Eshiya Parker, says she would welcome changes in [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  her part of the city, but she wants to make sure the community has a seat at the table. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=278.64s)]
*  We definitely don't want our federal partners putting up large condos that people aren't [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=283.08s)]
*  able, well, that current residents aren't able to occupy. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  And then we also want to make sure that economic development is done. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=293.71999999999997s)]
*  So produce stores or other type of small businesses for people who are already in a [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=297.28s)]
*  neighborhood that can utilize. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=302.23999999999995s)]
*  Other residents said that they would like for the government to focus on rehabilitating [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  homes in the area before focusing on the roads. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=309.35999999999996s)]
*  The national movement to tear down highways is picking up steam as leaders in Congress [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=314.08s)]
*  from both sides of the aisle signal that they're open to the idea. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=318.28s)]
*  The movement got a boost from President Biden when he called for $20 billion to redress [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=323.04s)]
*  inequities created by past investments in transportation. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=327.88s)]
*  That's just one part of the bigger American jobs plan, which the White House says would [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=332.24s)]
*  cost $1.7 trillion. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=336.36s)]
*  Senate Republicans now say that they are open to a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure plan. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=339.68s)]
*  In short, both parties want to invest more in infrastructure, but they're far apart [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=345.76s)]
*  on the details of how it should be done. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  Republican senators say they're open to using federal funds to remove highways, but [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  they want to leave the decision to state lawmakers. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=358.0s)]
*  There are multiple examples of poor planning decisions that have led to adverse consequences [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=361.08s)]
*  for specific communities. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=365.84s)]
*  None of us deny that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=367.4s)]
*  And I think we all agree they should be rectified. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=368.91999999999996s)]
*  I believe it should be done at the local and state level where decision makers are closest [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=371.88s)]
*  to the people and able to make a balanced decision. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  The call to fund highway removal breaks from years of American transportation philosophy. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=379.12s)]
*  If a bill materializes, highway teardowns could unfold in cities across the country. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNs-XlCrwiA&t=384.32s)]
