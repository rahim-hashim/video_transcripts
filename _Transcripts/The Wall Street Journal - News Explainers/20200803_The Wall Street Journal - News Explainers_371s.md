# How Airlines Can Survive the Pandemic  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE)
*  The Boeing 747. It's the jumbo jet that made long-distance travel more affordable, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=0.0s)]
*  and was the crown jewel of BOAC's fleet, a company you may now know as British Airways. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  By the end of the year, BOAC will have extended its jumbo services around the world on most of its key routes. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=11.52s)]
*  But in 2020, after five decades, BA has decided to bring forward its plans to retire the 747, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=18.0s)]
*  as have other airlines like Qantas and Virgin Atlantic. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=25.36s)]
*  It's a visible sign of how airlines are having to quickly transform themselves to survive the coronavirus pandemic. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=28.96s)]
*  The industry has been decimated. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=35.6s)]
*  Passenger volumes dropped an unprecedented 95% in April, and the industry is set to lose $84 billion this year alone. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=38.64s)]
*  A number of airlines around the world have already gone bust. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  It's a little bit like the game of Survivor. We don't know how long the downturn is going to last. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=51.2s)]
*  So to stay in business, airlines have to move quickly, and face make-or-break choices at a time of zero visibility. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=56.56s)]
*  A first critical choice is whether or not to keep flying, and where to send those planes when demand is so low. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=65.36s)]
*  Flying too many planes means losing money. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=72.80000000000001s)]
*  But flying too few means missing out on passenger demand and potentially losing market share. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=75.68s)]
*  Getting that balance right is absolutely crucial. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=81.36s)]
*  How can I stay in that market? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  How can I continue to be active, but not fly unnecessary journeys with empty aircraft? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  For many airlines, that's the great dilemma. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=92.72s)]
*  Airlines in the U.S. are going about it in very different ways. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=95.12s)]
*  American has said, we're going to take as many people as we can, pack them into the airplane, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=98.64s)]
*  reduce our cash losses each day. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=105.44s)]
*  There are some people who need to travel. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=109.12s)]
*  There are some people who want to travel. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=110.88s)]
*  So let's get them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  Let's get them all. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=114.16s)]
*  But Delta has said it's going to halve the number of planes it's bringing back, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=115.6s)]
*  leaving its capacity around a quarter of what it was last year. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=119.92s)]
*  Taking flights out of your schedule does help you save cash. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=123.44s)]
*  It certainly reduces your daily operating costs. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=127.28s)]
*  And, you know, it's quite simple. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=131.2s)]
*  If you only have enough passengers for one or two flights a day, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=132.88s)]
*  you only want to be flying one or two flights a day. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=135.92s)]
*  Striking the right balance is particularly difficult. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=137.92s)]
*  And airlines can't even rely on their usual forecast data, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=141.04s)]
*  as few customers are planning travel ahead of time. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=144.48s)]
*  They've lost all of their historic data around booking demand, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=147.76s)]
*  when people book, for what routes, how far in advance, how much they're prepared to pay. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=153.2s)]
*  That makes another crucial decision particularly pressing, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  whether or not to keep their staff. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  If you're talking about 50% of the world's fleet being grounded at this moment in time, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=165.12s)]
*  and 50% of the world's capacity not flying at this moment in time, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=168.96s)]
*  you don't need to be a rocket scientist. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=174.24s)]
*  I mean, that probably means 50% of people employed in the aviation industry [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  are not going to be required, certainly through the winter of this year. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=180.32s)]
*  While carriers like Cathay Pacific and Hong Kong have asked their employees to take unpaid leave, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  others like Emirates have laid off staff. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=188.96s)]
*  In the US, airlines that accepted government money under the CARES Act [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=192.16s)]
*  promised not to lay off or furlough workers until the end of September, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=195.84s)]
*  but have looked for other options. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=199.6s)]
*  You know, what they're asking for from employees and labor is usually their number one or number two cost. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  They're asking for forgiveness, voluntary leaves, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=209.12s)]
*  working fewer hours than what's guaranteed in their contracts, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=212.72s)]
*  different relief forms like that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=216.96s)]
*  American has warned 25,000 of its staff that their jobs are at risk once funding expires, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  and United said it's exploring shedding 36,000 employees, nearly half of its US workforce. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  But furloughing specialized workers can have long-term consequences. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  You don't want to furlough a pilot for just a couple months [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=236.88000000000002s)]
*  and then have to bring them back for a couple months of training. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  You don't want to create training cycles where you just jam up your facilities [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  and you can't get the people trained that you need to get trained. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  There are only so many hours in the flight simulators. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=253.44s)]
*  Back to those 747s. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=259.36s)]
*  The jumbo's cruising speed of 625 miles an hour makes relatively short work of the Atlantic flight. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  Huge planes like these, which can sometimes carry more than 500 passengers, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=266.88s)]
*  have become difficult to fill as few people are flying around the world, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=271.84s)]
*  and Boeing has said it will stop producing the 747 altogether in 2022. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=275.68s)]
*  The 747 is an expensive plane to fly. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  Four engines are always more expensive than two engines. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=284.56s)]
*  And the reality is the bigger, older planes are the ones that don't make sense anymore. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=288.32s)]
*  But it's not just a matter of cost. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  The retirement of so many 747s is a huge burden. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=296.64s)]
*  The retirement of so many 747s reveals a much deeper change. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=300.56s)]
*  The aircraft was designed and has been used most recently [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=305.36s)]
*  with quite large proportions of first and business class seats. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=309.36s)]
*  Now, the one thing that is not coming back, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=313.2s)]
*  and is certainly not coming back quickly, is corporate demand. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=315.6s)]
*  Delta CEO Ed Bastion told Analyst he didn't expect corporate flying [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=318.32s)]
*  to ever recover to its pre-pandemic level. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=322.96s)]
*  You can often cover the cost of a flight just filling the business class seats [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=326.32s)]
*  and the health and coach is profit. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=330.48s)]
*  But if that's not the case, if business travel doesn't come back, then what do you do? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=333.12s)]
*  In just a few months, what had been a steadily growing sector for decades [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=339.6s)]
*  has become a huge loss making business for airlines. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=344.16s)]
*  And the choices they make now will likely change the way we fly for years to come. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=347.76s)]
*  Do they have the confidence that they're going to call it correctly? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  Do we know what's going to happen in the future? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  It would be a brave call for any airline to make such a dramatic [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=358.79999999999995s)]
*  change of position in the market so quickly. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kVq9abmDE&t=363.84s)]
