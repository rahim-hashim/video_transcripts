# The British Monarchy's Money, Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig)
*  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have said that they will work to become financially independent from the royal family as they step back from their roles in the British monarchy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=0.0s)]
*  That has raised a potentially awkward question. How does the royal family fund itself in the 21st century? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=10.0s)]
*  It's not something the royal family like to publicise, but here's what we know about their main sources of income. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=16.0s)]
*  There's something called the Duchy of Lancaster. Almost 45,000 acres of commercial, agricultural and residential properties in England and Wales owned on behalf of the Queen. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=22.0s)]
*  The Duchy comprises around $710 million in net assets, which is mostly held in trust. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=32.0s)]
*  The profit made by these sites, castles, historical land and property at the heart of the capital goes directly to the Queen and no other member of the royal family. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=39.0s)]
*  Last year it netted her £20.7 million or $26.7 million. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=49.0s)]
*  Next up there's the Duchy of Cornwall. Like the Duchy of Lancaster, the Duchy of Cornwall is a private estate, except this one is owned on behalf of Prince Charles. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=56.0s)]
*  In 2019, the Duchy of Cornwall paid Charles over $28 million on almost $1.2 billion of net assets. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=66.0s)]
*  Though the profit goes directly to Charles, both Prince William and Prince Harry received money from the Duchy through their father. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=76.0s)]
*  Last year they got around £5 million in total from Prince Charles' fund. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=83.0s)]
*  There are questions whether Harry will have to give up this source of funding if he is to become financially independent. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=88.0s)]
*  Then there's the family's personal wealth. That's the investments, companies and private estates that various royals hold. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=94.0s)]
*  The value of this and what they yield in income is undisclosed. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=101.0s)]
*  For instance, the Queen privately owns the Sandringham estate. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=105.0s)]
*  How much the royal family gains from this income is unknown, but royal biographers estimate the royal family's wealth as in the millions, not the billions. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=109.0s)]
*  That means royals in the 21st century might be rich, but they're not super rich. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=118.0s)]
*  In a move to keep this revenue stream going, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan, have applied to trademark Sussex Royal, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=122.0s)]
*  a brand which will cover a whole host of items ranging from socks to greeting cards. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=130.0s)]
*  The largest source of income for the royals is government money through a thing called the Sovereign Grant. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=135.0s)]
*  In the 1700s, the monarchy handed over revenues from swathes of land to the government known as the Crown Estate. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=141.0s)]
*  Each year, the government pays a percentage of the profits made on those assets back to the monarchy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=148.0s)]
*  That annual income is known as the Sovereign Grant. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=153.0s)]
*  Last year, it amounted to almost $107 million and it paid for royal duties and the maintenance of palaces, including Buckingham Palace. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=156.0s)]
*  Meghan and Harry don't appear to be ready to give up all of those funds. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=165.0s)]
*  The couple's website, SussexRoyal.com, said that they expect to keep state-funded security [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=169.0s)]
*  and they want to continue to live in a cottage owned by the Queen and refurbished at a cost of $3.1 million to the taxpayer. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=175.0s)]
*  The fact that such a large proportion of the royal income effectively comes from taxpayers is part of the reason why there is such public interest in this decoupling. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=182.0s)]
*  The monarchy has spent years trying to rise above such earthly matters as how they are actually paid for [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=191.0s)]
*  and that's one of the reasons why the Meghan and Harry debacle is leaving the monarch feeling uncomfortable. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW6JBwv4lig&t=197.0s)]
