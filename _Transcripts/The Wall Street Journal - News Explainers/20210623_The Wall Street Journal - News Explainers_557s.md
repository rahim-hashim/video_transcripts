# Wuhan Lab Hypothesis or Animal-Human Leap? The Hunt for Covid-19’s Origins | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg)
*  a seafood market, a virology lab, and a mine deep in the mountains. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=0.0s)]
*  Key events at these places in China could be crucial to understanding how a small cluster of coronavirus cases ended up sweeping the world. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=6.0s)]
*  Because almost a year and a half into this global health crisis, politicians and scientists are still debating how it all started. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=13.8s)]
*  If you're going to look for the origin of a pandemic, you really should start right away when the clues are fresh. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=20.36s)]
*  Right now, that's looking pretty difficult. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  That's because access to Wuhan has been really limited. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=27.84s)]
*  Until you nail it down definitively, you've always got to keep an open mind that it might be something else. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=30.88s)]
*  The main hypothesis is that the virus originated from bats, jumped to another animal, then to us. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=37.8s)]
*  And the leap to humans might have happened here, at this market. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=43.92s)]
*  Ten miles away is where some scientists believe that the virus may have accidentally leaked from a lab. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=47.32s)]
*  And both of these spots in Wuhan have an increasingly important connection to one place that's over 1,000 miles away in the mountains of Yunnan province. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=53.32s)]
*  So we visit these key places to break down what we know about the coronavirus to understand how the global pandemic may have started. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=62.08s)]
*  Stop number one, the Huanan Seafood Market, December 31st, 2019. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=70.44s)]
*  This is the day the WHO learned about a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, and increasingly the focus was on the market. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=75.88s)]
*  The complex spans an area that's the size of nine football fields and has over 600 stalls. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=82.76s)]
*  About 10 of those were selling wild animals like bamboo rats, hedgehogs and hog badgers. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=88.28s)]
*  These wildlife are raised on farms, sometimes in crowded conditions where it's easy for animals to spread viruses back and forth between each other. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=94.28s)]
*  And the viruses start to mix and match and can change. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=103.0s)]
*  Some wildlife that are receptive to coronavirus infections are consumed in China, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=107.0s)]
*  either for food or used in traditional medicine. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=111.52s)]
*  These animals are shipped to urban markets where they are sold sometimes live and butchered on site. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=114.16s)]
*  And all this contact with live, possibly infected animals or the infected fresh meat has become a major concern in recent years. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  And in Wuhan, many of the first cases were either vendors who worked at the market or people who were shopped there. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=130.12s)]
*  By January 1st, Chinese authorities shut the place down. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=137.2s)]
*  Well, originally, Chinese authorities did feel that it possibly came from the Huanan market and from wild meat of some sort. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=141.0s)]
*  About three weeks later, scientists in Wuhan and Beijing published a pivotal paper in the medical journal The Lancet. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=150.28s)]
*  This chart shows how some of the early cases were people who hadn't been at the market. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=156.36s)]
*  More than a year later, there was new data to piece together a clearer picture. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=161.16s)]
*  That's because China allowed a group of international scientists to come to Wuhan for several weeks to visit the market and hospitals. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=165.76s)]
*  A team from the WHO that visited China also learned going through the data that by mid to late December, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=173.64s)]
*  the viruses that were infecting people were genetically different enough that they knew it wasn't all coming from the same place. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=181.2s)]
*  The WHO said the presence of early cases not linked to the market could suggest that it was not the original source of the outbreak. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=189.0s)]
*  And increasingly, one place the team visited is at the center of another hypothesis, the Wuhan Institute of Virology. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=195.8s)]
*  This is a world-class institute with high-security laboratories and does a lot of work with scientists outside of China. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=202.68s)]
*  Very vibrant collaboration before the pandemic. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=210.68s)]
*  They would travel to caves where bats are known to roost and take samples and then study them in their lab. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=214.64s)]
*  These bat coronaviruses and pathogens are cataloged in databases. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=221.11999999999998s)]
*  The researchers used this library of information to compare it to blood samples and oral swabs from patients in Wuhan. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=225.48s)]
*  And about a month after the market was closed, these researchers discovered that COVID-19 had a 96.2% genetic match with the bat coronavirus that the institute had found back in 2013. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=232.2s)]
*  Scientists around the world considered this a breakthrough in the search for COVID-19 source, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=244.64s)]
*  because it strongly indicated that it could have originated in bats. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  This laboratory studies bat coronaviruses right in Wuhan. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=253.68s)]
*  It was an obvious question, could it have escaped? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=257.52s)]
*  And even the institute's own researchers asked that question and went and did their own research. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=259.48s)]
*  As questions swirled around a possible accident at the institute, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  its top bat coronavirus experts said the virus didn't leak from her labs, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=268.76s)]
*  and none of its staff have tested positive for COVID-19. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=272.8s)]
*  These are not the first times that we've had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=276.08s)]
*  Last year, you know, what started out as a basic scientific question got politicized with a lot of finger pointing at China, yet there was no evidence presented. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  And there was also limited access to data during the WHO-led team's trip to Wuhan. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=295.56s)]
*  One of the stops was the Virology Institute. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=300.28s)]
*  They asked questions and they had a tour, but they didn't get any firsthand look at databases, medical records, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=302.68s)]
*  any sort of raw data which would have shed light on whether the virus could have escaped or not. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=309.96s)]
*  Almost a week later, scientists summed up their findings at a press conference. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=316.52s)]
*  They said the spillover from an intermediate host to humans was likely to very likely. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=320.4s)]
*  And as for questions surrounding the lab... [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  The findings suggest that the laboratory incident hypothesis is extremely unlikely. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=327.28s)]
*  But later, the WHO chief said the team didn't sufficiently examine the lab hypothesis and called for a fuller probe. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=336.96s)]
*  Three months later, after that press conference, a group of leading virologists and epidemiologists wrote a letter saying there were no findings in clear support of either a natural spillover or a lab accident. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=344.76s)]
*  This group of people is not saying that they believe it came from the lab. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=355.12s)]
*  What they're saying is that there's not enough evidence to rule it out. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=360.36s)]
*  Scientists investigate hypotheses and they rule them out one by one. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=364.44s)]
*  And they said that process hasn't been able to happen and it needs to happen. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  China says it's cooperated fully with the effort to search for COVID-19's source and has urged the WHO to investigate early cases in other countries. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=375.92s)]
*  And one place that could provide some new evidence for both hypotheses? Yunnan. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=385.44s)]
*  It's China's southwesternmost province and home to many coronavirus carrying bats and could set the stage for where the investigation into the origin of the virus could go next. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=391.56s)]
*  It's clearly an area where coronaviruses are circulating, including coronaviruses that are very closely related to SARS, the epidemic in 2003. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=400.64s)]
*  Researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology went to Yunnan to study large bat populations inside caves. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=412.84s)]
*  In these crowded spaces, viral strains can mix together and become the building blocks of coronavirus that then jump to humans. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=419.24s)]
*  And at the same time, there are wildlife farms there that supply animals to Wuhan. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  Scientists say this could explain how a virus from a bat cave leapt to an intermediate host that made its way to the market. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=431.84s)]
*  There was also a mine in Yunnan where scientists from the Institute spent some time from 2012 onwards. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=439.64000000000004s)]
*  It's where six miners who'd been clearing bat droppings had gotten sick and developed an unexplained pneumonia. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=445.20000000000005s)]
*  Three of them died. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=451.0s)]
*  So in 2013, scientists from the Institute went to the cave to collect samples from bats. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=453.6s)]
*  A virus from one of these samples turned out to be that 96.2% genetic match that was discovered by the Institute and hailed as a big break during the early days of the pandemic. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=458.96000000000004s)]
*  It took months for the Institute to reveal that the bat coronavirus samples were from the mine and that there were sick miners. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=468.8s)]
*  The failure to describe it more became kind of a touch point for people who wanted more information from the laboratory about the viruses they do have and what work they've been doing with them. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  Then there was another allegation about the Institute that surfaced more than a year later. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=489.2s)]
*  What U.S. intelligence officials learned is that there were three researchers who became ill enough to seek hospital care. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=494.64s)]
*  They had symptoms that were like COVID, but the symptoms like COVID are also like flu symptoms. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=503.56s)]
*  And flu was definitely circulating in Wuhan at that time. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=509.32s)]
*  Four days after the intelligence report about the sick lab workers, the Biden administration ordered a U.S. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=512.76s)]
*  intelligence inquiry into the two scenarios. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=518.4s)]
*  China said the report was untrue. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=521.2s)]
*  It's a scientific question, not a political tool. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=524.64s)]
*  Some people don't believe China and say this has to be a cover-up. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=528.0s)]
*  Others say we just need to verify. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=531.96s)]
*  That's what we do in science. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=535.28s)]
*  We verify. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=536.68s)]
*  We look at the data and reach our own conclusion. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=537.56s)]
*  It really does boil down to a question of transparency. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=540.6s)]
*  So for any progress to be made in the origins of the virus, it'll ultimately require more data and fuller access to where it was first detected in China. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=544.6s)]
*  The U.S. Department of State [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KQ75LM6Akg&t=554.64s)]
