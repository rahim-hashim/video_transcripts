**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0)
*  If you forgive the poor, tempted Irish, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=0.0s)]
*  Tamássá Wália, I'm at home. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=3.12s)]
*  President Biden clearly takes pride in his Irish heritage. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  As long as I can remember, it's been sort of part of my soul. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  He enjoys dropping old Irish sayings into conversation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=15.16s)]
*  If you're lucky enough to be Irish, well, you're lucky enough. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=17.6s)]
*  And when presented with a Mongolian horse named the animal Celtic. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=22.8s)]
*  Now, Biden has visited his ancestral home for the first time as president [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=26.96s)]
*  in what was both an important personal pilgrimage [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  and a demonstration of American soft power abroad. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  The second Catholic president's visit to Ireland came 60 years after the first, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=37.08s)]
*  John F. Kennedy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  I want to say that I'm happy to be here tonight. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=42.88s)]
*  And continued a long tradition of US leaders gracing the Emerald Isle. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=45.72s)]
*  I want you to know that for this great-grandson of Ireland, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=49.0s)]
*  this is a moment of joy. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  Many American presidents have described their days, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=54.199999999999996s)]
*  either visiting Belfast or Dublin, as some of the best days of their presidency. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=57.08s)]
*  Bill Clinton visited three times. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=61.48s)]
*  George W. Bush visited twice. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=63.28s)]
*  Barack Obama visited once. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=65.44s)]
*  And now Biden, who claims a lot of Irish ancestry. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=67.2s)]
*  During his trip, Biden visited the place his mother's family came from, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=71.08s)]
*  met the Irish president and addressed parliament in Dublin. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  The United States was shaped by Ireland, and that's not hyperbole. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=78.0s)]
*  The influence of Biden's Irish roots has long been seen in his political rhetoric. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=81.44000000000001s)]
*  His speeches, for example, often make references to Irish poetry. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  You know, it's the great Irish poet Seamus Haynes once wrote, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=88.84s)]
*  history says, don't hope on this side of the grave. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=91.72s)]
*  But then, once in a lifetime, the long-foretidal wave of justice rises up. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=95.84s)]
*  And hope and history rhyme. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=102.12s)]
*  It's everything I've been taught. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  I think for President Biden, the experience of being Irish [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=107.48s)]
*  and the historical experience of Irish living under British rule [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  is a way that he uses to sort of connect with oppressed minorities [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  in other parts of the world. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=120.28s)]
*  So he's made a real part of his political worldview. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=121.44s)]
*  My background and the background of my family is Irish American. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=124.56s)]
*  And we have a long history of... [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=130.0s)]
*  not fundamentally unlike the Palestinian people with Great Britain [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=138.08s)]
*  and their attitude towards Irish Catholics over the years. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=142.60000000000002s)]
*  Biden's Irish connection has helped strengthen already strong links [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  between the US and Ireland. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=149.52s)]
*  I think it's fair to say that today we're celebrating our National Day [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=151.4s)]
*  with a president who is unmistakably a son of Ireland. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=155.56s)]
*  Being a son of Ireland has also got him out of one or two verbal gaps in the past. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=160.96s)]
*  He knows a lot about it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  His mom lived in Long Island for ten years or so. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  God rest her soul. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=170.84s)]
*  Although, wait, your mom's still alive as your dad passed. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=173.56s)]
*  God bless her soul. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=178.32s)]
*  There's an old Irish proverb that some of you know [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=180.56s)]
*  that I heard my grandfather use, but never really applied to me before. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  He said, it goes, a silent mouth is sweet to hear. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=187.32s)]
*  Well, I'm going to yield to that proverb. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=193.48s)]
*  I think the Irish in general are very pro-American. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=196.12s)]
*  I mean, the connections are obviously huge [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=199.6s)]
*  because so many of its sons and daughters left [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=201.6s)]
*  and many of them went to America and made something of themselves. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=204.92s)]
*  So I think it's nice to have some of these people return, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=208.44s)]
*  create new links between Ireland and America. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=212.28s)]
*  This is particularly important now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=215.4s)]
*  25 years since the Good Friday Agreement was signed. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=217.2s)]
*  The landmark peace deal between Republicans and Unionists in Northern Ireland [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=220.68s)]
*  was negotiated with US help. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=224.28s)]
*  I think for America, it sort of brings a reminder of the times in the world [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=226.28s)]
*  when American hard power and soft power can sort of make a difference for good. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=230.76s)]
*  The president had the opportunity during his visit to push for its preservation [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=235.2s)]
*  amid political instability in the region. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=238.68s)]
*  As a friend, I hope it's not too presumptuous for me to say [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  that I believe democratic institutions established through the Good Friday Agreement [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=245.12s)]
*  remain critical to the future of Northern Ireland. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=249.8s)]
*  The Good Friday Agreement is an unquestioned win for peace. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=252.56s)]
*  And America was a big part of that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  So I think Biden's going to rightly sort of celebrate that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  Your history is our history. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=261.56s)]
*  But even more important, your future is America's future. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSDwMkJ5Z0&t=263.64s)]
