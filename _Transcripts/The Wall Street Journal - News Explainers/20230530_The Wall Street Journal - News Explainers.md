**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4)
*  In 2008, Samsung's smartphone manufacturing facilities were scattered throughout mainland [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=0.0s)]
*  China. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=6.92s)]
*  Just 15 years later, those factories have disappeared, and nearly all of them have relocated [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=8.16s)]
*  to Southeast Asia. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  It may have given Samsung a competitive advantage to go to Vietnam first. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  But Apple was on its heels. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=19.76s)]
*  Over the last few years, the tech giant started making similar moves to diversify its operations. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=21.82s)]
*  Here's a closer look at how Samsung and Apple's manufacturing moves from China are [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=27.52s)]
*  reshaping their businesses, and what the strategies reveal about the rapidly shifting global supply [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=32.56s)]
*  chain. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=37.92s)]
*  In 2008, Samsung set up a plant in the Bac Ninh region of Vietnam to reduce its dependence [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=38.92s)]
*  on China. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=45.72s)]
*  Tech industry analysts say it was a forward-thinking move for the South Korean company. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=46.72s)]
*  They benefit in a lot of ways. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  They benefit from cheaper labor in some of these countries that they're moving to. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  They benefit from being insulated from some of the geopolitical tensions that come with [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=56.48s)]
*  operating in China and continuing to expand in China. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=61.31999999999999s)]
*  They also benefit from being insulated from the kinds of supply chain shocks that we saw [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  during the COVID lockdowns in China and the supply chain disruptions that resulted from [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=67.92s)]
*  that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=73.4s)]
*  Over the next decade, rising labor and operating costs in China made it difficult for Samsung [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=74.4s)]
*  to produce its phones cheaply. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=79.56s)]
*  That, coupled with intensifying competition from domestic smartphone rivals, let Samsung's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=81.44s)]
*  market share in China to plummet. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, the company was slowly moving its smartphone operations out of the country. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=88.96s)]
*  Since 2013, the number of Samsung employees in China has fallen by 70%. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=93.92s)]
*  Samsung still kept significant manufacturing centers in China, including for its expansive [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=100.12s)]
*  memory chip business. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=105.6s)]
*  Samsung Semiconductor. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=107.32s)]
*  Moving its smartphone operations meant the company was shielded from many of the Trump-era [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=109.92s)]
*  tariffs on Chinese-made goods. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=115.16s)]
*  Those tariffs, coupled with the geopolitical tensions developing between the Western world [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=117.64s)]
*  and China, led a lot of companies to reconsider where they're manufacturing things. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=121.6s)]
*  By 2019, it had shut its last phone factory in the world's biggest smartphone market. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=126.64s)]
*  One year later, the pandemic hit, propelling tech companies like Apple to make similar [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=133.34s)]
*  moves away from China. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=137.94s)]
*  China had a very strict COVID policy that led to a lot of disruption for many of these [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=139.72s)]
*  companies and seriously pushed them to consider manufacturing elsewhere where that kind of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=145.76s)]
*  disruption would be less of a thorn in their sides. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=151.83999999999997s)]
*  Apple's plans gained even more momentum in late 2022, after violent protests rocked the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=155.44s)]
*  company's largest iPhone manufacturing plant in Zhengzhou, China. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=161.92s)]
*  Demonstrations erupted when the workers, who had been under strict COVID lockdown for [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=165.72s)]
*  weeks, learned bonus payments would be delayed. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=172.24s)]
*  At the time, Apple said it was working with the facility to ensure employee concerns were [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=175.4s)]
*  addressed. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=180.36s)]
*  According to analysts and people in the company's supply chain, Apple no longer feels comfortable [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=181.36s)]
*  having so much of its business tied up in one place. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=186.32s)]
*  While different events first propelled Samsung and Apple out of China, their new supply chain [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=189.72s)]
*  strategies focus on the same places, India and Vietnam. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=194.4s)]
*  These countries, some of them have offered tax breaks to companies to locate their manufacturing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  There have been in some cases grants and other incentives that are hard for these companies [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=204.32s)]
*  to pass up. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=209.5s)]
*  Samsung pays about 10% corporate income tax in Vietnam versus China's standard 25% rate. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=210.5s)]
*  It now produces half of its smartphones there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  Apple also has operations in Vietnam. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=219.6s)]
*  The company started producing its watches in the country and moved some iPad manufacturing [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=222.52s)]
*  there too. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  In Apple's most recent list of its top 200 suppliers, 25 were in Vietnam. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  That's 25% higher than four years ago. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=235.68s)]
*  Then there's India. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  Around 20 to 30% of all of Samsung's smartphones are now manufactured there, according to Morgan [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=241.24s)]
*  Stanley, and it's still expanding. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  In 2022, it opened the world's largest mobile phone factory near New Delhi. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=249.6s)]
*  These moves helped the company to become a dominant force in India's rapidly growing [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=254.98s)]
*  smartphone market, the second largest in the world behind China. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=259.24s)]
*  Awesome Galaxy A14 5G. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=262.96s)]
*  Now it just rupees 44 per day. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=265.24s)]
*  In 2022, Samsung accounted for around 20% of the country's total market share, while [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  Apple held less than 4%. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=273.26s)]
*  Apple is working to change that. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=275.88s)]
*  In a recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said, India is an incredibly exciting market. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=277.52s)]
*  It's a major focus for us. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=284.52s)]
*  So this year, Apple has said it plans to manufacture a portion of its iPhone 14 models in India [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=286.32s)]
*  for the first time, which is a significant move. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=294.28s)]
*  The company is essentially saying that we want to diversify. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=297.2s)]
*  Tuck analysts say manufacturing iPhones in India and then selling them to the surrounding [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  Southeast Asian market ensures a smooth and more resilient supply chain. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=306.2s)]
*  Apple's longer term goal is to ship 40 to 45% of iPhones from India, according to supply [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=311.44s)]
*  chain analysts. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  In 2022, that number was in the single digits for the company. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=319.2s)]
*  More recently, the company started moving manufacturing even closer to home. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=323.65999999999997s)]
*  A multi-billion dollar deal with US chip maker Broadcom will allow Apple to source critical [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=327.91999999999996s)]
*  chip components from manufacturing hubs around the US. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=333.08s)]
*  But even as Apple and Samsung spend billions to move away from China, the manufacturers [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  may still depend on suppliers there. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=342.28s)]
*  During the height of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak in China, Samsung found itself scrambling [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=344.84s)]
*  to secure suddenly scarce Chinese components. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=350.12s)]
*  There's also a political challenge because these companies, many of them still need to [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  manufacture in China to some extent, and they need to be delicate about how they handle [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=356.88s)]
*  diversifying their supply chains. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=361.24s)]
*  Even though a supply chain shift won't happen overnight, Samsung and Apple's manufacturing [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=363.08000000000004s)]
*  strategies reveal a larger de-risking trend that's transforming global markets. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=367.8s)]
*  It's kind of like diversifying a portfolio, if you will. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=372.8s)]
*  Increasingly, as the US and China, that relationship becomes more contentious. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=375.6s)]
*  A lot of Western companies see China as more risky, and so they're thinking about doing [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=379.68s)]
*  less in China. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=384.68s)]
*  They're thinking about de-risking from the perspective of the politics of the situation. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIH6kvYJwK4&t=385.68s)]
