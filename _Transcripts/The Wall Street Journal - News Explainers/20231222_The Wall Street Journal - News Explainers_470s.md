Video Description: AI tech is scanning the bodies, faces and even voices of some of Hollywood’s biggest actors to create digital doubles that can be transformed, de-aged, and even act in their stead. CAA, which represents actors like Tom Hanks and Zendaya, is embracing the tech that can clone their talent. 

WSJ takes an exclusive look at the technology behind one of the most controversial flashpoints in Hollywood, and why the industry’s top talent agency is going all in on AI.

# Inside the AI Tech Making Clones of Hollywood’s Biggest Actors  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck)
*  3, 2, 1. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=0.0s)]
*  This is one of the first steps in a trend that could upend the way movies are made. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=2.0s)]
*  Her purse was full of useless trash! [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=9.68s)]
*  AI gives Hollywood producers the ability to capture a scan of a star and use it to do, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  well, pretty much anything. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=19.68s)]
*  For example, neither of these guys is the real me. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=21.36s)]
*  But the technology used to do that comes with big risks, especially for actors. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=25.5s)]
*  So I visited the CAA Vault, a studio created by one of Hollywood's top talent agencies [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=31.54s)]
*  to give actors control of their digital doubles. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=38.66s)]
*  There's no way to imagine a future world without this. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=41.74s)]
*  I don't quite know what to anticipate here, but I'm excited to see what happens. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=46.06s)]
*  The CAA Vault houses four different stations that record an actor's body, face, movements, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=51.34s)]
*  and voice. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=57.34s)]
*  I feel like Jodie Foster in Contact. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=58.34s)]
*  They should have sent a poet. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=60.02s)]
*  Dominic Ridley, the director of VFX company Clear Angle Studios, works with CAA to create [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=61.42s)]
*  these digital scans. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=67.30000000000001s)]
*  With shooting those 17 different lighting fires, we get to see how the light is reacting [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=68.72s)]
*  to your materials and your skin, etc. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=73.10000000000001s)]
*  The first step in the process is a 3D full-body scan. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=74.94s)]
*  Why is this the pose? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=78.94s)]
*  So this is basically just allowing us to capture all the inside of your arm and hands [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=80.22s)]
*  while still being nice and relaxed. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=84.26s)]
*  It's hard not to be a little nervous. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=86.3s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=90.34s)]
*  One and a half seconds, that just is your full-body capture. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=91.34s)]
*  It's like a red carpet. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=93.34s)]
*  It shoots 17 different lighting environments in just 1.2 seconds. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=94.74s)]
*  Those few seconds capture more than 200 images that look like these. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=101.02s)]
*  Later, all of the images will be used in a process called photogrammetry, which brings [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=106.18s)]
*  together hundreds of 2D images in order to create a 3D image of my body. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=111.5s)]
*  The next step in the process is a range of motion scan. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=118.18s)]
*  Once you start feeling that kind of tension, don't go too far past that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=121.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=125.22s)]
*  It's like following a workout video. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=126.22s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=127.22s)]
*  It's just like following a workout video. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=128.22s)]
*  Is this for all the beach scenes you're filming me in? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=129.22s)]
*  As the technology has grown more popular in the industry, actors are worried about [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=133.3s)]
*  their digital doubles being used without their consent. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=137.78s)]
*  The use of AI doubles was a major sticking point in the recent union negotiations between [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=141.98000000000002s)]
*  actors and studios. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=147.46s)]
*  I'm AI! [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=149.06s)]
*  Bye bye! [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=150.06s)]
*  I'd imagine AI is a bigger and bigger part of your day. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=151.06s)]
*  Yeah, AI became something that we as a company were aware of a long time ago. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=155.9s)]
*  Brian Lord is CEO of the Creative Artists Agency, which represents actors like Tom Hanks, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  Cape Lanchet, and Zendaya, and is the company behind the CAA Vault. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=168.5s)]
*  What we believe is that an individual, whether you're famous or not, should own your digital [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=173.1s)]
*  presence. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=178.1s)]
*  And the simple concept of the Vault was to get out ahead of this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=179.1s)]
*  As the tech becomes more accessible, AI doubles could change the way actors work. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=183.56s)]
*  For example, they could avoid hours in their trailer thanks to digital makeup. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  Or they could use their double for reshoots while they move on to another project. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=191.94s)]
*  So far, there's been little protection around how these digital doubles are used. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=196.42s)]
*  There isn't any federal law protecting this kind of likeness, and local laws vary from [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=201.34s)]
*  state to state. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=206.24s)]
*  Many scans are owned by studios, not actors. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=207.74s)]
*  And payment is also an issue. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=211.54s)]
*  How much should an actor make when their double is used instead of them? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=213.7s)]
*  Outside of work, anyone can create their own scans to make deepfakes that do or say anything. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=217.98s)]
*  I'm going to show you some magic. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=224.38s)]
*  The agency says the CAA Vault is aimed at solving these issues, since all of the scans [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  taken at the Vault belong to the actors. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=232.22s)]
*  So that means, at the end of the day, my digital identity and all of the scans used to create [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=234.82s)]
*  it will belong to me. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=239.85999999999999s)]
*  That includes my next one, a face scan in a machine called Dorothy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=242.26s)]
*  She encapsulates the highest technology that we have at Clearing the Studios. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=247.18s)]
*  And in this system, we're going to capture your face in the highest detail, both for [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=250.22s)]
*  a 3D scan, we can do 4D scanning as well. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=254.46s)]
*  Do you feel like you're living in the future? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=257.18s)]
*  Um, no, my wife keeps me very grounded. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=259.1s)]
*  It captures the face in two sessions. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=263.3s)]
*  The first for use with photogrammetry, like in the full body scan. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=266.02s)]
*  What this does is it just allows very, very high qualities of alignment. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=270.26s)]
*  And when you're a 3D model, we can stabilize your 3D models around the cubes on your head. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=277.7s)]
*  Each three second capture grabs nearly 700 images. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=282.5s)]
*  This is followed by a series of 76 different facial expressions with just a single flash. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  That was the perfect algebra, which is this one. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=293.26s)]
*  The second stage is a capture for generative AI, which is a series of images used by a [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=296.94s)]
*  machine learning platform to recreate my image in 2D. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=302.46s)]
*  This includes the full spectrum of mouth movements, so my double can say any word and appear authentic. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=306.82s)]
*  To give the system enough options, I had to express a lot of emotions about a beige fox. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=313.62s)]
*  That quick beige fox jumped in the air over each thin dog. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=319.38s)]
*  The lights flash in very specific patterns in this scan to simulate different environments. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=324.28s)]
*  And then we can replicate the lighting from the set in here and then redo the performance. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=329.76s)]
*  Those scans come out looking something like this, allowing my double to be placed in different [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=335.08s)]
*  environments without the lighting looking unnatural. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=339.76s)]
*  These days, a chicken leg is a rare dish. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=344.0s)]
*  Then the last stage, a scan of my voice. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=347.23999999999995s)]
*  I could try to do like a British accent. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  The hogs were fed chopped corn and garbage. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=352.44s)]
*  So why do you have me saying these sentences? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=356.82s)]
*  Why do we care so much about women with trash in their purses and smoky flames? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=360.16s)]
*  These are words and phrases that will cover every possible sound to make other phrases [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=366.14s)]
*  or words happen, if that makes sense. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=372.78s)]
*  So from this collection of random sounds and sentences, you can have me say or do anything. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=374.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=380.44s)]
*  CAA then stores the scans and says they have a layer of security to protect the data. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=382.44s)]
*  Then I could hand off my digital mask to VFX studios like CAA vaults partner Deep Voodoo. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=388.92s)]
*  They can then make a digital rendering of, well, me. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=395.44s)]
*  While the tech is a major talking point in Hollywood right now, CAA says it's not just [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  actors being scanned. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=405.2s)]
*  Musicians, athletes, directors and content creators have also gone through the process. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=406.96s)]
*  But there's a lot of uncertainty about this technology. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=412.91999999999996s)]
*  For example, it's unclear how it could impact work in Hollywood for people who aren't major [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=416.06s)]
*  stars or what its implications might be in politics or our everyday lives. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=420.52s)]
*  I feel like that when you see this technology, the first response is, oh my God, this is [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=425.28s)]
*  so cool. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=430.28s)]
*  And the second response is, this could ruin the world. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=431.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=434.44s)]
*  Does it keep you up at night and do you worry about that as you try to, in some ways, advance [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=435.92s)]
*  this technology? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=440.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=441.52s)]
*  I mean, I think it was a big fundamental question that we had to ask ourselves is do we bury [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=442.52s)]
*  our heads in the sand or do we embrace this and go after it? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=447.96s)]
*  And so we think we all have a responsibility to embrace it, but to embrace it with some [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=452.56s)]
*  sort of ethics and morals and fairness in mind. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU9o1GC48ck&t=458.54s)]
