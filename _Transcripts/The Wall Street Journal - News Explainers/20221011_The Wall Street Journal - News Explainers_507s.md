# Las Vegas: A Water Conservation Trailblazer Amid the Worst Drought in 1,200 Years | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08)
*  Shrinking reservoirs, depleted aquifers, drying rivers. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=0.0s)]
*  These images reveal the scale of the mega drought sweeping the American West. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=4.8s)]
*  It's the worst drought the region has seen in at least 1200 years. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=9.92s)]
*  With more pressure on water supplies, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=14.08s)]
*  one desert city offers a promising conservation model. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=16.16s)]
*  You fly into Vegas, you see the Bellagio Fountains, and you see the golf courses, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  and it looks like a land of absolute waste. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=25.6s)]
*  I've discovered that actually Southern Nevada is one of the most water-minded places on Earth. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=28.72s)]
*  Since 2002, Southern Nevada has cut its Colorado River water use by 26 percent, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=34.8s)]
*  while also adding 750,000 people to its population. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=40.8s)]
*  Still, severe drought conditions are forcing the region to find even more ways to reduce its [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=45.44s)]
*  consumption. With the Colorado River basin at a dangerous tipping point, here's how Las Vegas [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=51.04s)]
*  offers a roadmap to making the most out of every drop of water. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=56.88s)]
*  In June, the federal government ordered unprecedented water cutbacks, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  asking western states to reduce their water use by as much as 30 percent to save the Colorado River [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  system. The Colorado River really is the lifeblood of the American Southwest. It runs for over 1400 [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=73.28s)]
*  miles, and along the way it provides water for 40 million people. As one of the thirstiest cities [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=79.36s)]
*  in the nation's driest state, Las Vegas leaders realized they couldn't afford to gamble on water. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=85.84s)]
*  On average, Nevada receives less than 10 inches of rainfall a year. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=91.68s)]
*  It also gets the smallest amount of water from the Colorado River. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=96.0s)]
*  The Colorado River was divided up about 100 years ago under the 1922 Colorado River Compact, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=99.92s)]
*  where you had seven states that were all negotiating for how much water each state [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=106.48s)]
*  would be allocated from the river system. At that time, with the population that we had, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=112.24s)]
*  with the lack of potential for agriculture here in our community, it sort of made sense that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=118.16s)]
*  perhaps Nevada did only get a small amount. Decades later, scientists discovered the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  Compact severely overestimated how much water flows down the Colorado River each year. This [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=128.64s)]
*  overallocation of water, combined with warming temperatures and record-breaking drought, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=134.64s)]
*  has the river system on the verge of collapse. At the same time, the constant pressure on Las [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=139.28s)]
*  Vegas' water supply has helped transform the region into a leader in conservation. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  The Bellagio Water Fountain on the Las Vegas Strip is one of the city's most iconic and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=152.24s)]
*  noticeable symbols of excess water use. The 8.5-acre man-made lake holds more than 22 million [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=157.6s)]
*  gallons of water, but nearly all of it is recycled. The thing that most people don't know is that the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=165.04s)]
*  Bellagio Fountain doesn't use any of our community's water supply. There is no Colorado River water that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=170.16s)]
*  is used for that fountain. It is fed by a private well that pulls groundwater and is owned by the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=175.84s)]
*  hotel. Still, the recycling system isn't perfect. The fountain could lose millions of gallons annually [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=182.88s)]
*  to evaporation. An MGM Resort spokesperson said they were committed to using water responsibly [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=189.28s)]
*  across the company and supply chain. The Las Vegas Strip obviously is the backbone of our community, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=195.28s)]
*  but what's really interesting is that it only uses about five percent of our community's total water [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=201.84s)]
*  supply. Residents who live here use 60 percent of our community's total water supply. So I don't [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=207.44s)]
*  know any other community that makes a very small investment of its water supply to get such great [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=214.0s)]
*  economic returns. The Bellagio Fountain represents just a fraction of the region's water recycling [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=220.0s)]
*  efforts. Nearly every drop of water used indoors throughout southern Nevada is treated, recycled, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=225.76s)]
*  and returned in near-drinkable quality to Lake Mead, according to the Clark County Water Reclamation [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=231.84s)]
*  District. In 2021, this accounted for about 50 percent of the region's total water consumption. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=238.96s)]
*  So the amount of water that the Las Vegas Valley recycles is absolutely unprecedented in the Western [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=244.48s)]
*  United States. Dan Fisher works at the largest water recycling plant on the Colorado River Basin. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=250.16s)]
*  For every gallon of water that we return, we can take another gallon of water out. Without our [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=256.56s)]
*  ability to recycle our water and safely return it to the lake and reuse it because we treat it so [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=261.04s)]
*  effectively, without those things Las Vegas wouldn't be what it is. To keep up with rapid [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=267.2s)]
*  population growth, the region's water recycling facilities are nearly always under construction. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  The wastewater treatment plants cannot get behind. That is just not an option. We have to stay ahead [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=278.4s)]
*  of it. We have to keep building more and more facilities in order to be able to take that water [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  and effectively treat it. Another way Las Vegas is able to cut back on its water is by removing [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=289.44s)]
*  one of its biggest water guzzlers, grass. When you consider that grass consumes 73 gallons per [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=296.4s)]
*  square foot to survive in the Mojave Desert, you know that's a column of water that is 10 feet tall [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  for every square foot of grass. In 1999, the Southern Nevada Water Authority started its [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=309.91999999999996s)]
*  Cash for Grass program, which currently pays homeowners three dollars for each square foot [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=316.23999999999995s)]
*  of grass that's replaced with water-efficient desert landscaping. The region has removed [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=321.28s)]
*  about 207 million square feet of grass as a result of this policy. No place really in the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  American West has been better than Las Vegas at getting rid of grass. It's spread to the rest of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  the West. Phoenix is doing this. Los Angeles now has kind of a war on grass, but Las Vegas really [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=337.84s)]
*  is the pioneer. More recently, a new law in Southern Nevada, the first of its kind in the nation, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=343.2s)]
*  bans non-functional grass. That's the grass in medians and roadways that is only planted [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=348.56s)]
*  for decorative purposes. Ecologists say grasslands can also be bad for desert ecosystems, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  not meant to sustain water-intensive plants. As of today, there are approximately 3,000 acres [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  of non-functional grass. Replacing that grass will save about 10 percent of our community's overall [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=366.56s)]
*  water supply. Rigorous conservation efforts don't just outlaw grass, but also dictate when residents [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=372.48s)]
*  can water their yards or wash their cars. Water investigators like this one patrol neighborhoods [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=380.0s)]
*  to cite people who violate rules. We leave a courtesy door hanger with a watering guide letting [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=386.64000000000004s)]
*  them know, hey you're not allowed a lot of water today. I think it's important to note that Southern [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=393.44s)]
*  Nevada did not place conservation on one sector. We did not just require it of the resorts down on [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=398.32s)]
*  the Las Vegas Strip. We did not just require it of residents. We placed conservation on the backs of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=404.32s)]
*  every single sector in our community. As the drought across the American West worsens, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=410.0s)]
*  reservoirs across the region are reaching critical levels. This summer, the country's largest [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=416.08s)]
*  reservoir, Lake Mead, fell to a record low. You see the pictures of Lake Mead. You see the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=421.28s)]
*  200 feet of air where there used to be water for over the entire lake. Unless the drought subsides, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=426.96s)]
*  we could get to a point where Lake Mead cannot deliver any water out of Hoover Dam. That's a [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=432.96s)]
*  real possibility and that's a terrifying thought. The federal government says the seven Colorado [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=438.08s)]
*  River basin states still need to make more water cutbacks. And the feds basically said, if you don't [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=445.28s)]
*  do it voluntarily, we reserve the right to make you. We'll decide for you. All the basin states [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=451.76s)]
*  said they recognized their shared role and bring the river system into balance. More recently, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=458.8s)]
*  California, the region's largest water user, promised to reduce the state's use of Colorado [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=464.08s)]
*  River water by 400,000 acre feet every year for the next three years. Even as a leader in water [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=469.68s)]
*  conservation, the Southern Nevada Water Authority says Las Vegas is finding more ways to cut back. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=476.64s)]
*  It takes all sectors of your community in order to contribute to water conservation and be [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=483.12s)]
*  successful. And it's going to be the same thing on the Colorado River. It is going to take every [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=488.96s)]
*  water user across every sector to be contributing to the efforts to reduce those water demands [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  so that we can bring this system back into balance. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=500.08s)]
*  you [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gE6gYC_I08&t=506.64s)]
