# Tesla Quality Issues Threaten Its Dominance in China EV Market  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 24, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4)
*  If you were on Chinese social media at the start of the year, you might have come across [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=0.0s)]
*  this video. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=5.2s)]
*  It appears to show a Tesla Model 3 in flames at a Shanghai parking garage. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=6.68s)]
*  The reports were widely watched and shared on popular microblogging site Weibo and messaging [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  app WeChat. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=22.48s)]
*  In a statement to Chinese media, Tesla said that nobody was injured and the fire was likely [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=23.98s)]
*  caused by something hitting the bottom of the car and damaging the battery before it [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=28.9s)]
*  caught fire. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=32.98s)]
*  Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the video in question. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=33.98s)]
*  Other videos appearing to show quality issues in vehicles sold by the EV maker have surfaced [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=38.1s)]
*  on Chinese social media. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=42.66s)]
*  And after a number of customer complaints, Tesla was summoned by Chinese regulators over [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=44.58s)]
*  safety concerns, casting a shadow over Tesla's success story in a country where the Model [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=49.099999999999994s)]
*  3 sedan quickly became the best-selling electric vehicle. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=54.58s)]
*  Tesla has been enjoying a honeymoon in China, was viewed with adoring eyes. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=58.02s)]
*  People think Tesla is associated with high tech. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=64.3s)]
*  But now with this accumulation of complaints, it's going to be quite a major issue. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=67.82000000000001s)]
*  Quality issues aren't new for Tesla. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  Manufacturing problems have prompted recalls and investigations in the U.S. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=76.58s)]
*  In the past, Tesla has said it swiftly addressed complaints from customers. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=81.14s)]
*  But in the world's largest electric vehicle market, these quality issues could threaten [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=85.6s)]
*  Tesla's meteoric rise. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=89.88s)]
*  Tesla has pulled off some major feats in the last couple years. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=94.28s)]
*  Globally, its car deliveries and market valuation have grown quickly. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=97.44s)]
*  Tesla first entered the Chinese auto market in 2013 when it opened a showroom in Beijing [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=102.08s)]
*  and started taking online pre-orders for its Model S. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  We're incredibly excited to break ground on the Shanghai J-Factory. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=110.24s)]
*  In 2019, Tesla became the first foreign carmaker in the country to run its own plant without [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=115.24s)]
*  partnering with a Chinese company, something local officials typically require from foreign [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  companies that want to operate in the country. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  We want to very much say thank you and appreciation for the Shanghai government and the support. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  Yunxi Wang is the director of a group at UC Davis studying China's transportation energy [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=132.2s)]
*  sector. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=137.44s)]
*  When Tesla entered China, U.S. China, they were really in the middle of a trade war. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=138.44s)]
*  So there was a huge incentive to showcase that China is opening to the world, is not [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=143.56s)]
*  discriminating against foreign investment. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=149.8s)]
*  It took Tesla less than a year to get its Shanghai plant up and running. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=153.48s)]
*  That's half the time it took to launch its battery-producing gigafactory near Reno, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=157.44s)]
*  Nevada. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=161.6s)]
*  After getting funding from Chinese banks and quick approval from officials, Tesla was delivering [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=162.6s)]
*  its first Chinese-made cars to local drivers by early 2020. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=167.16s)]
*  And in early 2021, Tesla started delivering its Model Y cars. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=174.44s)]
*  Car sales in China brought in more than $6.6 billion in revenue for Tesla in 2020 and helped [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=179.56s)]
*  the carmaker reach a record 500,000 global vehicle deliveries that year. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=185.56s)]
*  But then in early 2021, Chinese regulators reported an unusual uptick of customer complaints [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  about Tesla quality issues. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=198.08s)]
*  In this online video, for example, a Tesla driver appears to complain about the car accelerating [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=200.88s)]
*  without the driver's foot on the pedal, with cruise control and autopilot functions appearing [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=205.72s)]
*  to be turned off. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=210.48s)]
*  Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on this video. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=212.32s)]
*  Authorities say they held talks with Tesla on the consumer-reported abnormal acceleration [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=223.76s)]
*  and battery fires. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=228.56s)]
*  Regarding the carmaker, that it needs to abide by Chinese laws and strengthen internal management [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=230.36s)]
*  to ensure the quality and safety of its products. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  It couldn't be determined whether the cars in the videos circulating in China were made [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=238.12s)]
*  in Shanghai. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=241.68s)]
*  The company said it would investigate the claims and abide by the law. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=243.12s)]
*  It didn't respond to our request for comment. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=246.88000000000002s)]
*  Industry observers questioned whether the speed at which Tesla scaled up production [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=250.32000000000002s)]
*  in China could have affected the quality of its cars. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  Tesla was meeting a huge demand in China. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=257.6s)]
*  There was also some rush that might contribute to the quality and may now be able to provide [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=260.48s)]
*  quality products in time to meet their demand. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=267.04s)]
*  Tesla didn't respond to our questions on whether production speed may have affected [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=270.68s)]
*  quality in China. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  But Elon Musk has acknowledged in a recent interview that the company has faced production [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=275.92s)]
*  challenges. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=280.56s)]
*  During that production ramp, it's super hard to be in vertical climb mode and get [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=281.8s)]
*  everything right. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=287.48s)]
*  Industry analysts said Tesla's response to regulatory scrutiny in China differed [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=288.48s)]
*  sharply from the tone it is usually employed with regulators in the U.S. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=292.76s)]
*  In 2018, Musk sparred with U.S. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=296.76s)]
*  regulators as they investigated his tweets about taking Tesla private when his company [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=299.04s)]
*  was in a cash crunch. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=303.68s)]
*  Tesla never ended up going private. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=305.92s)]
*  And in 2020, Musk initially defied a California county government order to suspend production [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=307.88s)]
*  due to coronavirus. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=313.08000000000004s)]
*  And at one point, he tweeted, the coronavirus panic is dumb. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=315.04s)]
*  Tesla's issues in China right now aren't necessarily unique. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=319.12s)]
*  Other EV makers, including its rival NIO, have also reported battery fires. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=322.70000000000005s)]
*  But transportation analysts say Tesla needs to protect its reputation in a market that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=327.68s)]
*  already represents 20 percent of its revenue and is expected to grow. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  I think that it has to be more careful than Chinese local companies. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=336.08s)]
*  And they're bigger and they're perceived to be a better company. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=348.68s)]
*  Tesla's been allowed to operate with relative freedom thanks to a loosening of China's [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=352.47999999999996s)]
*  rules for foreign automakers in 2018. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=356.32s)]
*  For instance, many foreign car makers like GM and Mercedes were required to partner with [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=359.47999999999996s)]
*  local companies. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=364.18s)]
*  But the Silicon Valley company faces increased competition from local startups, including [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=366.04s)]
*  Li Auto and Xpeng. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=370.48s)]
*  As it hopes to continue to gain ground in China, pressure from regulators comes at a [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=372.8s)]
*  critical time for Tesla. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwd6_Ty-rE4&t=376.96000000000004s)]
