# Super Bowl 2023 Ads Budweiser Will See Its First Competition in 33 Years  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E)
*  Perhaps the only thing more anticipated on Super Bowl Sunday than the game itself [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=0.0s)]
*  Puppymunky baby [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  He's got smart pegs [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=7.68s)]
*  I'm on a horse [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=9.36s)]
*  are the commercials [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=10.24s)]
*  You can't just wear my face [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=11.6s)]
*  And many of the most iconic commercials are beer ads from the funny [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=12.88s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=19.12s)]
*  What's that? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=19.68s)]
*  What's that? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=20.88s)]
*  Yeah [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  To the poignant [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=23.04s)]
*  But for 33 years, these beer ads have had one thing in common [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=24.64s)]
*  When you say but you say it all [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=28.4s)]
*  Anheuser-Busch InBev has been the only company permitted to advertise alcohol during the Super [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=31.44s)]
*  Bowl thanks to an exclusivity deal with the NFL. Budweiser took full advantage of that agreement [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=36.8s)]
*  and for the past two decades the brewer outspent all other brands in advertising at the Super Bowl. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=42.64s)]
*  But this year Budweiser is calling an audible and giving up its grip on the event [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=48.48s)]
*  and that has opened the door to beer and alcohol companies that have long been excluded from the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=53.52s)]
*  big game. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=58.16s)]
*  Anheuser-Busch giving up their exclusivity on that game is a huge deal. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=59.2s)]
*  Super Bowls are consistently ranked as the most watched annual television broadcasts in America [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=65.6s)]
*  although ratings have declined in recent years. Last year the big game was ranked the most [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=71.28s)]
*  The big game attracted over 112 million viewers. According to the analytics firm Kantar there are [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=75.84s)]
*  approximately 80 to 100 ads aired during each Super Bowl. That works out to a total advertising [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=84.16000000000001s)]
*  time of about 50 minutes or roughly 30 seconds per ad. Purchasing a commercial during the big game [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  isn't cheap. In 2022 each 30 second ad slot went for as much as 6.5 million dollars. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  I got some bad news. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  So after previously paying for the privilege to keep its competitors off the field, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=105.44s)]
*  why is Budweiser changing course? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=110.08s)]
*  Even though Anheuser-Busch gave up their exclusive right to be the only alcohol [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  advertiser in the Super Bowl doesn't mean that Super Bowl is not impactful from a business [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=119.44s)]
*  point of view. Anheuser-Busch is still spending tons of money during the game on ads and what [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=124.16s)]
*  they've said publicly is that they're basically going to use some of the money that they used on [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=129.44s)]
*  that for other things. So when you think about Super Bowl it happens in the middle of February. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=133.36s)]
*  It's not really the prime selling season for beer. That happens in summer. So you could imagine that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=138.4s)]
*  a company like AB might save some of that money and spend it when you know sales are really high. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  Although Anheuser-Busch InBev has effectively had a monopoly on Super Bowl beer ads since 1989, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  other brands have found creative ways into the conversation surrounding the game, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=154.24s)]
*  such as buying ad time in local markets around the country. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=158.4s)]
*  Beer brands have really had to bend over backwards to try and steal the buzz and they've [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=161.52s)]
*  for years depended on these guerrilla marketing campaigns to stimulate Super Bowl buzz without [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=166.88000000000002s)]
*  actually buying ads and it's a fraction of the price and you're still getting press and you're [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  also seeing you know seen in really big markets. This is a stunt designed to make you miss our [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=176.8s)]
*  competitors at... One of the really successful guerrilla marketing campaigns that a rival brewer [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=181.12s)]
*  had run a couple years ago was won by Miller Lite. They basically ran a contest where they [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=186.08s)]
*  offered free beer for consumers basically saying when they see an ultra the Michelope Ultra ad [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=191.12s)]
*  to go to the web and type in this extra long URL. So basically that's stealing the traffic that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=196.96s)]
*  other people would have been searching for that brand and it got them a lot of publicity leading [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  up to the game even though they didn't have a Super Bowl ad in the game itself. For this year's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=206.4s)]
*  Super Bowl, viewers can expect to see spirit brands like Remy Martin and Crown Royal Whiskey. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=210.56s)]
*  Peanut butter? What? Crown Royal is seizing on the opportunity to compete. Dave Grohl of the Food [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=216.08s)]
*  Fighters is already being featured in a teaser designed to elicit interest in the big game's ad [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  spot. The egg carton? So I think the biggest beneficiary of Anheuser-Busch's change will be [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  Molson Coors. The company actually is really creative because they've learned to sort of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=233.36s)]
*  try and find their way to steal the buzz and this year they've used that creativity to come out with [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  this huge program. After an over 30 year hiatus, Molson Coors recently ran ads asking consumers [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=244.16s)]
*  which of its two light beers, Miller Lite or Coors Lite, deserves the brewer's coveted Super Bowl spot. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=251.6s)]
*  They've teamed up with Draft Kings which is really smart given how you know everybody in this nation [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=257.28s)]
*  is obsessed with sports online betting right now. So what consumers can do is go and figure out like [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  oh I think this is what they're you know will it be will it be Miller will it be Coors. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=268.4s)]
*  Heineken will also make an appearance this year. The Dutch brand is teaming up with Marvel to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  promote the upcoming Ant-Man film and its alcohol-free brew Heineken 0.0. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=280.23999999999995s)]
*  Despite giving up its exclusivity agreement with the NFL, Anheuser-Busch in-bev brands like Bud [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  Lite and Michelob Ultra will still have a presence in the game on February 12th. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  Who drinks Budweiser? But on the national stage Budweiser won't be appearing. They say all people [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=298.64s)]
*  are six degrees of separation away from each other. In regional markets Budweiser will run an ad that [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  features a Kevin Bacon voiceover with a nod to the concept of six degrees of separation, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=311.2s)]
*  all facilitated by a six-pack. The people who share the same spirit share the same beer. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=316.47999999999996s)]
*  This Buds for you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCCT9GR44E&t=323.84s)]
