# Wirecard and the Curious Case of the Missing $2 Billion | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 26, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg)
*  Wirecard, an online payment company that was once the darling of Germany's fintech industry, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=0.0s)]
*  lost nearly $12bn of market value and filed for insolvency just days after revealing a [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=6.68s)]
*  $2bn hole in its balance sheet. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=13.24s)]
*  What's happening at Wirecard looks like being one of the worst financial disasters in Europe [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=16.8s)]
*  since the financial crisis. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=21.28s)]
*  I mean you have to stretch back a long period of time to have an implosion of this magnitude [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=22.28s)]
*  in Europe. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=27.68s)]
*  Revealing Wirecard money was supposed to be held in two trust accounts, but auditors investigating [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=28.68s)]
*  the company said they couldn't find it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=33.84s)]
*  This $2bn is essentially equivalent to all the profits that Wirecard has made in more [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=36.8s)]
*  than a decade. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=44.04s)]
*  And everyone is wondering, where did that money go? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=45.72s)]
*  And nobody knows at the moment whether it ever existed or not. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=48.72s)]
*  Here's what we know. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=54.36s)]
*  Let's rewind and start with what Wirecard actually does. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=56.36s)]
*  We are a global fintech company with 20 years of payment experience. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=59.84s)]
*  The German company provides software and systems that link retailers, consumers and the financial [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=63.76s)]
*  system. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  So essentially what they do is they collect sort of payment details from people who want [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=70.08s)]
*  to buy stuff online or even in stores. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=74.8s)]
*  They collect those details from their cards and then they perform the role of confirming, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=78.12s)]
*  settling, processing that whole transaction when you buy anything online, whether it be [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=84.56s)]
*  a holiday, some goods or services. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  Their background was a lot of it was in gambling and pornography or adult entertainment. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=92.2s)]
*  Over the years the company began to bloom as commerce shifted online and away from cash [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=96.92s)]
*  payments. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  It attracted interest from giants like Softbank and Credit Suisse. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=103.56s)]
*  Their stock grew almost sixfold between 2016 and 2018. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=107.56s)]
*  But some have questioned Wirecard's business model and whether the company was actually [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=112.0s)]
*  worth its market valuation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=116.24s)]
*  I think it was around October 2015 when I used to write a blog actually and one of the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=118.44s)]
*  readers of the blog contacted me and said have you ever looked at this company called [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=125.44s)]
*  Wirecard? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=130.12s)]
*  And I hadn't. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=131.12s)]
*  I've never heard of Wirecard to be honest. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=132.12s)]
*  That's Matt Earl. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=134.2s)]
*  He's a short seller meaning he tries to make money by betting that a certain company's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=135.2s)]
*  share price will fall. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=138.72s)]
*  In 2016 Earl published a report accusing Wirecard of malpractice. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=140.76s)]
*  The main accusation was that they had probably been instrumental and involved in this processing [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=145.32s)]
*  illegal gambling, US facing illegal online gambling monies. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  The company denied those allegations and Earl says he stopped short selling its stock some [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  years ago. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=164.92s)]
*  A new wave of Financial Times articles on the company's global operations led to Wirecard [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=167.52s)]
*  calling in KPMG for a special audit. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=172.88000000000002s)]
*  This audit was supposed to demonstrate that a bunch of the business that people had said [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  they doubted was really real. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=181.88s)]
*  But KPMG said it wasn't able to determine the answer to some of those questions. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=184.4s)]
*  And one of the biggest questions was why there was a bunch of money supposedly in some trustee [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=189.44s)]
*  accounts and whether that money was really there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=195.68s)]
*  When auditors went looking for the $2 billion of cash that Wirecard had said was in two [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=199.48s)]
*  trust accounts in the Philippines, what they found was a gaping hole. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  Electronic scans of documents confirming the accounts had been sent to Ernst & Young, but [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=208.84s)]
*  its main auditor, Ernst & Young, finally said that these documents weren't reliable and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  that they thought they'd been deceived. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=220.84s)]
*  The Wirecard story then began to unravel quite rapidly. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=222.8s)]
*  CEO Marcus Braun stepped down, Wirecard said that the missing $2 billion probably didn't exist, and then... [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=226.4s)]
*  What he stands accused of is inflating the value of the company through feigning business [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=242.44s)]
*  with these third-party acquirers. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=249.88000000000002s)]
*  Braun has consistently denied wrongdoing and his lawyers didn't respond to a request for comment. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=252.28s)]
*  The partner companies in question were supposed to process payments for Wirecard in countries [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=257.88s)]
*  where it didn't have full licences to operate. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=262.16s)]
*  But it couldn't be determined whether they generated any revenue for the company at all. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=265.32s)]
*  In a matter of days, the company had filed for insolvency proceedings, citing over-indebtedness. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=270.52s)]
*  Matt Earl, the short seller, says even if he's not making money from Wirecard's latest woes, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=276.4s)]
*  he's glad that people are starting to see the clearer picture. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=282.16s)]
*  Obviously the more cases that you begin to put into the puzzle, the clearer the picture becomes. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=284.6s)]
*  But there's still a big question over whether or not that $2 billion actually exists. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=291.44s)]
*  Wirecard executives have advanced two theories. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=297.32000000000005s)]
*  One is that the numbers were completely made up, the revenue was never there, and that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=301.16s)]
*  Wirecard was simply trying to inflate the value of its business in order to make its shares more attractive, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=307.92s)]
*  in order to borrow more money. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=314.52000000000004s)]
*  And the other option is that some of this business did exist, but for whatever reason, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=316.92s)]
*  it wasn't really being done on behalf of Wirecard and the money was never put where it was supposed to be put. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=323.8s)]
*  And in fact, it has been, you know, in all or in part taken by some other people somewhere. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdYpXuwGVFg&t=330.72s)]
