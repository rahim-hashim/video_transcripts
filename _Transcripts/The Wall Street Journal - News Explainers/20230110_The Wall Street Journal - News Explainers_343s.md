# A White-Collar Recession? Why Layoffs Are Hitting Professional Workers  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE)
*  Amazon, Ford, Pepsi, and more from Amazon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=0.0s)]
*  These are just a few of the companies [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=6.32s)]
*  that have said they were starting big layoffs [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=7.98s)]
*  in the last year. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=9.94s)]
*  Some job cuts are expected [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=11.3s)]
*  when the economy hits a rough patch. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=12.86s)]
*  But this is different, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=14.94s)]
*  not because of the number of people being laid off, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=16.66s)]
*  but because of who. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  We're seeing a really unusual situation [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=20.98s)]
*  where white collar workers, professionals, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=23.16s)]
*  are being laid off in greater numbers [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=25.46s)]
*  relative to the rest of the workforce. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=27.46s)]
*  Here's why white collar jobs are getting cut first [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=29.68s)]
*  and why that's a departure from slowdowns in the past. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=32.28s)]
*  Ever since this wave of job cuts started last year, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  experts have said that this downturn [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=40.8s)]
*  could spell trouble for professional workers. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=42.44s)]
*  This recession is gonna be really bad [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=44.8s)]
*  not only for white collar workers, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=47.64s)]
*  but white Patagonia-vested workers. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=49.16s)]
*  But to understand why those cuts are happening, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=53.0s)]
*  we have to go back even further [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=55.44s)]
*  to the beginning of the pandemic. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=57.36s)]
*  As the economy went into crisis mode, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=59.12s)]
*  layoffs hit a lot of industries. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=61.26s)]
*  But ones that are not predominantly white collar [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=64.02s)]
*  were some of the most affected. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=66.42s)]
*  Entertainment and leisure and retail, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=68.46s)]
*  which hire a lot of low-wage and frontline staff, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=70.78s)]
*  made up most of the job cuts [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=73.7s)]
*  in the first seven months of 2020. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=75.14s)]
*  In-person workplaces, everybody got sent home. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=77.66s)]
*  And so you had a lot of white collar workers [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=80.53999999999999s)]
*  who could do the kinds of jobs [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=83.22s)]
*  that companies still needed in great quantity. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=84.9s)]
*  And companies like Zoom, boom. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=87.18s)]
*  Companies like Google and Microsoft, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=88.9s)]
*  suddenly their products were in much greater demand. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=91.04s)]
*  As the economy started to recover, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  some industries saw the average number of employees grow [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=95.72s)]
*  from pre-pandemic levels, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=98.72s)]
*  while others, especially those with frontline workers, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=100.44000000000001s)]
*  grew only a little bit or were left at a deficit. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=103.56s)]
*  But as employers are now making job cuts [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=107.2s)]
*  amid rising interest rates, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=109.68s)]
*  they're facing two major problems. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=111.84s)]
*  For some, it's an excess of white collar workers [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=114.2s)]
*  who may have been hired for special projects [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=116.56s)]
*  or company expansions during the pandemic. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=118.9s)]
*  Some of those projects have been closed [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=121.36s)]
*  or pulled back or narrowed. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=123.36s)]
*  And so companies that hired a lot during the pandemic [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=125.12s)]
*  are just finding they don't need as many people. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=128.8s)]
*  But elsewhere, there's an unmet demand for workers, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=131.48s)]
*  namely in blue collar, low-wage and frontline jobs. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=134.66s)]
*  It feels like we have a structural labor shortage out there [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=138.38s)]
*  where there are four million fewer people, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=141.4s)]
*  a little more than four million, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=143.68s)]
*  who are in the workforce available to work [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=145.16s)]
*  than there's demand for workforce. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=147.2s)]
*  The Fed says the shortage has multiple causes. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=148.84s)]
*  Some of it is due to more people going into retirement, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=151.68s)]
*  but other factors like slowing immigration [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=154.72s)]
*  are also playing a role. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=157.16s)]
*  Some economists also say that mindsets about work [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=159.2s)]
*  have shifted amid COVID-19 for these workers. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=162.4s)]
*  If we look back at that change in employees on payroll, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=166.68s)]
*  some of the industries that have had a harder time recovering [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  are ones that a lot of workers didn't return to. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=172.28s)]
*  And companies don't want to risk being unable [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=174.92s)]
*  to fill important jobs as the economy speeds up again. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  So they're being careful about keeping those workers. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=180.92s)]
*  Some people call it labor hoarding. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  They're actually holding on to these people, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  trying to keep them from leaving, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=187.44s)]
*  even if they don't need them all right now. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=188.72s)]
*  As hiring has started to slow, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  ads for jobs in white collar industries [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  have fallen the most. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  And as for layoffs... [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  White collar workers are there. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=198.92s)]
*  They're paid more, so job cuts can save you more money [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=200.39999999999998s)]
*  with fewer people. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  And you don't risk giving up those hard to find [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  frontline workers that you're gonna need [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  when the economy improves. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=211.3s)]
*  But this breaks from the norm of what has happened [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=213.22000000000003s)]
*  in many other economic slowdowns. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=215.5s)]
*  Usually... [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=217.94s)]
*  First, capital-intensive industries lay people off, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=218.94s)]
*  factories and construction companies. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=221.3s)]
*  Then you see companies with large low-wage workforces, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=223.62s)]
*  retailers, hospitality companies, restaurants and hotels. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=226.38000000000002s)]
*  And only later as the economy really starts to slow [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=230.22000000000003s)]
*  and as a recession looms or kicks in, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=233.86s)]
*  are professional workers and white collar workers [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=236.70000000000002s)]
*  usually laid off. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=239.22s)]
*  Just look at the recession in the early 1980s, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=240.5s)]
*  where blue collar workers made up 75% of layoffs. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  It's few and far between jobs are hard to come by. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=246.94s)]
*  How about you? You hiring? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=249.06s)]
*  And even more recently, in 2007, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=250.26000000000002s)]
*  just before the start of the Great Recession, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=252.9s)]
*  blue collar industries like construction and manufacturing [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=255.26000000000002s)]
*  were some of the first to start losing jobs. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=258.22s)]
*  By the end of 2008, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=260.66s)]
*  when mass layoffs were gating steam, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=262.26s)]
*  industries that are not predominantly white collar [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=264.42s)]
*  were some that had the most job cut announcements. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=266.86s)]
*  That's excluding finance, which was in a crisis. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=269.65999999999997s)]
*  So the classic model we've seen over the past 30 to 40 years [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=272.94s)]
*  is that when companies see a slowdown coming, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=276.62s)]
*  they shed workers. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=279.18s)]
*  They figure, you know, we can always hire them back [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=280.34s)]
*  once business picks up again. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=282.5s)]
*  But that didn't happen after the pandemic. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=284.26s)]
*  But even if white collar workers are mostly affected [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=287.7s)]
*  by this downturn, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=290.26s)]
*  they don't typically stay unemployed for long. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=291.38s)]
*  The majority of tech workers who were laid off this year [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=294.26s)]
*  landed a new job within three months [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=296.94s)]
*  of starting their search. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=299.21999999999997s)]
*  Some smaller companies are finding it easier to hire now [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=300.74s)]
*  because, you know, there's more people on the market. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=303.38s)]
*  So just because there's a lot of layoffs [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=305.38s)]
*  doesn't mean no one's hiring. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=307.82s)]
*  Despite the layoffs, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=309.3s)]
*  the job market remains strong by historical standards. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=310.7s)]
*  The Fed is still looking for it to cool further. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=313.78s)]
*  The economists I've spoken with expect more layoffs. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=316.34s)]
*  They don't expect it to be like [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=319.34s)]
*  in the financial crisis when you saw [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=320.66s)]
*  pretty widespread layoffs. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=322.22s)]
*  They do expect layoffs to spread from, you know, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=323.98s)]
*  tech and the white collar to other areas [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=326.34000000000003s)]
*  where the economy may slow down next. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=329.74s)]
*  Some economists say that layoffs could become [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=332.1s)]
*  more precisely targeted and underperformers [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=334.34000000000003s)]
*  as companies try to hold on to their most valuable employees. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNpQQEaZFE&t=337.34000000000003s)]
