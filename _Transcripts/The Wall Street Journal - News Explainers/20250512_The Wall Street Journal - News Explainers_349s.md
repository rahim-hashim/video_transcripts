**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk)
*  In the tech war between the US and China, Beijing lags behind on cutting-edge semiconductors, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=0.0s)]
*  the chips that power everything from smartphones to artificial intelligence. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  The barrier to entry is really high because of the cost involved, the concentration in [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=11.44s)]
*  the industry and also the technical know-how. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=15.64s)]
*  Beijing's largest chip maker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  SMIC, plays a key role in China's push for chip self-sufficiency, but faces significant [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=23.2s)]
*  geopolitical challenges. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=29.36s)]
*  In 2020, citing national security concerns, the US imposed export restrictions on the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=31.6s)]
*  company, cutting off access to vital equipment needed to produce the most advanced chips [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=36.8s)]
*  and impacting its ability to close the gap with its larger rivals. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  But US efforts to keep the company in check appear to have had the opposite effect. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=47.4s)]
*  There is a growing awareness in Washington that there is an unintended consequence to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  the export controls and this unintended consequence has been that China has been galvanised to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=57.32s)]
*  create its own self-sufficient semiconductor industry. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=62.72s)]
*  SMIC was founded in 2000 by Richard Chang, a Taiwanese-American and a veteran of the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=67.32s)]
*  chip industry. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=73.64s)]
*  After studying in the US, Chang worked for American semiconductor giant Texas Instruments. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  Later, he returned to Taiwan, where he founded Scheder Semiconductor, which he then sold [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=80.44s)]
*  to Taiwan's TSMC, the world's most valuable semiconductor company. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  Chang then went to China, where he started SMIC. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=92.08s)]
*  Fast forward to today, it's actually become quite a juggernaut in the space. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=96.04s)]
*  It's a decent chip foundry, but in terms of the ability to make advanced chips, it's been [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=100.64s)]
*  very constrained. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=105.32s)]
*  US export controls have made it really, really difficult or impossible to buy the same sort [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=106.32s)]
*  of chip-making equipment that allows them to make advanced chips at scale, in bulk and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=111.64s)]
*  at a low cost. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=117.0s)]
*  Despite these difficulties, analysts believe SMIC is producing chips that can rival those [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=118.76s)]
*  produced by advanced factories in the US and Taiwan, including 7-nanometer chips like those [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  found in Huawei phones last year. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=130.52s)]
*  Many people expected SMIC to be unable to make these chips, at least unable to make [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=133.2s)]
*  them in the quantities Huawei needed to sell a high-end smartphone. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=137.96s)]
*  The speed of a chip is determined by how many transistors it contains. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=143.24s)]
*  The smaller the transistors, which are measured in nanometers, the more can be packed onto [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=147.52s)]
*  a chip, making it more powerful. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=152.36s)]
*  An industry teardown revealed that SMIC was the maker of these powerful chips that powered [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  or enabled the smartphone to offer the intelligent capability that it did. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=162.32s)]
*  So that was really a wake-up call for Washington. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=167.12s)]
*  However, SMIC still lags behind, with its two biggest rivals, Taiwan's TSMC and South [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=169.56s)]
*  Korea's Samsung, aiming to produce even more advanced chips. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=176.8s)]
*  TSMC and Samsung are now moving on to make 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer chips. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=181.56s)]
*  SMIC is only at the point where they're making 7-nanometer chips, but in much smaller quantities [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=186.76s)]
*  and not the commercial quantities that China really needs. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=192.44s)]
*  But analysts believe that Beijing's ramp-up in production, a drive to produce chips locally [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=196.56s)]
*  and major government investments will help China catch up. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=201.44s)]
*  The last installment of the National Integrated Circuit Fund was $48 billion, and that's money [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=205.8s)]
*  that's pumped in to grow the ecosystem, such as funding talent development programs, funding [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=211.8s)]
*  start-ups in this space, start-ups that are working on areas not just chip design but [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  chip production. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=222.68s)]
*  There are also start-ups that are working on making semiconductor manufacturing equipment [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=224.28s)]
*  that China is blocked out from. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=228.88s)]
*  So all that money is going in and it's helping to build a whole ecosystem domestically that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=230.52s)]
*  China can tap into in the future when it comes to semiconductors and chips. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=237.52s)]
*  In addition, local companies are also waking up to the need for China to be more self-reliant. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=242.68s)]
*  A lot of Chinese companies also saw the writing on the wall. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  So instead of just being a top-down effort by the Chinese government to push the localisation [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=252.28s)]
*  of the industry and push companies to use SMIC and not TSMC, Chinese companies decided [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=256.28s)]
*  that maybe we should divvy up a portion of our orders and pass it to a local company [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=262.0s)]
*  just in case we were cut off from Taiwanese foundries like TSMC or cut off from overseas [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=267.2s)]
*  chipmakers. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=273.8s)]
*  After imposing retaliatory tariffs on US goods last month, China also issued new rules on [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=275.68s)]
*  determining the origin of semiconductor imports. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=280.76s)]
*  Some analysts believe this move could give domestic chipmakers like SMIC an advantage [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=284.4s)]
*  in gaining market share over its US rivals. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=289.76s)]
*  What's more, a recent US Senate committee hearing saw top players in the AI industry [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=293.52s)]
*  speak out on the looming threat of China's technological advancements. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=298.36s)]
*  As a matter of economic security, as a matter of national security, America has to beat [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=304.44s)]
*  China in the AI race. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=311.52s)]
*  China is a really innovative country and the fact of the matter is they're making inroads [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=314.52s)]
*  in aspects such as EVs, rechargeable batteries, AI. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=319.04s)]
*  It's much more difficult to make the same strides very quickly in chips. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=323.64s)]
*  That said, the fact that China has made so much inroads and so many strides in such short [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=327.48s)]
*  of time really shows me that China shouldn't be taken for granted and in a couple of years [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=332.68s)]
*  could be as formidable as some of the Western rivals. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88mOUwxyJk&t=338.20000000000005s)]
