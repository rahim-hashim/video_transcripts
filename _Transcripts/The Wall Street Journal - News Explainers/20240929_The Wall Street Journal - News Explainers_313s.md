# Hezbollah’s Nasrallah Is Dead: What’s Next for Israel, Lebanon and Iran | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw)
*  Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah has been confirmed dead following a series of Israeli air strikes in Beirut. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a huge blow to Hezbollah and it comes at the end of two weeks of major strikes against Hezbollah's leadership. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=6.72s)]
*  The attack, carried out as Hezbollah leaders gathered in Beirut, has created a leadership void in the U.S.-designated terrorist group, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=15.84s)]
*  risking increased instability and potential conflict throughout the Middle East. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=23.04s)]
*  It's hard to emphasize how destabilizing this can be because Hezbollah over the last 20 years has grown into a state within a state. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=27.28s)]
*  Its weakness creates a bit of a vacuum in the country. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=36.96s)]
*  And following a series of attacks that left infrastructure and communications decimated, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  the death of Nasrallah leaves Hezbollah's future uncertain. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=45.84s)]
*  In addition to Nasrallah, the airstrike also claims the lives of some of the group's key commanders. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=51.2s)]
*  Experts have identified executive counsel Hesham Safi-Eldin as a potential successor, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=56.72s)]
*  though it remains unclear if he was also a casualty of the attacks. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=62.56s)]
*  And in the days since Nasrallah's death, Israel has continued to carry out attacks on Hezbollah targets. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=66.48s)]
*  So it's possible that the expected candidate was also killed. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=72.24s)]
*  They may land on sort of an interim candidate while they figure out what happens next. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  Experts say Hezbollah's leadership structure is designed for succession, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=81.44s)]
*  which likely guarantees continuity with several layers of potential replacements. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  The issue is that the further down you go in the organization, the less these people have been tested, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=89.92s)]
*  battle tested, and this is a moment in which Hezbollah is facing really potentially an existential threat. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=95.28s)]
*  Lebanon also faces the threat of escalating internal conflict as divisions deepen within its borders. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=101.36s)]
*  There's also the possibility that Hezbollah's political opponents across the country from [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=107.52s)]
*  the various ethnic and sectarian groups will try to seize on this opportunity to gain an upper hand [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=112.48s)]
*  over Hezbollah at what is almost certainly the weakest moment in its 40-something year history. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=119.84s)]
*  And while the group possesses a significant arsenal of rockets and weaponry, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=126.96s)]
*  they have yet to retaliate on a large scale. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=130.96s)]
*  Hezbollah has been trying to keep this conflict from escalating. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=133.6s)]
*  I think Hezbollah wouldn't want to be blamed by the rest of Lebanon for [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  bringing such destruction upon the country. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  Experts also suggest that Hezbollah may be weighing its options carefully before responding, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=145.92s)]
*  as Nasrallah's death not only impacts Hezbollah but also its allies, including its main backer, Iran. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  The understanding is that Iran is being consulted. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=157.04s)]
*  They're very heavily involved in Hezbollah operations and so Iran could mobilize some of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=160.64s)]
*  its other allies and proxies in the region. Houthis in Yemen could fire some more missiles [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  towards Israel. Iranian-backed groups in Iran and Syria could fire drones and send drones towards [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=169.92s)]
*  towards Israel. Then there's the more concerning potential that Iran takes out the precision-guided [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=176.32s)]
*  missiles and other powerful weapons to use against Israel. And also it could pursue more directly a [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=182.0s)]
*  nuclear program. I'm sort of making a calculation that its proxy strategy has failed and needs to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=188.72s)]
*  pursue a nuclear bomb in order to re-establish deterrence with Israel. Meanwhile, Israel has [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=194.48s)]
*  been preparing for retaliatory strikes and a potential ground invasion, deploying additional [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=200.72s)]
*  forces near the Lebanese border. In a military sense, it would be a logical time to launch an [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=205.6s)]
*  escalation to launch a ground invasion. Israel has said in recent days that its troops are massing on [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=211.92s)]
*  the border and preparing for that possibility. They haven't ruled it out. A senior Israeli [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=217.52s)]
*  official told the journal that the preference is to not have a ground invasion. They also have an [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=222.96s)]
*  experience of invading and occupying Lebanon. It's been a very unpleasant one. They're probably [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  trying to avoid that because it would likely be costly in terms of life for the Israelis. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=234.08s)]
*  An invasion would also, you know, could set off a chain of reactions, responses from from Iran, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  for example. The United States is watching the situation closely, hoping Nasrallah's death might [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=246.56s)]
*  present opportunities to resurrect ceasefire talks. While remaining wary about broader regional [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  escalation. The Americans, the Western countries, are quite concerned about where this leads and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=259.68s)]
*  the possibility that by escalating Israel may be pushing the region towards a bigger conflict that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=265.68s)]
*  could involve Iran, which is something the U.S. certainly wants to avoid. And the escalating [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=274.0s)]
*  violence could plunge Lebanon deeper into crisis, heightening political instability and reigniting [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=278.48s)]
*  sectarian divides that could further fracture the nation. Lebanon is already in a financial crisis, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=284.4s)]
*  economic crisis. These people don't have anywhere to go. The communities that are hosting them don't [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=289.92s)]
*  really have the resources to support them. The international community and organizations are [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=295.52s)]
*  already stretched thin with multiple crises in Lebanon. So there's a potential that this really [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=301.52s)]
*  drives Lebanon off the cliff. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadFDkuksFw&t=306.47999999999996s)]
