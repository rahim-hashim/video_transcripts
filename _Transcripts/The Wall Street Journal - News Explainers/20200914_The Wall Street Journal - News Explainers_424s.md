# The Rise of TikTok: From Chinese App to Global Sensation | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 14, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY)
*  TikTok. It's the hugely popular app that's given rise to dance trends, viral recipes, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=0.0s)]
*  influencer mansions, and national security investigations. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=7.26s)]
*  We're looking at TikTok. We may be banning TikTok. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=11.52s)]
*  TikTok has caught on so fast, it's come to rival some of the world's biggest social [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=14.88s)]
*  media companies in just a few years. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Three words. Addictive. Fun. Addictive. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=22.36s)]
*  I think TikTok is unique in how quickly it's grown. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=28.76s)]
*  Before TikTok was a global sensation, it was a Chinese app called Douyin. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  Here's how TikTok became TikTok and racked up billions of downloads so quickly. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=38.28s)]
*  In 2012, a tech startup called ByteDance was founded by a Chinese entrepreneur in his late [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=44.88s)]
*  20s who admired Silicon Valley icons and had done a brief stint at Microsoft. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=50.24s)]
*  ByteDance has actually been around for eight years now. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=56.36s)]
*  In the company's origin story, you know, they talk about starting out of like a modest [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=59.68s)]
*  apartment in Beijing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=64.56s)]
*  And Zhang Yiming, so the founder and CEO of ByteDance, he was in part motivated to start [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=66.48s)]
*  ByteDance because he noticed how a lot of people in China were now reading the news [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=74.52s)]
*  off their phone. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=78.4s)]
*  After creating an AI-driven news platform that still exists today, ByteDance launched [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  a short video sharing app in 2016 called Douyin. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=84.8s)]
*  Users could upload videos, put popular songs in the background, and work with an array [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=88.92s)]
*  of editing tools all within the app. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=92.96s)]
*  Douyin in China was also kind of marketed as a way, let's say for companies or brands, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=95.2s)]
*  to get in touch with Gen Z. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=100.52s)]
*  But since it only operates in China, it's subject to Chinese regulations, which means [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=103.32s)]
*  certain topics can be censored. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=108.32s)]
*  If ByteDance wanted to go global with the app, it had to make some tweaks for international [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=111.04s)]
*  markets. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  So in 2017, TikTok was born. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  Douyin stayed in Chinese app stores, and TikTok was made available on Apple and Google Play [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=119.64s)]
*  stores abroad. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=125.04s)]
*  In its first year on the global market, ByteDance acquired Musical.ly, a lip-syncing app popular [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=126.44000000000001s)]
*  in North America, and folded it into TikTok. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  I thought this was an app for teens. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=134.52s)]
*  I thought, no way am I going to like this thing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=136.8s)]
*  I just figured, okay, they're dancing on there, they're telling funny jokes, they're [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=139.88s)]
*  doing pranks. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=144.0s)]
*  This is what TikTok is all about. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=145.0s)]
*  Joanna Stern, the journal's personal tech columnist, says she was hooked. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=147.68s)]
*  And many users seemed to agree. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  Just a year after its launch, TikTok was one of the top 10 apps downloaded globally. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=157.16s)]
*  I became pretty obsessed with watching these memes where people would use Iggy Azalea's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=162.0s)]
*  walk a mile in these Louboutins song. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=166.92s)]
*  Walk a mile in these Louboutins. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  By 2019, TikTok was available in 150 countries and 75 languages, rivaling some of the world's [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  biggest apps like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=180.88s)]
*  And as many users started using it as a platform to release more politically charged videos [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=185.0s)]
*  on issues including Brexit and the US election, TikTok has been accused of taking down content [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  that's sensitive in China, including pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=195.54s)]
*  TikTok repeatedly pushed back, saying that it operates independently and that political [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=200.62s)]
*  content is allowed as long as it's lighthearted and creative. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=205.82s)]
*  I think the big thing that happened in 2020 is that you had TikTok becoming far more appealing [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=209.14s)]
*  to older users. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=215.38s)]
*  The teens sort of had set the pace on TikTok, they created a ton of content, and then you [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=216.98s)]
*  had these older generations coming on and sharing more about their professions, about [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=221.72s)]
*  the world, about politics. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=227.08s)]
*  And I think that was a pretty big turning point from this social network going from [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=228.6s)]
*  fun, dancing, yay, rainbows, to a real world social network. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=233.28s)]
*  In April, TikTok hit 2 billion global downloads. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=238.5s)]
*  But that level of global attention also brought questions into whether the Chinese-owned app [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=242.16s)]
*  poses national security risks. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=247.12s)]
*  Shouldn't we be considering right now, tonight, a ban on Chinese social media apps, especially [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=249.32s)]
*  TikTok? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=255.68s)]
*  All of your viewers should know we're taking this very seriously. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=256.68s)]
*  We're certainly looking at it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=259.56s)]
*  After the Trump administration labeled TikTok as a national security threat and accused [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=261.2s)]
*  it of potentially sharing data with the Chinese government, the company responded that it [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=265.44s)]
*  wouldn't share user information with the Chinese authorities even if they asked. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=270.12s)]
*  Other governments, including the European Union and Australia, have launched investigations [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=274.32s)]
*  into TikTok as well. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=278.84s)]
*  India, TikTok's largest foreign market, went so far as to ban the app in June. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=280.35999999999996s)]
*  And it's not just politicians watching TikTok's every move. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=286.76s)]
*  Social media companies are trying to replicate the app's success with young people. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=290.84s)]
*  I think TikTok is unique because it doesn't require a social network to push you content. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=295.23999999999995s)]
*  And I think that makes it very different from Twitter and Facebook, right, which is all [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=301.64s)]
*  about your connections. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=305.91999999999996s)]
*  But I think TikTok totally is kind of divorced from that, right? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=307.36s)]
*  You don't really need to follow anybody for you to use the app or for it to start learning [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=310.92s)]
*  from your browsing behavior. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  Part of what makes TikTok so popular and addictive is its hyper-personalized feed called the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  For You page. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=325.0s)]
*  The algorithm analyzes how long users watch each video and instantly serves up a new one [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  based on their viewing patterns. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=330.92s)]
*  And a lot of the content is relatable across country borders. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=333.2s)]
*  So if you're scrolling TikTok from the US, you might see videos from people everywhere [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=336.88s)]
*  from France to Indonesia or the UK, not just people nearby. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=340.6s)]
*  We're now seeing lots of social media platforms trying to clone TikTok. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=345.32s)]
*  But what we're seeing is they can't actually do that without the algorithm, without the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=349.52s)]
*  content that then fuels people to keep watching. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=353.48s)]
*  Instagram has introduced a new Reels feature that many users say is similar to TikTok's [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=358.24s)]
*  but still doesn't feel nearly as addictive as scrolling through TikTok. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=364.08s)]
*  Instagram said it's constantly looking for ways to improve user experience. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=368.52s)]
*  With the threat of a ban on TikTok, many TikTokers seem less concerned about personal data and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=372.76s)]
*  more about keeping TikTok what it is. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=378.64s)]
*  The secret sauce really seemed to be the combination of music, short videos and easy editing tools. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=380.88s)]
*  And then this algorithmic feed, the for you feed, which dropped you into this immersive [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=387.68s)]
*  experience and didn't give you a lot of choice. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=393.64s)]
*  I don't think it's easy enough to just say we're going to clone that. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=396.6s)]
*  And so I think that might be something that we all end up missing. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=401.04s)]
*  In mid-September, as it hoped to avoid a ban of TikTok in the US, ByteDance submitted a [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=404.78000000000003s)]
*  proposal to the Trump administration to work with Oracle, an American company, to address [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=410.16s)]
*  national security concerns. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  The deal has to be approved by the Trump administration. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2VO6ELhwQY&t=417.56s)]
