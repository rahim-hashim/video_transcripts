# Why an ISIS Comeback May Look Unlike Anything Seen Before  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 15, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo)
*  This video released by the Pentagon shows a raid on the compound of the Islamic State's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=0.0s)]
*  ideological leader and founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=6.88s)]
*  It resulted in his death and marked one of the biggest defeats for the militant group [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=11.68s)]
*  known as ISIS. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=15.6s)]
*  He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=16.6s)]
*  way. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=22.92s)]
*  The successor was announced just days later. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=23.92s)]
*  That was not the first major loss ISIS had suffered. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=26.680000000000003s)]
*  This is all ISIS. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=33.56s)]
*  Now on the bottom, that's as of today. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  This is ISIS. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=38.36s)]
*  There's none. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=39.36s)]
*  The caliphate is gone as of tonight. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=40.36s)]
*  That was a massive setback for the physical caliphate that had for years spread its brutal [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=46.36s)]
*  regime of terror across large areas of Iraq and Syria. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=51.099999999999994s)]
*  But as officials at the time warned, that wasn't the end of the militant group. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=56.66s)]
*  This is not the end of the fight against ISIS. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=61.06s)]
*  ISIS still lives on in various cells and in the minds of many of the people in the areas [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=63.5s)]
*  that we've liberated. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=68.06s)]
*  What that victory did not do was destroy ISIS as a military force. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=69.06s)]
*  Jennifer Cafarella is a Syria and ISIS specialist and one of the authors of ISIS's second [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=75.5s)]
*  comeback. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=80.66s)]
*  It's an assessment that uses declassified information and research to develop a picture [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=81.66s)]
*  of the next ISIS resurgence. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=86.7s)]
*  ISIS had already dispersed into populated areas as well as ungoverned spaces like the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=89.06s)]
*  Syrian desert in central Syria to regroup and return to an offensive campaign as an [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=94.5s)]
*  insurgency. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=100.53999999999999s)]
*  Following the defeat of the physical caliphate was a string of attacks. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=104.38s)]
*  Several in Afghanistan including one on a government building that killed seven. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=109.54s)]
*  But the biggest of the attacks was the so-called Easter bombings in Sri Lanka where a series [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=114.46000000000001s)]
*  of blasts killed more than 300 people. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=119.9s)]
*  Just a few days after that there was a call from its now deceased leader to redouble efforts [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=123.42s)]
*  and further the extremist group's cause around the world. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=127.7s)]
*  So we saw several messages from Baghdadi and others really urging people to continue promising [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=131.1s)]
*  the return of some form of the Islamic State. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=136.58s)]
*  We started hearing about attacks being inspired. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=139.46s)]
*  We heard about funding going to places like Afghanistan to sort of expand the caliphate [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=141.78s)]
*  in that way. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=146.02s)]
*  But as the group continued to spread its ideology globally a decision by President Trump to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=149.3s)]
*  pull US forces out of Syria shocked the region intensifying the fear of a physical ISIS resurgence. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  The worst thing any commander in chief can do to the soldiers is to give back to the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=163.54000000000002s)]
*  enemy land taken through blood and sacrifice. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=167.78s)]
*  As the US left, Turkey and Turkish backed forces advanced into Syria seizing territory [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=172.02s)]
*  held by Kurdish forces. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=176.98000000000002s)]
*  Those same Kurdish forces guarding some prison camps and detention centers holding ISIS prisoners [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=179.62s)]
*  and family members linked to Islamic State. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=184.58s)]
*  According to Syrian Democratic Forces or SDF there are just over 12,000 ISIS fighters in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=188.3s)]
*  including more than 2,000 foreign fighters. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=194.18s)]
*  And estimates from US forces on the ground say there are tens of thousands of ISIS family [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=197.18s)]
*  members scattered across internally displaced people camps or IDPs. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=201.78s)]
*  What you can see here in red are facilities from which ISIS has succeeded or attempted [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=206.86s)]
*  to break out family members and fighters from prisons. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=212.7s)]
*  Now those breakouts thus far are not highly coordinated. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=216.34s)]
*  So we're talking about riots and small levels of ISIS members paying bribes essentially [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=220.66s)]
*  to guards so that they can escape or be smuggled out of these facilities. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=227.62s)]
*  While Turkish President Rajat Tayyip Erdogan assured Trump he would secure the prisons [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=233.5s)]
*  inside the proposed safe zone, some of the most important ones are located outside of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=237.78s)]
*  that and it's not just the prisons under threat. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=243.1s)]
*  The instability in Syria is a major concern for neighboring Iraq. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=246.18s)]
*  On both sides, in Syria here and on the Iraqi side, this is ungoverned desert. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=250.29999999999998s)]
*  Now there are small pockets of the border essentially that the Iraqis are securing but [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=255.66s)]
*  the rest of this is essentially desert and therefore ISIS can traverse it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=261.9s)]
*  There are also concerns that the other players in the region involved don't have any interest [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=267.02s)]
*  in keeping ISIS at bay. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=271.09999999999997s)]
*  The US withdrawal from northeast Syria creates a security vacuum and multiple actors are [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=272.94s)]
*  now going to compete with military force to fill that vacuum. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=277.62s)]
*  All of the other actors in this region are fighting in Syria for different goals that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=281.86s)]
*  they prioritize far and above beyond the threat from ISIS and frankly that includes the Kurds. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=285.98s)]
*  We've accelerated basically the disintegration of the unity of effort against ISIS that only [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=292.54s)]
*  the United States was able to create. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=298.1s)]
*  But how concerned should we be with these threats and what might an ISIS resurgence [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=302.26s)]
*  look like? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=307.06s)]
*  What one has to watch for is how they sort of try to reconstitute or rebuild or rebrand [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=308.26s)]
*  themselves in a way such that they have learned from those lessons and are able to endure [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=312.98s)]
*  longer as a caliphate than they were the first time. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=317.38s)]
*  I don't have the imagination to tell you how that's going to go but that ideology remains [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=319.98s)]
*  a powerful one and one that inspires a lot of people and one that is expansive and worldwide. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=324.54s)]
*  The global ISIS expansion has included adding new formal provinces to the ISIS structure. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=330.90000000000003s)]
*  We've seen a redoubling of that ISIS effort to expand in Northern Africa and now an expansion [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=337.34000000000003s)]
*  farther south to the DRC and other Central African states. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=342.62s)]
*  We've simultaneously seen an expansion in the East Asia regions. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=347.46000000000004s)]
*  ISIS has had a province in Afghanistan since early in the caliphate but has now expanded [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=351.02000000000004s)]
*  to include a separate province in Pakistan and a separate province in India. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=356.94000000000005s)]
*  These ISIS provinces are in addition to what ISIS calls the East Asia province based in [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=361.12s)]
*  the Philippines where ISIS had achieved a major success in 2017, seizing the provincial [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=367.42s)]
*  capital of Marawi and defending it against the Philippine security forces for a number [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=372.58000000000004s)]
*  of weeks. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=377.70000000000005s)]
*  We've never had a terror group resurrect itself in the same form. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=378.70000000000005s)]
*  These groups have a way of metastasizing and reconstituting themselves in ways that perhaps [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=382.90000000000003s)]
*  we don't always have the imagination to foresee. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=387.46000000000004s)]
*  They still have millions of dollars in revenue and not nearly to the levels that they did [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=389.72s)]
*  at their peak. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=393.68s)]
*  When we think about the future of ISIS, I think it's really important to not be confined [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=394.82s)]
*  to that box of thinking of what it was in 2014, 2015, 2016 or to think of collapse strictly [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=398.72s)]
*  in the form of the physical caliphate because that virtual caliphate is as important and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=405.46s)]
*  arguably will be key to however it reconstitutes itself if it's able to. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrHSuIcgXJo&t=410.24s)]
