# Why Coronavirus Estimates Are Higher Than China's Official Tally  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 19, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c)
*  This massive metropolis in the center of China is at the heart of a virus outbreak that has gone global. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=0.0s)]
*  The first death from the new coronavirus outside of China. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  The cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, remains quarantined in Yokohama. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=11.8s)]
*  More than 71,000 people have been infected around the world. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=15.8s)]
*  In February, Chinese officials and state media touted a drop in the number of daily new confirmed cases. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  The new cases are decreasing. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=26.12s)]
*  But only hours later, local authorities released data showing a dramatic jump, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=29.28s)]
*  partially due to a shift in the way new cases were diagnosed and confirmed. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=34.96s)]
*  While the authorities said the goal behind the new criteria was to let more patients receive better treatment, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=39.92s)]
*  this raised concerns that the scale of the outbreak has been larger than Chinese data had earlier suggested. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=45.68s)]
*  We thought there was better transparency coming out of China, but it doesn't appear to be. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  In response to the criticism, Beijing said it has been active and open toward cooperation with international experts. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=56.44s)]
*  To independently assess the scale of the disease, groups of scientists around the world have been using mathematical modeling, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=63.56s)]
*  and their estimates so far exceed the officially reported numbers. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=70.44s)]
*  The new virus was first detected in December, and by mid-January, the number of cases was just over 40. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=76.68s)]
*  But epidemiologists across the world thought that something wasn't right when three cases were confirmed outside of China. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=84.24s)]
*  How could we have three or seven exported cases when there seemed to be relatively small numbers? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  Crystal Donnelly and her colleagues at the Imperial College London looked at the number of cases outside China, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=96.96s)]
*  which they call exported, to calculate the scale of the outbreak. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=102.96s)]
*  Wuhan's a big city. It has 19 million people in the metropolitan area, and it has an international airport and it's interconnected. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  So there are flights and people traveling to lots of places. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=114.0s)]
*  They used similar mathematical modeling developed during the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico in 2009. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=117.55999999999999s)]
*  You can look at the number of cases that have been exported, and then there is a factor which you can use to then estimate the number of cases that there were in the source region. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=124.52s)]
*  Before the virus shut down the city, the international airport operated flights to dozens of major cities worldwide, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=134.0s)]
*  with more than 3,000 passengers traveling through the airport every day. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=140.88s)]
*  The researchers also assumed that 10 days likely passed between a person getting infected and the disease being detected. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=145.96s)]
*  But you can get an idea by looking at the number of flights that come out of a population. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=153.44s)]
*  What's the population size? How many international departures do you have on a given day? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=158.0s)]
*  The Imperial College researchers estimated that over 1,700 people could have been infected in Wuhan by mid-January, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=163.12s)]
*  indicating a massive gap between China's 41 confirmed cases reported at that time and their estimates. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=170.8s)]
*  Other researchers did similar calculations based on the exported overseas cases and with several other variables, and came to similar results. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=177.8s)]
*  In later reports, scientists factored in new data, and their numbers were still much bigger than Beijing's official tally of confirmed cases. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=187.32s)]
*  These findings give a rough picture, and the margin of error remains high, in part because of other factors, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=195.72s)]
*  like the fact that human-to-human transmission was confirmed overseas. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=202.8s)]
*  Many people in China have been critical of how Beijing has dealt with the crisis and have been skeptical about the official data. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=208.72s)]
*  Donnelly says that the Imperial College's analysis is not aimed at criticizing Beijing's efforts, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=216.88s)]
*  but trying to look at what was going on and what might be expected from the virus. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  She says that there are a myriad of reasons why China's figures might not reflect reality. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  It's difficult for any country, if a new disease starts in your country, there's a lot to be identified to begin with. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=233.04s)]
*  So when it first starts, you really don't know what its potential is. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=238.44s)]
*  What makes it even harder to diagnose the coronavirus is that people infected may show very mild symptoms, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=241.56s)]
*  like fever and coughing, that are also common in other types of infections. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=247.8s)]
*  In an effort to battle the virus, Beijing has spent about $800 million, deployed thousands of medical staff, and built two field hospitals in days. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=252.44s)]
*  China is doing many good things that's slowing the virus, and this has to be recognized. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=262.8s)]
*  While the WHO repeatedly praised China, other public health experts have been more critical. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=268.88s)]
*  It took the agency nearly two weeks to get a go-ahead from Beijing to send a group of experts to China to conduct joint research with Chinese scientists. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=275.48s)]
*  Epidemiologists say they are still learning about the new virus, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=284.12s)]
*  and hope their research will help officials in China to put effective measures in place to tackle the outbreak. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kz54wBKi2c&t=288.15999999999997s)]
