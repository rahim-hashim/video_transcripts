# Inside Apple’s Rise to $2 Trillion  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 11, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY)
*  This August, Apple became the most valuable publicly traded company in the world, overtaking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=0.0s)]
*  Aramco as its market cap soared past $2 trillion for the first time ever. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=7.32s)]
*  And that is a $2 trillion milestone. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=12.6s)]
*  Shares of the company increased nearly 60% this year. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  It really is history. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=19.32s)]
*  But the company's road to $2 trillion hasn't been a straight climb. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=21.2s)]
*  After founder Steve Jobs passed away in 2011, many investors doubted that his successor [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=26.56s)]
*  Tim Cook could fill his shoes and propel the company forward. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=32.36s)]
*  Really a trillion dollar market cap wasn't part of the discussion back then. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=36.8s)]
*  It was much more about whether Tim Cook could even sustain the level of success that they'd had. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  But amidst lawsuits, regulatory investigations, and an ongoing trade war, Apple's shares [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=46.92s)]
*  have surged. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  This is how Apple became the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=53.96s)]
*  Apple first launched its Apple II home computer in 1977, revolutionizing the industry and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=65.04s)]
*  the world. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=71.48s)]
*  But to follow its rise to the very top, a good place to start is August 2018, when Apple [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=72.6s)]
*  reached its $1 trillion market cap for the first time ever, surpassing other tech giants [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=78.74s)]
*  by billions of dollars. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=84.02s)]
*  The company was coming off one of its strongest years since the death of Steve Jobs. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=95.78s)]
*  Apple had had some stumbles up through 2016, and there were doubts about Tim Cook's leadership [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=100.82s)]
*  and the company's prospects in the China market. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=105.54s)]
*  Things started to stabilize really later that year and in 2017. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=110.10000000000001s)]
*  And by 2018, I think people had a sense that the company was really clicking again. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=113.86000000000001s)]
*  The iPhone X had come out and you saw the stock just continue to rise and rise and rise [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  and then in the middle of 2018, it kind of shot up to get over the milestone. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=123.02000000000001s)]
*  In July 2018, the company reported its best third quarter ever. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=127.98s)]
*  Its flagship iPhones remained widely popular, and sales from the App Store and other services [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=132.64s)]
*  had hit all-time highs. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=138.5s)]
*  But this wasn't going to last. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=140.85999999999999s)]
*  About a month later, Apple released a new suite of iPhones, which included its most [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=143.1s)]
*  expensive model yet. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  This is iPhone XS. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=149.56s)]
*  It is the most advanced iPhone we've ever created. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=154.14s)]
*  They were riding high in 2018. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=158.01999999999998s)]
*  Going into the launch of the new phones later that year, they were sounding very confident [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=159.76s)]
*  that those phones would succeed. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=163.76s)]
*  But things didn't go as expected. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=165.67999999999998s)]
*  In January 2019, Apple announced it had missed its expectation for iPhone sales. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=167.84s)]
*  This had a lot to do with the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  The Chinese economy was suffering and purchases of iPhones in China fell sharply. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  The higher-priced phone, I think people felt underwhelmed by the new features and questioned [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  whether it was worth spending that much. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=188.64s)]
*  In response, the company slashed its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in over [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=191.04s)]
*  15 years. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  Since its peak, the company lost more than $400 billion in market value. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  2018 turned out to be Apple's worst yearly stock performance since the financial crisis. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=203.11999999999998s)]
*  And for some skeptics, this fall from grace seemed to confirm their doubts that Tim Cook [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=208.0s)]
*  would successfully lead the company. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=212.92s)]
*  Then in March 2019, Cook moved to dramatically expand a strategy the company started in 2017. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=216.32s)]
*  Today we're excited to extend our services even further, making them even more entertaining, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=222.72s)]
*  more useful and more informative. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=229.68s)]
*  During a special event in Cupertino, California, the company announced the Apple credit card, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  Apple TV+, and a number of new finance, gaming and new services. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=237.72s)]
*  This was something that had already been set in motion before and that Tim Cook had really [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=242.24s)]
*  been hammering on for a couple of years at that point. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=246.68s)]
*  And it was really part of an effort to transform the company from being focused on gadgets [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=249.4s)]
*  to being focused on gadgets and the services that attach themselves to those gadgets. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=254.8s)]
*  Amid press around the event, Apple's stock price continued to rise. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=260.76s)]
*  The company's big bet on services was starting to pay off. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  In the spring of 2019, the U.S.-China trade war was gathering momentum. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=268.48s)]
*  Donald Trump was threatening and imposing new tariffs. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=272.88s)]
*  And there was a great concern for Apple that its iPhones and other gadgets could get more [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=276.72s)]
*  expensive for U.S. consumers as a consequence of this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=281.16s)]
*  For years, Trump has pressured Apple to move more of its production to the U.S. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  And that was something that really wasn't feasible on a mass scale for Apple. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  In fact, around this time, they were planning to shift manufacturing of the one product [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=292.96s)]
*  that they were still making in the U.S. over to China. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=299.68s)]
*  And that was their highest end Mac desktop computer. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=302.35999999999996s)]
*  Cook was able to largely navigate around the tariffs and avoid having much damage to Apple [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  as a consequence. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=313.24s)]
*  With key products such as iPhones exempted from sanctions, Apple's stock continued to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=314.56s)]
*  gain momentum. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  But amid a surge of growth, Apple's new focus on services brought scrutiny from federal [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=320.48s)]
*  regulators. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=325.36s)]
*  In the U.S., the company faced antitrust probes related to its App Store, where many of the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  services are based. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=331.68s)]
*  But this didn't seem to faze investors. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=333.88s)]
*  Over the course of the year, Apple has bought back around $80 billion worth of its own shares, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=336.16s)]
*  further juicing the stock price. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=342.0s)]
*  And by January 3rd, the company's share price had more than doubled from the year before. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  Apple's future looked promising. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=349.72s)]
*  And then this happened. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=351.64000000000004s)]
*  Chinese authorities have traced a new deadly virus back to this seafood market in the city [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  of Wuhan. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=358.20000000000005s)]
*  The coronavirus has spread to countries across the world. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=359.20000000000005s)]
*  Severe border restrictions and global share market freefalls are testing our politics, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=362.04s)]
*  economies and society. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=367.16s)]
*  As the coronavirus pandemic spread across the world, Apple's manufacturing hubs in [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=369.16s)]
*  China were hit especially hard. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=373.76000000000005s)]
*  Like most companies, Apple's stock nosedived in February of this year. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=376.4s)]
*  The coronavirus was scaring investors and Apple was probably more exposed to it than [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=381.88s)]
*  most companies because it had emanated from China. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=387.44s)]
*  Apple's contract manufacturers in China had to close their factories for a time as they [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=390.56s)]
*  dealt with the coronavirus impact. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=395.0s)]
*  But Apple's stock quickly bounced back. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=397.32s)]
*  In the U.S., the Federal Reserve enacted a colossal stimulus plan to pump cash into [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=399.52s)]
*  the economy, lifting the markets, including stocks like Apple. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=404.4s)]
*  And as people's lives changed, technology became even more essential. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=408.2s)]
*  There's a whole working from home thing going for you. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  During the pandemic period, people were at home, they had to work and their children [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=414.03999999999996s)]
*  had to use computers or tablets to be able to go to school. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=417.64s)]
*  People didn't have any other entertainment other than what they could do at home, so [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=422.35999999999996s)]
*  they were watching more TV programming and streaming music and downloading apps. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=425.64s)]
*  All that benefited Apple. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=430.84s)]
*  On July 30th, Apple released an earnings report that highlighted an 11% increase in revenue. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=432.82s)]
*  In April, we expected year over year performance to worsen, but we saw better than expected [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=438.5s)]
*  demand in May and June. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=444.21999999999997s)]
*  We attribute this increase in demand to several interactive causes, including a strong iPhone [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=447.15999999999997s)]
*  SE launch, continued economic stimulus. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=453.38s)]
*  Following the news, Apple's shares continued to balloon. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=457.65999999999997s)]
*  And on August 19th, the company reached a $2 trillion market cap for the first time [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=460.58s)]
*  ever, becoming the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=465.62s)]
*  At this point, people would bet against Apple's ability to execute, but at the same time, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=470.62s)]
*  there's no guarantee that the stock's going to keep going up the way it has. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=475.5s)]
*  Apple faces a number of significant challenges on the regulatory front. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=478.7s)]
*  It's a subject of antitrust investigations in the U.S. and Europe. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=483.41999999999996s)]
*  It's also at war with a number of companies that are criticizing it over its business [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=487.64s)]
*  practices in the App Store and elsewhere. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=492.02s)]
*  And it's more exposed than probably any other American company to the U.S.-China trade wars. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=494.84s)]
*  In the midst of a volatile market, Apple's shares continue to see big swings. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp6CwhayNZY&t=500.82s)]
