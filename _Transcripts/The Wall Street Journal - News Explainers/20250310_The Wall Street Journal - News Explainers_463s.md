Video Description: The U.S. paused all U.S. military aid to Ukraine after a contentious meeting between Trump and Zelensky. The prospect of Washington cutting off support to Kyiv in the face of Russian aggression has prompted European NATO members like Germany, France and the United Kingdom to step up. Europe doesn’t make enough—or in some cases any—of the air-defense systems or long-range rocket artillery that Ukraine relies on like the Patriot and ATACMS.

WSJ breaks down whether European NATO countries have the money, equipment and personnel to fill the gap.

# How Irreplaceable Is the U.S. Military Aid to Ukraine? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg)
*  The US paused all military aid to Ukraine days after a contentious meeting between President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump and President Zelensky. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=6.28s)]
*  Your country is in big trouble. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=7.84s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=9.68s)]
*  The prospect of Washington cutting all its support to Kiev has prompted European NATO [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=11.48s)]
*  members to step up, and it's forcing them to take a hard look at their own arsenals. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=15.88s)]
*  Could you take on Russia by yourselves? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=21.44s)]
*  Well... [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=23.56s)]
*  US capabilities are, for the most part, irreplaceable for Europe. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=25.2s)]
*  Here's a breakdown of whether European NATO countries have the money, equipment and personnel [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=30.84s)]
*  to fill the gap. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=36.12s)]
*  When it comes to military spending, the US is by far ahead of everyone else. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=38.64s)]
*  At $920 billion, Washington's annual defence budget is bigger than the next nine countries combined. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=42.96s)]
*  The US has spent decades, since World War II, building up a military that is both massive [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=49.56s)]
*  and technologically far ahead of anybody else. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=57.88s)]
*  Because of that, and because European defence plans were built on the assumption the US [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=62.88s)]
*  would be part of it, there are many of these areas Europe just hasn't invested in. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=67.72s)]
*  Following Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea, European countries started boosting their [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=72.48s)]
*  which has been decreasing or stagnant for years. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=78.27999999999999s)]
*  And Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 provided an incentive to spend more [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=81.44s)]
*  on security. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=86.55999999999999s)]
*  In 2024, Europe's defence spending growth hit a record high. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=87.55999999999999s)]
*  Still, European NATO members accounted for less than one-third of the Alliance's defence [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=92.55999999999999s)]
*  spending last year. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  President Trump wants that to change. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=98.8s)]
*  NATO had no money because they hadn't paid for years and I said, look, if you don't pay, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=101.0s)]
*  we're not going to be a part of NATO, we're not going to protect, we're not going to do [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=105.4s)]
*  what we're supposed to do. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=108.56s)]
*  To address this, the Alliance's secretary-general says it is crucial that all 32 members meet [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=110.12s)]
*  the target of spending at least 2% of GDP on defence. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=115.2s)]
*  I tell them, if you do not react to my phone calls, you might get phone calls from a very [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=119.28s)]
*  nice man in Washington. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=124.44s)]
*  Poland has answered that call. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=127.04s)]
*  The country, which borders Ukraine and Belarus, now spends more than 4% of its GDP on defence. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=128.76s)]
*  I don't want to be irritated when an American ally says, give me more, be stronger, be [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=135.4s)]
*  more resistant. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=144.6s)]
*  Because these words will find absolutely no reason. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=145.6s)]
*  Trump has also criticised European countries over the amount of direct support to Ukraine. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  We've given them much more than Europe and Europe should have given more than us because, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=158.12s)]
*  as you know, that's right there, that's the border. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=162.24s)]
*  The US has been Kiev's single largest donor since Russia's full-scale invasion. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=164.84s)]
*  But the amount of direct support received from European countries collectively surpasses [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=169.44s)]
*  Washington's, according to research group the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=173.96s)]
*  But money isn't the only thing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=178.64s)]
*  Capabilities, especially for Ukraine, are vital and there are certain capabilities that the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=181.0s)]
*  US brings that Europe cannot replace. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  Europe simply doesn't make enough, or in some cases any, of the air defence systems [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=192.0s)]
*  or long-range rocket artillery that Washington provides. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=196.2s)]
*  Currently, only the US produces Patriot air defence systems, which can shoot down Russian [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=199.52s)]
*  ballistic missiles and US-made Atacams have been especially effective at striking Russian [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=204.4s)]
*  supply lines. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=209.52s)]
*  If those US systems do not continue flowing to Ukraine, it will lose the ability to defend [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=211.12s)]
*  itself against what Russia is doing on the battlefield. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=218.52s)]
*  Since Russia's 2022 invasion, many European governments have pledged to ramp up weapons [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=223.28s)]
*  production in their own countries. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  But even with larger defence budgets, turning those words into action has been a challenge. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  Remember, most of these components and systems essentially went out of production after the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=234.88s)]
*  Cold War. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  So, Europe is trying to rebuild an industry that hasn't been in place in 30-something [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=241.64s)]
*  years. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  When Russia launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine, Europe restarted from almost a [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=251.55999999999997s)]
*  standing start its defence industry. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=257.64s)]
*  One of the biggest assets in Ukraine's arsenal has been self-propelled artillery, including [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=261.47999999999996s)]
*  howitzers. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=265.8s)]
*  Russian countries have allocated more than 400 of these systems to Ukraine since 2022. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=268.12s)]
*  These militaries used to have hundreds in their arsenals, but after post-Cold War downsizing [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=274.76s)]
*  and deliveries to Ukraine, some of their stocks have fallen to double digits. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=279.4s)]
*  Russia has more than 1,700. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=284.12s)]
*  And even though Moscow has lost more than 4,000 main battle tanks since 2022, its current [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=286.68s)]
*  stock of around 2,700 is far more than what these individual European militaries maintain [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=292.04s)]
*  after having thousands in their arsenals 30 years prior. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=298.20000000000005s)]
*  It's only when you combine all of Europe's stocks of self-propelled artillery and main [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  battle tanks that they have an edge over Moscow. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=306.48s)]
*  During an emergency European Union meeting on Ukraine, leaders pledged to strengthen [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=310.0s)]
*  their country's defences and stressed the need to boost arms further to maintain that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=314.12s)]
*  edge. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  Germany's taken a leading role and has broken ground on the first Patriot missile production [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=319.84s)]
*  facility in Europe. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=331.79999999999995s)]
*  The factory is expected to produce up to 1,000 Patriot missiles for NATO allies, but they [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=333.4s)]
*  aren't scheduled to be delivered until 2027. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  It's not improving as fast as the Ukrainians, as many Europeans want, and now with the added [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=340.55999999999995s)]
*  pressure from Washington, Europe needs to move even faster and it just is not in shape [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=347.96s)]
*  to do that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  In addition to sending weapons, France and the UK have proposed putting their country's [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=357.0s)]
*  troops in Ukraine if a ceasefire or peace deal is struck. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=360.68s)]
*  But British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says there must be some form of US backstop to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=364.91999999999996s)]
*  deter Russian attacks. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=369.47999999999996s)]
*  Trump has been non-committal. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=371.47999999999996s)]
*  If the British people are in your group and they get attacked, you know, I've always [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=373.48s)]
*  found about the British, they don't need much help. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=378.24s)]
*  They can take care of themselves very well. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=380.72s)]
*  The proposal comes as the major European militaries have roughly half the number of troops they [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=383.52000000000004s)]
*  had in the 90s. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=387.62s)]
*  The UK currently has about 140,000 active military personnel. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  Compare that to the US's 1.3 million and Russia's 1.1 million. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=394.20000000000005s)]
*  As the US scales back its support for Ukraine and possibly its military role on the continent, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=400.36s)]
*  European NATO countries will need to decide how to balance support for Kiev while strengthening [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=406.04s)]
*  their own defences. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=410.36s)]
*  If in the unlikely event that Europe were to face a war with Russia tomorrow without [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=412.08000000000004s)]
*  US support, which is extraordinarily unlikely, Europe probably would be able to hold its [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=418.16s)]
*  own. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=424.64s)]
*  The question is in five years, in a few years, if let's say there's some kind of peace reached [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=425.71999999999997s)]
*  in Ukraine and Russia is no longer using its military equipment to attack Ukraine and is [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  able to rebuild and Europe doesn't tackle the hard issues that it needs to tackle, what [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=438.76s)]
*  would it look like in a few years in a fight between Europe and Russia? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=446.0s)]
*  And that is really what has Europeans nervous. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg&t=450.8s)]
