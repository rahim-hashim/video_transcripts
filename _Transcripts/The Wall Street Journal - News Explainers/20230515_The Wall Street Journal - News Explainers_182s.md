**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8)
*  Turkey is headed to a runoff election on May 28. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=0.0s)]
*  We firmly believe that we will continue to serve our nation for the next five years. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=5.0s)]
*  The temporary results show that Erdogan has not received the trust he has been waiting for from society. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=13.0s)]
*  What happens in this election will have enormous stakes both for Turkey and for the rest of the world. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=21.0s)]
*  Turkey is a member of NATO, a member of the G20, one of the world's largest economies. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=27.0s)]
*  It's also a country that has a central geopolitical role in the Middle East and in the war between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=32.0s)]
*  Erdogan is one of the only world leaders who speaks regularly with Russia's President Vladimir Putin, making him an important channel into the Kremlin. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=38.0s)]
*  President Erdogan is facing a number of challenges to his re-election. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=47.0s)]
*  Turkey has been in a currency crisis over the last two plus years, in part due to his own economic decisions, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=51.0s)]
*  in which he has pressured the central bank into cutting interest rates in spite of Turkey's high rate of inflation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=58.0s)]
*  It's caused living standards to unravel. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=64.0s)]
*  The rising cost of food, of housing, of medicine has really narrowed Erdogan's power base and turned some people who used to vote for him against him. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=66.0s)]
*  Another challenge is the devastation caused by the earthquakes that shook Turkey and Syria in February. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=76.0s)]
*  It killed more than 56,000 people. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=82.0s)]
*  People living in the earthquake zone said that they were basically left alone and that state institutions, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=85.0s)]
*  including the emergency services, the police and the army, were slow to arrive, leaving thousands of people underneath the rubble waiting to be rescued. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=91.0s)]
*  If we live in a time where there is no change, we are living in a time where we need to try new people, new policies. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=105.0s)]
*  On the other hand, Kemal Kılıçdirolu is the long-serving leader of Turkey's largest opposition party, the Republican People's Party. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=116.0s)]
*  If Kılıçdirolu wins, it would be a historic victory for Turkey's opposition, and it would really breathe life into democratic institutions here in Turkey. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=124.0s)]
*  He's been a fixture in Turkish politics for decades. He has been leading the Turkish opposition over the last decade. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=133.0s)]
*  His profile as a kind of elder statesman positions himself as anti-Erdogan. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=140.0s)]
*  He likes to say that he doesn't use polarizing language. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=147.0s)]
*  At the same time, he's promising to accelerate Turkey's clampdown on immigrants, promising to push millions of Syrian and Afghan refugees out of the country. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=150.0s)]
*  Over the last 20 years, Erdogan has made himself into Turkey's most powerful leader in a century. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=164.0s)]
*  And if he's brought down through democratic means, that could inspire hope that other countries could do the same. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZppLuQiY8&t=170.0s)]
