# Three Key Ways the Debt Ceiling Could be Overhauled Before 2023  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws)
*  If it seems like the U.S. is constantly about to hit the debt limit, also known as the debt ceiling, it's because it is. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=0.0s)]
*  It's kind of like the horror film that Hollywood keeps making sequels of even though no one liked the first one. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=6.68s)]
*  Every few years, or sometimes months, Congress needs to vote to raise it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=12.52s)]
*  And they will need to do it again sometime in 2023, when Congress will look like this. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  A Republican-held House and a Democratic-held Senate with a Democrat in the White House. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=23.2s)]
*  And Republicans plan on using the debt ceiling as leverage to negotiate spending cuts. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=27.96s)]
*  The debt ceiling needs to be lifted. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=33.2s)]
*  But wouldn't it be a normal thing if we're $31 trillion in debt not to just give a blank check? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=35.32s)]
*  So while Congress still looks like this, Democrats are looking to act on the debt ceiling. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=42.32s)]
*  So it's not something Republicans can use next year. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=46.84s)]
*  Here are three things they might do in that lame duck session. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=49.96s)]
*  But first, a brief history lesson. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=54.76s)]
*  From what happened another time, Congress looked like this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=56.8s)]
*  The debt limit was raised many times through recent history without much debate until 2011, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=60.48s)]
*  when Republicans decided to use it as a bargaining chip to negotiate for more spending cuts. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=66.84s)]
*  The American people will not accept an increase in the debt limit without significant spending cuts and reforms. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  The three sides debated as the U.S. got closer and closer to defaulting until [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=78.08s)]
*  Congressional leaders reached a deal with the president [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=83.04s)]
*  just one day before Uncle Sam hit his credit limit. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=85.4s)]
*  The U.S. didn't default, but the country's perfect AAA rating was downgraded by S&P in part because of the fight. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=88.64s)]
*  We're no longer the gold standard as it relates to the world's economy. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=95.76s)]
*  Longer term, we may see a rise in borrowing costs. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=99.68s)]
*  If history repeats itself, that is a scary scenario for this government. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=102.36s)]
*  The U.S. can't default on its debt. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=107.36s)]
*  That would have huge implications for the economy worldwide. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  Even just getting close to the debt limit can cause big problems for the economy. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=112.0s)]
*  So to avoid a fight next year, Democrats this year have three options. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=116.48s)]
*  The first is to just get rid of the debt limit altogether. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=121.4s)]
*  The U.S. is one of two countries that even have one in the first place. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=125.48s)]
*  And there's already legislation introduced to make it like all these other countries. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=129.36s)]
*  So the Treasury could just take on as much debt as it needs to pay for spending that Congress already voted for. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=133.96s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was asked last year if she'd support the repeal. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=140.48s)]
*  Yes, I would. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=144.64s)]
*  I believe it's very destructive to put the president and myself, the Treasury secretary, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=145.68s)]
*  in a situation where we might be unable to pay the bills that result from those past decisions. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=153.88s)]
*  But Biden says he wouldn't sign it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=161.96s)]
*  You mean just say we don't have a debt limit? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=163.84s)]
*  No debt limit. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=165.44s)]
*  No. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=166.76s)]
*  So that's the least likely possibility. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=167.8s)]
*  The second is to just raise the debt limit so high it's not really a problem. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=170.08s)]
*  That's what the other country with a debt limit, Denmark, does. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=174.96s)]
*  Its debt would have to quadruple to reach its current limit. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=178.12s)]
*  The likely plan wouldn't be to raise the U.S. as that high, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=181.84s)]
*  but just enough to remove it as something that would need to be debated in 2023. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  It's not due till next year, but the Democrats could pass something, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=189.72000000000003s)]
*  potentially with Republican votes also in the Senate, that would raise it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  So we didn't have to worry about it, say, till 2024, 2025. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  But the most likely plan is to restructure the way the debt ceiling is raised in the first place [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=201.16s)]
*  and make it not Congress's problem. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=206.2s)]
*  The idea originates from that 2011 battle. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=208.6s)]
*  It was an idea that was brought forward by now Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=211.64s)]
*  who at the time was looking for ways to help his members avoid having to vote for the debt ceiling, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=216.4s)]
*  but give them a way to vote against it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=220.6s)]
*  Currently, a majority in the House and the Senate have to vote for raising the debt ceiling. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=222.56s)]
*  And then it's signed or vetoed by the president, like most bills. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=227.12s)]
*  But members of Congress, especially Republicans, don't like having to vote for raising the debt ceiling. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  So what several bipartisan plans would do is essentially reverse this. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  It would give the executive branch, so the president or even the Treasury secretary, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=241.32s)]
*  the authority to raise the debt limit. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=245.4s)]
*  And Congress could pass a joint resolution of disapproval. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=247.76s)]
*  Basically, Congress, instead of voting to affirmatively raise the debt ceiling, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=251.4s)]
*  members of Congress could vote basically against raising the debt ceiling. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=256.32s)]
*  But to actually override the executive branch, they would need a two-thirds majority vote. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=260.23999999999995s)]
*  However, not everyone wants to take the debate away from Congress, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=265.91999999999996s)]
*  simply because it's crises that make Congress actually get things done. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=269.55999999999995s)]
*  We find ourselves at the edge of cliffs a lot in Congress, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  and that seems to be one of the only motivators to get people to make concessions and reach agreements. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=276.32s)]
*  But on the debt ceiling, that is a very high-risk strategy. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=284.2s)]
*  Many Republicans want that high-risk strategy. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  To get spending cuts and other measures they worry they won't get under a Democratic president. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=289.56s)]
*  Republicans have tried to work with reach across the aisle and have been shut out of many of those conversations. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  If we could do that, then we wouldn't need to threaten, use the threat of the debt ceiling as a negotiating tool. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=299.68s)]
*  There are definitely divisions within the Republican Party about how they see that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=306.28s)]
*  Some of them really want it, want to go to the brink and force these changes. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  If they really believe they're important, and others don't think we should be using the debt ceiling that way, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=314.04s)]
*  and would rather just take care of it, maybe even would rather Democrats take care of it in the lame duck [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=318.96s)]
*  before they have to worry about it next year in their majority. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=322.52s)]
*  So Democrats have about two months to decide on one of these paths and potentially gain Republican support for it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=325.16s)]
*  Otherwise, come 2023, we'll likely see an epic debt limit debate again. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1Dzbx_xws&t=332.2s)]
