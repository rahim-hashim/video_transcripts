# Why the U.S. Stores About 400 Million Oil Barrels in Caves  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0)
*  This patch of land, about 70 miles outside of Houston, Texas, doesn't look like much. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=0.0s)]
*  But if you zoom in, these little rectangles sit above a powerful economic and political tool. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Just underground is a network of caverns full of oil, part of the U.S.'s Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=12.0s)]
*  Since March, President Biden has been tapping into it in a big way. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=19.68s)]
*  The Department of Energy released another 15 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Altogether, the administration will have released 180 million barrels in 2022, the largest drawdown from the SPR ever. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=29.52s)]
*  Pumping from the reserve, the administration says, has helped lower Americans' energy bills and stabilize markets. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=38.0s)]
*  But some oil industry experts disagree. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=44.8s)]
*  When we talk about the forces that are hitting the oil market, this does very little to change the tide. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=48.08s)]
*  Here's how the Strategic Petroleum Reserve can be used to try to bring down prices, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=53.92s)]
*  and why some are skeptical that Biden's moves are working. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=58.72s)]
*  Along the Texas and Louisiana coasts, the caverns are located in Bryan Mound, Big Hill, West Hackberry, and Bayou Choctaw. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=63.52s)]
*  As of October 28th, the reserve held about 399 million barrels of oil. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=72.32s)]
*  You know, we're talking about four storage sites, 60 caverns. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=77.92s)]
*  The largest one, I think, is big enough that you could fit the Willis Tower that you have in Chicago in it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=83.11999999999999s)]
*  And the tower, for reference, is 1451 feet. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=89.44s)]
*  So that's substantial. You can put a lot of oil in there. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=92.96s)]
*  So why does the U.S. government keep this much oil on hand? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  It goes back to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=100.08s)]
*  During the 1973-74 OPEC oil embargo, prices for oil skyrocketed. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=104.64s)]
*  As a result, we face the possibility of temporary fuel shortages and some increases in fuel prices in America. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=111.2s)]
*  This led to gasoline shortages across the country. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=118.0s)]
*  No gas. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=121.04s)]
*  No gas today? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  When President Ford signed the act into law, it was an attempt to establish a buffer against future supply shocks of this kind. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=124.4s)]
*  It's specified that presidents can tap into the reserves when there's an energy supply interruption [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=131.28s)]
*  or due to obligations of the United States under the International Energy Program. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=136.4s)]
*  Over the years, that's meant a few things. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=141.36s)]
*  Historically, the U.S. has drowned into the SPR for emergency and non-emergency releases. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=143.84s)]
*  What's an emergency release? It's a hurricane that disrupts oil production. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=149.12s)]
*  What's a non-emergency drill? It's a sell mandated by Congress as part of policymaking. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=152.24s)]
*  Using that authority, Biden tapped into the reserves starting in the spring and through this fall. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=157.84s)]
*  We're going to continue to stabilize markets and decrease the prices at a time when the actions of other countries have caused such volatility. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  The market for oil has been very tight and the U.S. has had to balance the fight against [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  inflation and gasoline prices has been a main driver of that with targeting Russia and punishing it for its invasion of Ukraine. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=179.12s)]
*  Releases from the SPR can help calm oil traders by injecting more crude supplies into global markets. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=187.6s)]
*  Right now, oil supplies are tight, causing high prices. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=194.72s)]
*  By taking oil from the reserves and selling it to traders and refiners, Biden is increasing supply [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  in an effort to lower prices at the pump because gasoline prices are largely determined by oil prices. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=205.04s)]
*  This strategy has worked in the past. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=211.2s)]
*  Take when the government tapped into the reserve after Hurricane Katrina as an example. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=213.28s)]
*  The U.S. sold 11 million barrels to keep production steady for the rest of the country. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=218.0s)]
*  After the release, prices stabilized. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=222.72s)]
*  And something similar happened earlier this year due to Biden's March announcement [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=225.44s)]
*  when he said he'd release 1 million barrels a day. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=229.44s)]
*  Treasury Department estimates that the releases that we've seen this year lower the price of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=232.32s)]
*  gasoline between 13 and 31 cents per gallon. So that's a pretty broad range. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=238.4s)]
*  But industry critics say that the oil releases have artificially lowered prices in the short term, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=244.08s)]
*  dissuading investment in new oil production. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=249.36s)]
*  U.S. officials said they had intended the reserve releases to be a stopgap until domestic production [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=252.4s)]
*  ramped up. There's only been a slight increase in production so far this year, about 6 percent since [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=257.68s)]
*  January. And that's largely because the largest producers in the U.S. have been conservative with [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=263.36s)]
*  the spending. Biden has tried to deal with lower production by announcing that he would [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=269.12s)]
*  refill the reserve. That means oil companies can invest to ramp up production now with confidence [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=273.92s)]
*  they'll be able to sell their oil to us at that price in the future. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=280.48s)]
*  Seventy dollars. But analysts have said that shifting from releasing the reserves to refilling them [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  could remove large amounts of oil from the global market, which would continue to tighten supplies [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=290.64s)]
*  and contribute to inflation. They say that Biden should wait to refill the reserves until there's [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=296.0s)]
*  a surplus of oil and lower prices. The latest release from the reserve, the 15 million barrels, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=301.12s)]
*  are set to be delivered in December. Biden has said that he would ask his team at the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=307.6s)]
*  Department of Energy to, depending on the situation, make further releases from the SPR. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=312.0s)]
*  So he has not ruled out additional releases. Until the SPR is refilled, federal inventories [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=318.48s)]
*  are at a 38-year low. But Biden says there is still enough in case of emergency. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWeBUi44r0&t=324.4s)]
