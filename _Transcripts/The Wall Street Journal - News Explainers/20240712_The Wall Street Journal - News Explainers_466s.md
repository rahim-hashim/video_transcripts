# Biden in 2021 vs. 2024: How Signs of Aging Have Upended Presidential Race | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU)
*  After a wide-ranging news conference in which he demonstrated a firm grasp of key policies, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=0.0s)]
*  President Biden seemed to reassure some of his supporters. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=5.4s)]
*  But he has one of the best minds that I've ever been around. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=8.0s)]
*  But the event didn't squash all doubts about his ability to run for and serve as president, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=14.36s)]
*  with verbal flubs still making headlines. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=19.3s)]
*  Vice President Trump. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=21.44s)]
*  In the past, the quote-unquote bad moments were viewed as gaffes. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=22.72s)]
*  Fast forward to now and it's a very different thing. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=26.6s)]
*  Many geriatricians who have seen videos of the president say Biden is simply showing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=30.6s)]
*  normal signs of aging and not necessarily cognitive decline. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=34.4s)]
*  I just gotta just pace myself a little more. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=38.6s)]
*  But following his poor performance in last month's debate, a WSJ poll found that 80% [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=41.84s)]
*  of voters nationwide now say Biden is too old to run for a second term, a concern that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=46.64s)]
*  Biden and the White House are pushing back on. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=51.78s)]
*  He is as sharp as ever. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=54.84s)]
*  Here's a look at footage of Biden now versus a few years ago and why many recent moments [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=56.96s)]
*  are raising concerns. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=61.96s)]
*  Even before he took office, President Biden's age was under scrutiny. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=64.84s)]
*  But today, his every move is under a microscope. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=68.9s)]
*  From his expressions to his speech. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=72.30000000000001s)]
*  She knew so long as I was nine. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=75.0s)]
*  To his ability to recall words and finish thoughts. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=78.86s)]
*  If we finally beat Medicare. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=82.0s)]
*  Biden's inner circle has kept a tight rein on his unscripted appearances to try and limit [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=87.4s)]
*  these kinds of moments. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=91.52s)]
*  But let's look at a recent interview and one from the beginning of his term. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=93.32s)]
*  In a 2021 sit down with ABC News, he appeared to follow questions with an attentive expression [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=97.32s)]
*  and he was quick with his responses. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=102.72s)]
*  Your top military advisors weren't against what's going on this timeline. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  They wanted you to keep about 2,500 troops. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=108.0s)]
*  No, they didn't. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=109.92s)]
*  It was split. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=111.04s)]
*  That wasn't true. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=112.04s)]
*  In a similar setting this month after the debate, Biden at times listened with an open [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=113.24s)]
*  mouth and appeared softer spoken and slower to respond. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=117.44s)]
*  What I want to get at is what were you experiencing as you were going through the debate? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=121.36s)]
*  Did you know how badly it was going? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=125.2s)]
*  Yeah, look. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  The whole way I prepared, nobody's fault, mine. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=131.24s)]
*  Nobody's fault but mine. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=134.72s)]
*  I prepared what I usually would do sitting down as I did come back with foreign leaders [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=137.84s)]
*  or the National Security Council for explicit detail. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=143.08s)]
*  And I realized about part way through that, you know, all the, I get quoted as the New [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=148.08s)]
*  York Times had me down at 10 points before the debate, nine now or whatever the hell it is. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=153.2s)]
*  Lawmakers, Democratic strategists who saw that interview did not find it to be something [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=158.68s)]
*  that, you know, eased their mind at all about Biden's acuity. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=165.16s)]
*  He will lose his train of thought, sort of not infrequently and has some trouble kind [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=169.2s)]
*  of grasping for words. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=176.24s)]
*  He tends to mumble and so he's not very audible. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=177.72s)]
*  And then at times he'll just sort of cut himself off. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=182.28s)]
*  President Biden has acknowledged his age. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=185.8s)]
*  I don't walk as easy as I used to. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=187.8s)]
*  I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=189.96s)]
*  I don't debate as well as I used to. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=192.48s)]
*  But I know what I do know. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  I know how to tell the truth. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=198.32s)]
*  He has also had several stronger moments this year, like his State of the Union address. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=200.04s)]
*  I know it may not look like it, but I've been around a while. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=205.0s)]
*  But critics say his performance in unscripted moments has become harder to follow. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=208.04s)]
*  For example, here's Biden discussing the Trump administration's handling of COVID in 2021. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=212.92s)]
*  The circumstance relating to how the administration was handling COVID was even more dire than [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=218.48s)]
*  we thought. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=223.88s)]
*  The Trump administration? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=224.88s)]
*  The Trump administration. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=225.88s)]
*  We thought they indicated there was a lot more vaccine available and it didn't turn [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  out to be the case. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  And here's Biden in 2024 talking about Trump and COVID again. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=233.56s)]
*  He's, the way he managed the end of his last year when we were dealing with COVID, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=237.76s)]
*  A million people died. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=246.12s)]
*  He told people inject bleach that may do it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=247.12s)]
*  In recent months, Biden's struggle to recall names and words has also caused concern. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=250.4s)]
*  For example, he introduced President Zelensky of Ukraine as [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=255.44s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=259.24s)]
*  President Putin. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=261.28s)]
*  He's going to be President Putin. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=263.28s)]
*  President Zelensky. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=265.68s)]
*  In June, he appeared to momentarily forget the name of a cabinet member. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=267.0s)]
*  All the members of Congress and Homeland Security, Secretary, I'm not sure I'm going to do [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=270.76s)]
*  show away. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=277.71999999999997s)]
*  But all kidnascides, Secretary Marikas. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  Then, according to a White House transcript, Biden repeatedly referred to France as Italy [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=281.2s)]
*  while speaking at a campaign reception a few weeks ago. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=285.76s)]
*  And in his debate with Trump, several of Biden's answers confused the audience. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=289.2s)]
*  Do you support any legal limits on how late a woman should be able to terminate a pregnancy? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=293.44s)]
*  I support Roe v. Wade, which had three trimesters. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=298.36s)]
*  The first time is between the woman and the doctor. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=302.24s)]
*  Second time is between the doctor and an extreme situation. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=304.88s)]
*  The third time is between the doctor, I mean, between the woman and the state. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=308.84s)]
*  The White House has said the debate was simply a bad night and has maintained that Biden [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=314.08s)]
*  is on top of his game. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=318.2s)]
*  He's on fire. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=319.76s)]
*  He's ready to go. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  The sort of instinct is to just not give an inch here. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=322.52s)]
*  Now, Biden himself has shifted since the debate. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=326.6s)]
*  Those explanations and the problem the White House has is once you start giving any ground, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=330.44s)]
*  those explanations start to raise new questions. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=335.4s)]
*  The White House has also pushed back on claims about Biden, quote, freezing and needing to [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=338.56s)]
*  be escorted. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=343.12s)]
*  While Biden has frequently walked with others at engagements, he made headlines at a recent [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=344.56s)]
*  fundraiser when, after waving to the crowd, he stood still for several seconds. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=348.64s)]
*  And then was let off stage by former President Obama. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=356.72s)]
*  President Obama's office put out a statement, so I would refer you to that statement, about [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=359.64s)]
*  what was being accused by others. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=365.36s)]
*  And he said this did not happen in the sense of what people were saying they were seeing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=369.68s)]
*  But the host of that fundraiser, actor George Clooney, wrote an opinion piece saying that [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=374.0s)]
*  the Joe Biden on stage was not even the Joe Biden of 2020. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=378.32s)]
*  And he called for the president to step aside. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=382.68s)]
*  While signs of Biden's aging have prompted many American voters to say he's too old [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=385.52s)]
*  to run again, Biden has refused to drop out of the race. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=389.68s)]
*  There's so much we can do still. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=393.56s)]
*  I'm determined to get it done. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=396.88s)]
*  And for now, several Democrats are publicly standing by him. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=399.32s)]
*  As I've said before, I'm with Joe. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=403.44s)]
*  But some are calling for him to step aside, and others are pushing him to reconsider. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=406.32s)]
*  This race is on a trajectory that is very worrisome if you care about the future of [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=411.72s)]
*  this country. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=416.8s)]
*  I don't think anyone wanted to see the spectacle at the debate, but we can't unsee that now. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=417.8s)]
*  If you're a Democrat, the risks of him staying on the ticket is that the Democratic Party [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=423.26000000000005s)]
*  loses the White House. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=428.20000000000005s)]
*  But he also brings down Democrats who are in front line competitive races in both the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=429.92s)]
*  House and the Senate. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=435.44000000000005s)]
*  If you're Joe Biden, you've spent 50 years trying to get this job. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=436.8s)]
*  And he and other Democrats think that he has done a really good job at it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=440.44s)]
*  So for Biden to give it up, psychologically, is a very difficult, very difficult thing [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=444.88s)]
*  to do. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=450.24s)]
*  But I can guarantee you there are Democrats who are thinking about it and plotting it [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=451.24s)]
*  out right now in case that is a possibility, in case the president decides that he should [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=454.12s)]
*  not stand for reelection. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSdBYomClU&t=459.1s)]
