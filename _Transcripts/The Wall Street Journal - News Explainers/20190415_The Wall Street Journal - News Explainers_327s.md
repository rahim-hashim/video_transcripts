# Why Robocalls Are Almost Impossible to Stop  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 15, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM)
*  This is a call from a debt collector. Please consider donating to Veterans of America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=0.0s)]
*  We are calling you from the investigation team of IRS. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=7.2s)]
*  Do these kinds of robocalls sound familiar? How about just plain annoying? If you live [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=10.86s)]
*  in the US, the answer is probably yes. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=15.92s)]
*  One robocalling app found that there were 26.3 billion unwanted robocalls made to US [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=19.14s)]
*  mobile phones in 2018. And another blocking app put that number much higher, estimating [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=24.52s)]
*  that there were nearly 48 billion. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=29.72s)]
*  But these calls aren't just annoying. They're also costing US citizens a lot of money, scamming [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=32.56s)]
*  them out of $9.5 billion in 2017. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=37.56s)]
*  So why can't the FCC and Federal Trade Commission stop them? Well, it's not that simple. Robocalls [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=42.48s)]
*  are nearly impossible to stop. Here's why. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=48.2s)]
*  The internet has made it easier and cheaper for robocallers. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  In pre-internet days, phone calls were transmitted over a landline from caller A to receiver [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=58.88s)]
*  B. But now, through a simple click of a button on their computer, a robocaller can call tens [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=63.96s)]
*  of thousands of phones simultaneously. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=69.2s)]
*  On top of that, they can obscure the origin of their calls. For example, a robocaller [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=71.84s)]
*  in a country overseas can legally buy US phone numbers and use those numbers to make their [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=76.64s)]
*  calls. Their goal is to trick recipients into thinking they're receiving a call from the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=81.88s)]
*  US. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=86.4s)]
*  Internet-based voice systems allow scammers overseas to operate cheaply and more easily [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=88.72s)]
*  to make millions of robocalls from abroad. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=94.2s)]
*  The FCC has ordered cell phone carriers make sure every call that's initiated makes it [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=98.92s)]
*  through to the receiver. The point of this was in part to prevent the carriers from neglecting [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=103.36s)]
*  customers in rural areas where service can be dodgy. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=107.8s)]
*  But because of these mandates, carriers are wary of blocking suspected robocallers out [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  of fear of violating these rules. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=115.64s)]
*  To help fix this problem, the FCC in 2017 adopted specific rules that give carriers [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=117.86s)]
*  the ability to block calls that are coming from obviously invalid numbers. For example, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=123.64s)]
*  they can now block calls that don't contain the right number of digits, numbers that are [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=128.7s)]
*  single digit repeated, numbers that are coming from a fake area code, and more. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=132.34s)]
*  But even with these new rules, illegal calls continue. Some scammers use sophisticated tactics [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=137.0s)]
*  to hide their identity, such as spoofing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=142.22s)]
*  For example, a call may look like it's coming from an area code close to where the recipient [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=145.34s)]
*  lives in order to encourage them to answer. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=149.34s)]
*  Regulators have brought hefty fines in recent years to punish robocallers in an effort to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=154.7s)]
*  regain ill-gotten assets. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=159.0s)]
*  Look at this chart. It shows the difference between how much the FCC has ordered wrongdoers [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=162.12s)]
*  to pay versus how much the government has actually collected. That's $208 million versus [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=166.44s)]
*  $7,000. It has to rely on the Justice Department to collect the fines at issues. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=172.34s)]
*  The FTC has had a similar experience. The total it's secured in court judgments for cases [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=178.22s)]
*  involving the violations in this chart, plus the amount requested to pay back to wronged [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=183.04s)]
*  consumers is $1.5 billion since 2004. But so far, it's only collected $121 million. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=187.7s)]
*  In May of 2018, the FCC fined a Florida-based company and its top executive $120 million [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=197.34s)]
*  for making 100 million illegal robocalls in 2016. But agency records as of late December [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=203.98000000000002s)]
*  indicate that no funds had been collected. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=209.34s)]
*  One reason for the difficulty in holding robocallers accountable is that they're often very small [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=212.22s)]
*  operations that are unable to pay the full penalties. According to enforcement officials, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=216.78s)]
*  These operations can quickly close up shop and change their names or hide their assets. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=221.72s)]
*  Another reason robocalls are unlikely to disappear is that many are actually legal and useful [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=228.04s)]
*  for the recipient. According to a 2018 study, more than 60% of robocalls were legitimate [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=232.22s)]
*  calls like telemarketers, reminders, and alerts. And that's what's tricky. There's a difference [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=242.18s)]
*  between unwanted and illegal robocalls. You may not want to hear from a debt collector, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=247.12s)]
*  but they may have the right to call you because of terms of service you've signed. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=252.0s)]
*  Further complicating things is that the call centers or number sellers hired for legitimate [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=255.6s)]
*  purposes can also be used by scammers. This makes it difficult for carriers to distinguish [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=259.38s)]
*  between legal and illegal robocalling. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=264.54s)]
*  Finally, many robocallers aren't actually calling you from the US. This makes it even [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=267.9s)]
*  harder for authorities to hold illegal robocallers accountable. If a robocaller is calling the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=273.48s)]
*  US from another country, it's difficult for government officials to identify bad actors. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=278.86s)]
*  And even when they are able to identify the robocaller, they may not have the jurisdiction [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=283.78000000000003s)]
*  to punish them. In response to these problems, the FCC has demanded that the telecommunications [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  industry develop solutions to help stop robocalls and spoofed calling numbers. The industry [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=293.0s)]
*  has since come up with STIR and SHAKEN, two protocols that help verify whether the phone [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=298.32s)]
*  number of a caller is legitimate. Once deployed, call recipients will have a symbol pop up [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=302.98s)]
*  on their phone that indicates whether the caller is legitimate. But even those systems [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=308.42s)]
*  won't stop all robocalls. They'll simply signal when a call has been verified. That [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=313.34000000000003s)]
*  means your phone will still ring when an illegal robocaller is trying to reach you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzJM29nCjM&t=317.74s)]
