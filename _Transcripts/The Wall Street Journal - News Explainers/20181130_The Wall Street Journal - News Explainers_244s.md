# Three Ways to Stay Safer Online
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 30, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA)
*  This is my house key. Without it, there's no way in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=0.0s)]
*  And this, the YubiKey 5, is my Gmail key. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=4.16s)]
*  Without it, there's no way in. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=7.36s)]
*  Believe it or not, my Gmail being as secure as [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=9.24s)]
*  my apartment is actually a huge improvement. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=11.56s)]
*  See, if there's one thing we've learned over the last couple of years, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=14.48s)]
*  it's that the easiest way to be safe online is just to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=16.88s)]
*  assume that everyone is being hacked all the time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=19.92s)]
*  This was the biggest hack of one company users ever. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=22.64s)]
*  The hackers have once again infiltrated sensitive government and private sector information. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=27.12s)]
*  When the recipient clicks on them, hackers invade their computers and move around. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  Data leaks out for lots of reasons, but one big one is that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=36.44s)]
*  the way we secure ourselves online is just terrible. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=39.68s)]
*  You probably don't follow all the password rules, picking a strong one, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=43.28s)]
*  picking a different one for every service, changing them all every 90 days. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  And even if you do, you're still forced to trust that all that data is being stored securely. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=49.52s)]
*  The best solution we have so far is called two-factor authentication. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=54.16s)]
*  Once you've turned it on, which you do usually in the settings of any supported app or website, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  it will make sure that not only are you putting in the right username and password, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=62.28s)]
*  but that it's you doing so based on something you have, like your phone. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=65.47999999999999s)]
*  There are three tiers, I guess you'd call it, of two-factor authentication. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=69.36s)]
*  The least secure and most common is text messaging. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=73.56s)]
*  You log in and the site sends you a code, usually six digits or so via text. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=76.72s)]
*  Enter that code and you're in. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  Great, except it's been shown over and over how easily hackers can intercept a text message [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=82.04s)]
*  or trick you into putting all your information into a fake webpage. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  Again, I can't say this enough. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=90.64s)]
*  Even this is better than not having two-factor authentication at all. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=92.4s)]
*  But you can do better. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=96.44000000000001s)]
*  A better option is an authenticator app, like Google Authenticator or my favorite, Authy. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=97.72s)]
*  You link these apps to your account, say in the settings of your Amazon app. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=102.64000000000001s)]
*  It's usually as simple as snapping a photo of a QR code with your phone. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  Then your authenticator app produces a unique numeric code every 30 seconds or so [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=109.64s)]
*  that you have to enter when logging in. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=113.92s)]
*  For most people, this is probably the happy medium. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=115.56s)]
*  It's free, it's still pretty easy to use, and it's relatively secure. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=118.2s)]
*  Use Authy and a good password manager and you're in good shape across the board. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=121.76s)]
*  The most secure answer of the three, and a little more of a hassle, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=125.72s)]
*  is the thing I mentioned at the very beginning, a physical key. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=128.72s)]
*  There's the YubiKey, which comes in lots of different sizes and styles [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=131.84s)]
*  that all do basically the same thing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=134.8s)]
*  And there's the Google Titan key. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=136.44s)]
*  All cost between 20 and 50 bucks. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=137.84s)]
*  There are others too, but one of these is probably the best for you. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=140.36s)]
*  They mostly all work in the same way. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=143.84s)]
*  You set it up in each app just like you would the other two-factor options. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=146.08s)]
*  They're not compatible with everything, but [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  they work with most major social networks and productivity suites. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=150.76s)]
*  Then, next time you enter your username and password, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=154.12s)]
*  it'll prompt you to insert your key. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=156.36s)]
*  On your computer, just stick it in a USB port. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  It works on Mac and Windows and in almost any browser except Safari. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  Phones are a bit more complicated. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=164.16s)]
*  Unfortunately, iPhone users are basically out of luck when it comes to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=165.68s)]
*  using a key to log in, though Ubico, the company that makes the YubiKey, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=169.12s)]
*  says it's working on a product that goes in the iPhone's Lightning port. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=172.84s)]
*  Until then, just stick with a good authenticator app. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=175.8s)]
*  If you use Android, you can either tap it to your phone if it has NFC, or [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=178.44s)]
*  stick it into the USB port. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=181.6s)]
*  If you use this Google Titan key, it can also work over Bluetooth. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=183.28s)]
*  In any case, once you tap the button on the key, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=186.4s)]
*  which confirms there's a human at the machine, it unlocks your account. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=188.52s)]
*  These devices don't send anything other than a cryptographic key, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  basically a thumbs up that you are who you say you are. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=194.72s)]
*  And they'll even verify that you're looking at the real Gmail or Facebook, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=197.48s)]
*  not some fake web page designed to steal your data. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=200.8s)]
*  Obviously, if you lose your key, you might be in trouble. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=204.0s)]
*  Ubico and others do suggest that you get a couple of these keys and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=208.16s)]
*  keep them in different places just in case. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  Otherwise, you'll have to set up a fallback to a text message again, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=215.24s)]
*  which kind of defeats the purpose. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=218.56s)]
*  Just like your house keys, it's good to keep a spare around. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=220.36s)]
*  We're headed for a future with fewer passwords, where the phone or [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=223.08s)]
*  laptop is one factor and your face or thumb is the other. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=225.84s)]
*  So hackers would have to kidnap you to break in. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=228.84s)]
*  But for now, you should set up TwoStep at least on your most important accounts, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=231.24s)]
*  like your email. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=234.84s)]
*  Securing your data like you secure your house is absolutely the least you [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=236.12s)]
*  should do. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wQc3bawHA&t=239.96s)]
