Video Description: Economists say the U.S. would be better off if the country's GDP rose at a 3% rate or more each year, rather than the 2% rate it has been growing at for a while. WSJ explains what GDP is, and why economists are so fixated on its growth. Illustration: Stephanie Swart/The Wall Street Journal

# What GDP Says About the Economy | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 03, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8)
*  Economists, Wall Street traders and the president regularly talk about this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=0.0s)]
*  America's gross domestic product. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=6.0s)]
*  As you can see, it generally rises over time. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=9.0s)]
*  But right now, the president and some others say it's not rising fast enough. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=13.0s)]
*  They say the country will be better off if we can make the GDP rise at a 3% rate or even more each year, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=18.0s)]
*  rather than the 2% rate it had been going at for a while. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=24.0s)]
*  We'll explain why they say the current rate isn't fast enough. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=28.0s)]
*  But first, you have to understand what GDP is and how government statisticians measure it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=31.0s)]
*  To put it simply, GDP is a measure of how much stuff a nation produces with all of the work that it does. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=44.0s)]
*  All of the apples we pick from orchards, the cars we produce in factories, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=50.0s)]
*  the dinners we serve at restaurants, the flights we take from airports, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=54.0s)]
*  the broken legs our doctors fix in hospitals and more. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=58.0s)]
*  GDP is what all of that work adds up to. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=62.0s)]
*  As a nation, we produce an enormous amount of stuff every single year. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=65.0s)]
*  According to the Commerce Department, Americans produced nearly $21 trillion worth of goods and services last year. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=70.0s)]
*  Far more than any other nation, including China. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=77.0s)]
*  $21 trillion. Let's put that big number in perspective. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=81.0s)]
*  If all we did as a nation was make cars, that would be about enough car production [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=85.0s)]
*  to build two giant stacks of car towers to the moon in a single year. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=89.0s)]
*  So how does the government measure all that stuff to come up with GDP? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=94.0s)]
*  The government's method is kind of odd. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=100.0s)]
*  If it's a measure of how much stuff we produce as a nation, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=102.0s)]
*  you might think that government statisticians went around counting all that production up. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=105.0s)]
*  But that's not the way the government does it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=110.0s)]
*  Instead, what the government measures is everything that we consume. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=112.0s)]
*  The thinking goes like this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=116.0s)]
*  What is consumed has to be produced by somebody somewhere. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=118.0s)]
*  If you measure consumption, you can figure out production. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=121.0s)]
*  So here's how statisticians calculate consumption. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=124.0s)]
*  First, they count up everything that's spent by consumers. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=128.0s)]
*  That's the stuff you buy from day to day. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=131.0s)]
*  Then, they add it to everything that's spent by businesses on investment. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=134.0s)]
*  That's the stuff businesses buy to grow and make what you're producing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=138.0s)]
*  And then, they add that to everything that's spent by the government [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=142.0s)]
*  on space travel, housing, the military, and everything else. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=145.0s)]
*  Altogether, that equals their broad measure of everything we consume as a nation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=150.0s)]
*  The formula is C plus I plus G. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=155.0s)]
*  Then, the statisticians make some adjustments. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=158.0s)]
*  Sometimes we make goods or provide services that get sent overseas. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=162.0s)]
*  For example, America exports a lot of soybeans. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=166.0s)]
*  That counts toward production too. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=169.0s)]
*  So we add that to the mix. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=171.0s)]
*  Sometimes we also consume products that we've imported. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=174.0s)]
*  Think about your iPhones and televisions imported from China. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=177.0s)]
*  That's the stuff we consume that wasn't made here in America. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=180.0s)]
*  Subtract that from the mix. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=183.0s)]
*  Now, there's two other adjustments to make. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=185.0s)]
*  Sometimes we consume stuff that was made earlier [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=188.0s)]
*  and placed in a warehouse or stuck on the shelf of a store. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=190.0s)]
*  Think about a blouse that was placed in inventory months ago [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=193.0s)]
*  that somebody buys today. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=196.0s)]
*  That's something we might consume today that was produced before. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=198.0s)]
*  To adjust for these timing changes, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=201.0s)]
*  the statisticians correct for changes in inventories. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=203.0s)]
*  They also correct for inflation. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=206.0s)]
*  Prices of stuff tend to go up over time, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=208.0s)]
*  and statisticians adjust for those changes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=211.0s)]
*  Taken altogether, you get GDP. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=214.0s)]
*  So, what's going on now? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=217.0s)]
*  President Trump is worried that GDP isn't growing fast enough. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=221.0s)]
*  Between 1950 and 2000, GDP grew by 3.7% per year. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=224.0s)]
*  That means if we produced 1,000 cars in one year, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=229.0s)]
*  we produced 1,037 the next year and 1,075 the year after that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=232.0s)]
*  Since 2000, GDP has grown by 2% a year. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=238.0s)]
*  That would mean 1,020 cars in the second year [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=242.0s)]
*  and 1,040 in the year after that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=245.0s)]
*  Changes in the growth rate can really add up over time. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=248.0s)]
*  At a 3.7% growth rate, GDP doubles in 20 years. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=251.0s)]
*  At a 2% growth rate, it takes 35 years to double. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=256.0s)]
*  That's a long time to wait for more growth. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=260.0s)]
*  Slower GDP growth means slower growth in family incomes, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=263.0s)]
*  business profits, wealth and prosperity too. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=266.0s)]
*  That's why the president and others worry when GDP doesn't grow fast. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=269.0s)]
*  So, how can we make it grow faster? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=274.0s)]
*  Remember, GDP is a measure of how much our workers produce. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=277.0s)]
*  Two ways to make GDP grow faster are to add more workers to the labor force [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=281.0s)]
*  or to increase the productivity of the ones we've already got. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=285.0s)]
*  Would that make us better off as a nation? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=289.0s)]
*  Well, it would probably help a lot. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=291.0s)]
*  But GDP isn't everything. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=294.0s)]
*  It doesn't tell you how the income an economy produces [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=296.0s)]
*  is distributed between rich and poor. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=299.0s)]
*  It doesn't tell you whether your air and water are clean. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=301.0s)]
*  And it also doesn't tell you whether people are happy producing all of that stuff. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=304.0s)]
*  That's why we need to look at a lot more than GDP [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=308.0s)]
*  to know if we're getting better off as a nation. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oAp8gs9v8&t=311.0s)]
