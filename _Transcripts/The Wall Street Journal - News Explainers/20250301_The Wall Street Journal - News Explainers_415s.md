*  Your country is in big trouble. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=0.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=1.84s)]
*  You're not winning. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=2.56s)]
*  You're not winning this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=3.52s)]
*  Long simmering tensions between President Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=5.2s)]
*  spilled into public view during a meeting at the White House. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=10.24s)]
*  Don't tell us what we're going to feel. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=13.68s)]
*  This visit that really put the whole relationship off-kilter [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=15.44s)]
*  was preceded by a series of humiliations for Zelensky. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=20.16s)]
*  A dictator without elections, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=24.64s)]
*  Zelensky better move faster. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=26.88s)]
*  He's not going to have a country left. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=28.560000000000002s)]
*  NATO you can forget about. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=30.48s)]
*  From a 2019 phone call with Zelensky that led to Trump's first impeachment [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=32.32s)]
*  to blaming Ukraine for Russia's invasion, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=36.8s)]
*  here's how Trump's personal relationship with Zelensky [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=39.84s)]
*  could play a role in determining the future of the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=42.96s)]
*  In April of 2019, Zelensky was elected president of Ukraine, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=48.96s)]
*  and Trump, then in his first term, congratulated him over the phone. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=53.12s)]
*  Shortly after that call, Trump ally Rudy Giuliani began pressuring Zelensky [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  to investigate Trump's political rival. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=62.08s)]
*  I think it gets some interesting information about Joe Biden from Ukraine. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=64.8s)]
*  But when his efforts didn't bear fruit, he more directly said, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=70.08s)]
*  The president is surrounded by people who are enemies of the president [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=73.6s)]
*  and people who are, in least one case, clearly corrupt and involved in this scheme. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=77.52s)]
*  And it's really a shame. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=82.08s)]
*  That really set off this firestorm that culminated in President Trump [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  calling Zelensky, asking for a quarter-quarter favor, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=88.88s)]
*  and then at the same time suspending vital American military assistance to Ukraine, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=92.48s)]
*  which already was facing combat with Russian troops in the eastern Donbas region. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=97.2s)]
*  Let's not forget that the war in Ukraine began in 2014. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=101.44s)]
*  According to a rough transcript from the White House of Trump's July phone call with Zelensky, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=105.28s)]
*  he asked Zelensky to look into his 2020 political opponent, Joe Biden, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=110.32s)]
*  and his son Hunter, and urged the Ukrainian leader several times [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=114.55999999999999s)]
*  to work with Giuliani and former Attorney General Bill Barr. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=118.8s)]
*  That phone call went on to become the subject of Trump's impeachment. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=122.63999999999999s)]
*  The president of Ukraine brought up his country's need for military assistance, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=126.56s)]
*  and immediately thereafter, the president of the United States said, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=131.28s)]
*  I have a favor I want to ask of you, and would not let this subject go. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=134.56s)]
*  Trump denied wrongdoing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=140.56s)]
*  President Zelensky, have you felt any pressure from President Trump to investigate Joe Biden [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  and Hunter Biden? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  I think you read everything. We spoke about many things, and I, so I think, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=148.88s)]
*  and you read it that nobody pushed it, pushed me, yes. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  In other words, no pressure. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  On December 18, 2019, the House impeached Trump for his dealings with Ukraine. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=163.12s)]
*  The impeachment was one of the most traumatic moments of the Trump presidency, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=168.16s)]
*  and perhaps the reason why he lost the 2020 election. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=172.64s)]
*  So in a way, he never forgave Zelensky for that episode. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=176.24s)]
*  Publicly, Trump and Zelensky managed to keep a polite, if tense, relationship. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=180.72s)]
*  But as Trump campaigned in 2024, he pledged to end the war quickly. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=185.92s)]
*  And the relationship took a turn after his inauguration, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=190.96s)]
*  as Trump sought warmer relations with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=194.24s)]
*  No, we had a great call, and it lasted for a long time, over an hour. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=198.88s)]
*  In early February, Trump and Putin pledged to work together to end the war, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=205.84s)]
*  marking a softening in U.S. policy toward Moscow. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=210.4s)]
*  And Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth took Ukraine's hope of joining NATO [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=213.92s)]
*  off the table before negotiations even began. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=217.92s)]
*  The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=221.6s)]
*  realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=227.52s)]
*  It's clear that the Trump administration is interested in opening up to Russia, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=230.72s)]
*  perhaps removing sanctions and developing economic ties. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=236.88s)]
*  And Ukraine is being treated as an obstacle to that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  All this led Zelensky to accuse Trump of living in a Russian disinformation space. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=246.88s)]
*  And then Trump fired back by calling Zelensky a dictator. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  Zelensky's visit to Washington on February 28th gave the leaders a chance to reset. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=257.52s)]
*  They were supposed to sign a mineral deal, which would have been a win-win [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=263.35999999999996s)]
*  situation for both parties, allowing Trump to say he had negotiated return [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=266.56s)]
*  payment on the roughly $120 billion in U.S. aid to Kiev and giving Zelensky [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  a commitment of continued American backing. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=275.28s)]
*  But in the Oval Office, that plan got derailed. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=278.56s)]
*  What makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=282.08s)]
*  That's what President Trump is doing. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=286.24s)]
*  Zelensky interjected, laying out Putin's history of breaking diplomatic promises [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=288.32s)]
*  and his years-long campaign to occupy Ukraine. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=293.12s)]
*  He broke this ceasefire. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=295.76s)]
*  He killed our people and he didn't exchange prisoners. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=297.68s)]
*  We signed the exchange of prisoners, but he didn't do it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=301.44s)]
*  What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=305.76s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=311.12s)]
*  Yes, but if you are not— [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=314.72s)]
*  Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=316.08s)]
*  and try to litigate this in front of the American media. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=319.84s)]
*  You don't have the cards right now. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=322.08s)]
*  With us, you start having cards. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  Right now, you don't have your playing cards. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm wearing a seat. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=327.91999999999996s)]
*  You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=329.68s)]
*  You're gambling with World War III. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  You're gambling with World War III. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=335.28s)]
*  And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=338.24s)]
*  Mr. President, is there no deal? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=343.84s)]
*  After Zelensky and his team departed the White House, Trump said... [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=346.56s)]
*  This is a man that wants to get us signed up and keep fighting. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=350.08s)]
*  And we're not doing that, not for this country. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=354.56s)]
*  The fallout sent shockwaves around the world and raised questions about the prospect for peace. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=357.2s)]
*  Can Ukraine win this war or hold off Russia without continued U.S. support? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=363.2s)]
*  It will be difficult for us. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=369.67999999999995s)]
*  That's why I'm here. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=371.44s)]
*  That's why we speak about the future negotiations. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=373.04s)]
*  It will be difficult without your support. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=376.56s)]
*  But we can't lose. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=379.2s)]
*  I think Zelensky learned a lesson. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=381.12s)]
*  One of the words became a pawn in American domestic politics. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  That memory also guides his resistance now and his unwillingness. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=386.56s)]
*  He treated it as hired help. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=391.28s)]
*  And so that's why he stood up during this meeting in the Oval Office [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=393.36s)]
*  and kept insisting that Ukraine has its own red lines, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=396.8s)]
*  that it's not willing to abandon. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=400.32s)]
*  And you can't just be told what to do. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=402.32s)]
*  It's up to Ukraine to show you that it does have a conscience. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=404.24s)]
*  And it's up to its allies in Europe and elsewhere to give Ukraine its cards. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y&t=406.71999999999997s)]
