# Tech Companies Depend on China for Rare Earths. Can That Change?  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 04, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE)
*  For the wheels of a Tesla to spin or sound to come out of your iPhone, they all require [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=0.0s)]
*  a tiny piece of metal called neodymium. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  It helps turn electricity into motion, and it's one of 17 important minerals called [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=8.36s)]
*  rare earths, which are in many of the electronics we use every day. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=12.6s)]
*  But now, your tech could be under threat. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=16.36s)]
*  The fundamental challenge is the complete and total dominance of China. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=18.64s)]
*  In the past few years, 80% of US rare earth imports have come from China. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=22.84s)]
*  And that's an issue because of concerns that Beijing could cut off access to the US. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=27.64s)]
*  There's going to be a need for many more rare earths, and on a much more secure basis [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=31.92s)]
*  than the presently politically charged Chinese monopoly. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=37.24s)]
*  So the US and its allies are building their own supply chain. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=40.56s)]
*  We're going to be producing at least 50% more than we do today. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=43.4s)]
*  We follow the new players in the neodymium supply chain as they seek to break China's monopoly. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=48.64s)]
*  To understand how China got so big, let's rewind about 30 years. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=53.44s)]
*  It all started with Deng Xiaoping, China's leader back then. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=62.04s)]
*  Deng Xiaoping is reported to have said that Saudi Arabia has oil, but China has rare earths. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=65.6s)]
*  Jeffrey Wilson is the research director at the Think Tank Perth US Asia Center, which [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=72.84s)]
*  is partly funded by the Australian government. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=77.36s)]
*  He's been watching China's rare earth policies for the past decade. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=80.12s)]
*  The Chinese government started developing the rare earth sector as a strategic national [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=83.4s)]
*  industry in the late 1980s. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  And that was built on a recognition that rare earths would be really critical to a number [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=90.12s)]
*  of the technology sectors that were emerging. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=94.28s)]
*  With that foresight, Beijing rolled out tax rebates and subsidies that helped the industry [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=98.2s)]
*  flourish. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  By the end of the millennium, the country became all-dominant and could influence global [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  prices. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  And since in 2010, it cut export quotas that caused the price of some rare earths to surge [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=109.08s)]
*  tenfold. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=113.8s)]
*  And China's control over the industry was a geopolitical tool during the trade war with [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=115.12s)]
*  the US. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=119.2s)]
*  China has been taking advantage of the United States for many, many years. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=120.2s)]
*  When the Trump administration threatened to cut off supplies of chips and processors to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=124.12s)]
*  telecom giant Huawei, Beijing said it was a threat to its national sovereignty and warned [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=127.72s)]
*  that it could stop the export of rare earth materials to the US. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=133.04s)]
*  The Chinese government didn't pull the trigger, but as tensions escalated, some companies [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=136.52s)]
*  decided to take action. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=148.72s)]
*  Here we have one of the richest known deposits in the world. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=150.44s)]
*  This is the first stop in an alternative neodymium supply chain, Mount Weld, in Western Australia, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  where Amanda Lacaz's mining company digs rare earths out of the ground. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  It was once a volcano, and there are rare earths found throughout that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=164.44s)]
*  And this shows the tiny little bit that we have actually mined at this stage. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=169.8s)]
*  Lacaz runs Linus, the largest rare earth producing miner outside of China. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  She says these minerals are actually not that hard to find, but the difficulty is turning [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=180.24s)]
*  them into something usable. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  The rare earths actually come out of the ground, and they're all married together. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=186.72s)]
*  And then we put it through our concentrator so that by the time it leaves here, about [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=192.0s)]
*  35 percent of the material is rare earths. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=197.6s)]
*  Lacaz has been trying to extract more from these rocks because recently she says companies [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=201.12s)]
*  have told her they want to buy more. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=206.52s)]
*  So to keep pace with growing demand, Linus is expanding. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=208.8s)]
*  This is the new plant we're going to build. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=212.84s)]
*  Linus raised about $330 million last August to upgrade processing facilities. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=215.12s)]
*  On the same time, the company won a U.S. Department of Defense contract to build a new plant [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=221.32s)]
*  in Texas. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=226.04s)]
*  It would process rare earths needed to produce military weapons and electronics. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=227.32s)]
*  Once these expansions are finished, industry analysts expect Linus to produce a quarter [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=231.92s)]
*  of the world's concentrated rare earths. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  But neodymium still has a long way to travel after Australia, and before it ends up in [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  your phone. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=243.56s)]
*  These rocks typically have five more steps to go, where they have to be processed and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=245.12s)]
*  turned into metals. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  Like at this facility in the UK. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=250.6s)]
*  So this is a sample of neodymium metal that's melted together with iron and boron and some [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=257.04s)]
*  other additives to make the alloy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=263.8s)]
*  Ian Higgins is the managing director of Less Common Metals near Liverpool. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=266.76s)]
*  Industry experts say the company is one of the few outside of Asia that can turn the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=271.4s)]
*  rocks into metal pieces. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=274.68s)]
*  And some of these go directly to tech companies, automakers or end up in Formula One cars. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=276.52s)]
*  Higgins didn't immediately begin selling neodymium metals to big companies. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=283.08s)]
*  When he started his new operation in 2017, he turned to industry leaders for advice. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=287.12s)]
*  So the kind of business model we're putting together would involve essentially copying [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=292.64s)]
*  the Chinese. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=296.64s)]
*  He purchased machines from China and before the pandemic was visiting Chinese plants up [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=298.32s)]
*  to three times a year. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=302.84s)]
*  Today, he's honed the technique and even automated some of the process. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=304.76000000000005s)]
*  But his metals still aren't cheaper than China's. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=308.48s)]
*  Higgins says the price of Western neodymium products are around 20 to 25 percent more [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=311.48s)]
*  expensive. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=316.0s)]
*  And one big reason is a challenge that all rare earth producers face. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=318.8s)]
*  Pollution. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=322.76000000000005s)]
*  Linus refines its neodymium at a processing plant in Malaysia, which releases a type of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=323.76000000000005s)]
*  radioactive residue. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=328.44000000000005s)]
*  After protests from the local community, Linus said it plans to use part of the $330 million [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=330.0s)]
*  in expansion funds to move back some of the polluting work to Australia. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=338.84s)]
*  Wilson says environmental regulations in China are looser and this has helped domestic rare [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=344.16s)]
*  earth companies stay competitive. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=349.08s)]
*  For example, China produces heavy rare earths using a technique called in situ leaching, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=351.44s)]
*  where acid is poured directly into the ground. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=356.72s)]
*  This is a mining technique that is practically unusable due to its environmental costs in [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=359.04s)]
*  most Western countries. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=364.32s)]
*  Over the years, Beijing has said it's taking measures to protect the environment and encouraging [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=367.16s)]
*  rare earth enterprises to use efficient and green technologies. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=371.56s)]
*  This palace represents different grade of rare earths. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=375.88s)]
*  For the Western supply chain, Lacasse says sustainability will be key. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=382.04s)]
*  The whole ecosystem in which we're involved is ending up with products which are sold [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=386.36s)]
*  on the basis that they're good for the environment. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=392.48s)]
*  Well that is absolutely no good if we trash the environment along the way. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=395.36s)]
*  And it's still a long way for this new supply chain, especially as it tries to catch up [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=400.32s)]
*  with China's three decades worth of investments. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=404.44s)]
*  For instance, in order for the West to produce 2,000 tons of magnets a year, which is enough [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  for one million cars, Higgin says one option would be to open a new mine and that would [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=411.8s)]
*  cost up to $1 billion. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=416.84000000000003s)]
*  So he suggests taking a page from Beijing's book. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=419.40000000000003s)]
*  They enjoy extensive amounts of state support, subsidies, tax rebates. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=422.6s)]
*  The help of government is absolutely essential to allow this coordination to take place. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=427.52000000000004s)]
*  Government support is starting to come in. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=434.64s)]
*  Last year, the Trump administration's pandemic aid package included $800 million to fund [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=436.48s)]
*  rare earth research. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=441.64s)]
*  The Biden administration also said it's reviewing the supply chain to protect U.S. interests. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=444.91999999999996s)]
*  Allies are also on the move. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=450.4s)]
*  Last year, the European Union kickstarted a $12 billion investment program for rare [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=452.28s)]
*  earth and green energy projects. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=456.84s)]
*  Higgins and Lacasse aren't alone in their supply chain efforts. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=459.28s)]
*  We have this incredible mission, which is to restore the rare earth supply chain back [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  to the Western hemisphere. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=467.71999999999997s)]
*  Other companies are opening or expanding mines and processing facilities in various [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=469.44s)]
*  places like the U.S., Australia and Tanzania. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=473.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, some tech companies have expressed concerns over how rare earths are sourced. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=476.48s)]
*  Apple said it's transitioning to recycled rare earth elements, which are already in [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=481.68s)]
*  several of its products. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=485.96s)]
*  For now, the new players are ready to make change. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=489.0s)]
*  Europe, the UK, North America and Australia, we need to collaborate. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=491.48s)]
*  We're looking forward to really reboot the rare earth supply chain. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7pusAWBCoE&t=495.56s)]
