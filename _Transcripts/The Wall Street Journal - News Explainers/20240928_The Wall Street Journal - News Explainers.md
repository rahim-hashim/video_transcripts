*  Here's how the conflict escalated. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=56.44s)]
*  Israel and Hezbollah began trading fire in October, after the Hamas-led attack on Israel [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=61.12s)]
*  sparked a war in Gaza. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=66.16s)]
*  Like Hamas, Hezbollah, designated by the U.S. as a terrorist group, are closely aligned [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=70.68s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=76.12s)]
*  The Lebanese militant group said its attacks on Israel were in support of Palestine and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=77.48s)]
*  vowed to continue until a ceasefire was reached in Gaza. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=82.12s)]
*  Hostilities had been largely contained to areas near the border, destroying towns and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=87.12s)]
*  displacing tens of thousands on both sides. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=91.72s)]
*  As tensions grew, the U.S. and the international community pushed for diplomatic solutions. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=95.68s)]
*  But Israel and Hezbollah continued to exchange fire daily. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=101.36000000000001s)]
*  Israel conducted a number of high-profile intelligence operations, including the targeted [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=107.0s)]
*  killing of Hezbollah commanders. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=111.68s)]
*  Initially, both sides seemed reluctant to escalate into a bigger conflict. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  But tensions boiled over in September, when pagers and walkie-talkies issued to Hezbollah [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=121.4s)]
*  members simultaneously exploded across the country. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=125.84s)]
*  More than 30 people were killed over two days, and thousands were injured. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=130.76000000000002s)]
*  Hezbollah blamed Israel for the attacks. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=135.36s)]
*  Israeli authorities did not publicly comment on the pager attacks, but the country's [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=141.68s)]
*  defense minister said Israel was starting a new phase of the war in the north. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  Israel then carried out waves of airstrikes across Lebanon over nearly two weeks, killing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=156.12s)]
*  hundreds, including a number of Hezbollah commanders, and called on civilians to evacuate [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=161.4s)]
*  their homes. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  The strike on September 27th was Israel's most aggressive move in weeks of elaborate [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=170.0s)]
*  intelligence operations, targeted killings, and heavy bombardments, aimed at stopping [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=174.48s)]
*  Hezbollah from attacking across the Lebanese border into Israel. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=179.68s)]
*  After the strike, Israel claimed Nasrallah was dead, killed in that massive airstrike. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=184.72s)]
*  Senior officials from Hezbollah and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were also [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=191.12s)]
*  at the site, people familiar with the matter said. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=195.54s)]

*  Israel targeted earlier in the week. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=204.48s)]

*  It started after Hezbollah ambushed an Israeli military patrol during a cross-border raid, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=214.72s)]
*  killing two soldiers and capturing others. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=220.0s)]
*  Israel retaliated with overwhelming force. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  The bombardment killed around 1,000 Lebanese civilians and damaged infrastructure. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=227.4s)]
*  But it did limited damage to Hezbollah. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=232.88s)]
*  Despite its overwhelming power, Israel reached the brink of military disaster after it launched [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=236.12s)]
*  a ground invasion of southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah was able to use guerrilla tactics [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=241.0s)]
*  to inflict significant casualties on Israeli forces. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=246.12s)]
*  Experts say Nasrallah's death is an enormous blow not only to the group he led, but also [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=251.0s)]
*  to its main backer, Iran, and its wider network of aligned militias in the Middle East. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=255.38s)]
*  Israel hoped his death could significantly degrade Hezbollah and head off the need for [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=261.5s)]
*  a ground invasion into Lebanon. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1uuu29jeU&t=265.58s)]
