# What the Texas Abortion Pill Ruling Means for Abortion Access | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc)
*  A drug used in medication abortions, the most common method to end a pregnancy, is at the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=0.0s)]
*  center of the latest legal battle over abortion access. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=5.0s)]
*  Federal judges in Texas and Washington issued decisions that appear directly at odds with [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  one another. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=13.4s)]
*  One suspends approval of the drug Mifepristone by the Food and Drug Administration. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=14.56s)]
*  The other prevents the FDA from restricting access to the drug in some states. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=18.88s)]
*  Laura Casisto is a National Legal Affairs reporter and leads abortion coverage for the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=23.72s)]
*  Journal. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=27.92s)]
*  She explains what the decisions mean and what comes next. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=28.92s)]
*  A Texas judge said that the FDA had improperly approved a drug known as Mifepristone. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=31.6s)]
*  He suspended that approval, saying that the FDA hadn't adequately considered the safety [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  of the drug. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  They'd used the wrong procedure for approving the drug. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=45.160000000000004s)]
*  The FDA had approved the drug under a pathway that's used to approve drugs to treat life-threatening [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=47.56s)]
*  illnesses. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=52.32000000000001s)]
*  And the judge said most of us would not understand pregnancy to be a serious life-threatening [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=53.32000000000001s)]
*  illness. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=56.8s)]
*  He also said that the FDA had not adequately taken into account possible concerns about [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=57.8s)]
*  hemorrhage, about infection, about mental trauma that women could suffer. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=62.44s)]
*  So this ruling is really significant because it affects abortion access not just in Texas, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  but around the country. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=72.2s)]
*  If the judge's ruling does go into effect, that would mean that the pill could be pulled [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=73.28s)]
*  from the market. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=76.64s)]
*  And so this is really kind of one of the first developments we've seen that has potential [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=77.64s)]
*  nationwide significance since Roe v. Wade was overturned. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=81.0s)]
*  It's completely out of bounds what the judge did. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=84.12s)]
*  Journalists and lawyers were all still digesting this really kind of blockbuster ruling out [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=87.64s)]
*  of Texas. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=92.36s)]
*  And we got this other really quite unexpected ruling from a judge in Washington state. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=93.36s)]
*  It appears the judge there is saying that the FDA can't take additional action at the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=97.6s)]
*  moment to further constrain access to the abortion pill. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  Now that ruling only applies in states that were parties in the lawsuit. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=106.96s)]
*  But in those states, there's like a real tension between the rulings of these two judges. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=110.44s)]
*  There's a concern that this could really destabilize the drug approval process in general [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=115.0s)]
*  if you have judges potentially second guessing the FDA. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=119.68s)]
*  What I will say as a caveat to that is that, you know, this is abortion. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=122.88s)]
*  This is not a typical drug, an uncontroversial drug. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=127.16s)]
*  This is something that has been at the center of a political firestorm in this country for [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=131.36s)]
*  five decades. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=135.76s)]
*  It's not a perfect analogy for other drugs. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=137.12s)]
*  It is contrary to what makes for good public health policy to allow courts and politicians [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=140.24s)]
*  to tell the FDA what it should do. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  The Biden administration moved quickly to appeal the ruling. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  They filed something with the Fifth Circuit, the Court of Appeals, asking for them to stay [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  the ruling. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=158.8s)]
*  And they've asked for them to make a decision by Thursday. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=159.8s)]
*  That could go one of two ways. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  They can give the Biden administration what they want. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  They can put this ruling on hold. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=166.52s)]
*  Or they can not. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  They can allow it to go into effect. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=170.14s)]
*  And then in that instance, I think you're very likely going to see the Biden administration [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=171.7s)]
*  turn around very quickly and file an appeal with the Supreme Court. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=175.7s)]
*  We stand by the FDA's approval of Miffl-Preston and we are prepared for a long legal fight. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ShSdPFzpc&t=179.5s)]
