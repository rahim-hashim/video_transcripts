# How the U.S. Government Obtains and Uses Cellphone Location Data | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 10, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo)
*  You're probably aware that different apps on your cell phone can track your movements. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=0.0s)]
*  That location data is commercially available along with other personal information like [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  your social media profile, email address and date of birth. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=9.84s)]
*  But what the Wall Street Journal has learned is that the government has also bought that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=13.52s)]
*  commercial data and is using it for some forms of law enforcement. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=17.36s)]
*  Two components of the Department of Homeland Security are using this app-generated marketing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=22.2s)]
*  data for law enforcement purposes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=27.02s)]
*  The fact that there are millions of cell phones and cell phone locations in this database [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  makes it one of the larger domestic surveillance efforts that we've become aware of in recent years. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=34.32s)]
*  It raises a lot of questions among Americans about their privacy and what kind of information [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=39.6s)]
*  corporations are collecting on them and what those corporations are doing with that information. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=44.32s)]
*  This is how it works. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=49.96s)]
*  You get this pop-up and agree to let an app use your location. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=51.36s)]
*  A travel app may want it to suggest nearby hotels or airports. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=54.88s)]
*  Rideshare apps want to know where to pick you up. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  But often those apps are also sharing your location with marketers, who are using it [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=61.52s)]
*  for targeted ads, research, analysis and even reselling it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=65.56s)]
*  But what we've found is that in some cases that consumer data is being resold to companies [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=69.64s)]
*  that buy and sell data for the government. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=74.56s)]
*  According to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=77.64s)]
*  the Trump administration has purchased a database that maps the movements of millions of cell [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  phones in the US and is using it for immigration and border enforcement. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  In 2018, data tracking contributed to the discovery of a drug-smuggling tunnel, according [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  to people with knowledge of the operation. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=98.52s)]
*  Sources describe this one case down in Arizona, a border town called San Luis, where a man [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  had allegedly built a tunnel between his property, which was an abandoned KFC restaurant, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=106.6s)]
*  and the Mexican border. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=113.08s)]
*  Police say that smugglers were using this tunnel. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=114.55999999999999s)]
*  But the interesting thing is, when this person was arrested, none of the court records indicate [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=116.83999999999999s)]
*  that they found this tunnel based on cell records. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  This data was showing cell phones moving from one side of the border to the other, and investigators [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  surmised there must be an illegal tunnel there and began further investigations that led [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=130.54s)]
*  to the arrest of this person. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=134.92s)]
*  In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, a CBP spokesman said, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=136.4s)]
*  The government would not discuss details about how it is using the data, but people familiar [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  with some of the government's efforts say it is used to generate investigative leads [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=159.08s)]
*  about possible illegal border crossings and for detection or tracking of migrant groups. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=163.02s)]
*  The government's location data efforts are also described opaquely in the US Department [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  of Homeland Security's privacy assessment. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=173.9s)]
*  One reads, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=176.82000000000002s)]
*  The marketing technology ecosystem has taken off in recent years. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=193.02s)]
*  Marketers create audiences based on rich device-level attributes including location, platform, device [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=207.34s)]
*  type and app affinity. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=212.34s)]
*  It's big business and there are many companies collecting all sorts of different data. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=220.22s)]
*  Anything from the speed you are travelling to what floor you're on, to your social media [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=225.58s)]
*  profiles. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=229.86s)]
*  Some companies, known as data brokers, buy different sets of this data and combine them [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=230.86s)]
*  to create even more sophisticated individual digital profiles. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=235.5s)]
*  While the privacy policies of these companies say they do not keep personal information [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=240.02s)]
*  and explain that to them you were just a few letters or numbers, known as an ad ID, experts [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=244.46s)]
*  we spoke to say that by using large data sets it's easy to figure out who a phone belongs [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=249.74s)]
*  to, which is one of the reasons why this data is so valuable to the government. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=255.46s)]
*  I think location data is some of the most sensitive data that exists. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=260.18s)]
*  Alan Butler is the General Counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a non-profit [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=263.98s)]
*  research and advocacy center based in DC. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=269.38s)]
*  There are a number of different ways that a company that obtains these data sets could [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=272.98s)]
*  identify a person. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=277.14s)]
*  One way might be by mapping the locations over time because people live and operate [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=279.0s)]
*  in patterns. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=284.9s)]
*  The companies are more concerned with discrete connections. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=285.9s)]
*  They want to tie everything together in an automated way and the easiest way for them [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=289.2s)]
*  to do that is by using identifiers. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=292.94s)]
*  The ad ID, which is going to connect the dots, all the dots of the mobile ad data, but also [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=295.0s)]
*  email addresses, Facebook profiles or Twitter profiles or other sort of app profile data. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=300.46s)]
*  And so the more data those companies can get about you, the more they can connect it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=307.3s)]
*  If the government wanted to get that kind of data from your cell phone provider, they'd [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=312.36s)]
*  have to get a warrant from a judge. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  But because this data is for sale from marketers, they are able to buy it and access it without [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=318.34000000000003s)]
*  a warrant. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=323.48s)]
*  Most recently the Supreme Court in the Carpenter v. United States case restricted the government's [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=324.48s)]
*  ability to use a court order to get commercial data from the phone company, which is the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=329.44s)]
*  data about where your phone is connecting on the cell phone network. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=334.52s)]
*  The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the purchasing of commercial data. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=337.65999999999997s)]
*  The federal law does impose restrictions and the circumstances under which the federal [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  government can collect personal data under the Privacy Act. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=347.09999999999997s)]
*  But that also can be tricky if the company never actually stores the data in a government [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=351.02s)]
*  database. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=356.38s)]
*  Recently, some companies have taken steps to alert users about location data. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=357.38s)]
*  This market advertising data on smartphones is barely 10 years old. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=362.4s)]
*  And already we're seeing that consumers are taking more control over their privacy in [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=366.7s)]
*  ways that could really hurt this industry. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=372.18s)]
*  Apple in its latest update made it so that it reminded users how often apps are tracking [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=375.6s)]
*  them. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=381.64s)]
*  And some industry insiders have said that the amount of location data has plummeted [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=382.64s)]
*  since Apple made that change. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=387.76s)]
*  Users are becoming broadly much more aware of how their phones are tracking them and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=389.84s)]
*  taking steps to limit what kind of apps have access to their location. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=393.09999999999997s)]
*  Critics argue that if companies have this data, then why shouldn't the government also [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=397.9s)]
*  have access to it for crime prevention? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=401.79999999999995s)]
*  I think the reaction that law enforcement should be able to get access to data that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=404.21999999999997s)]
*  companies have access to kind of falls into two common traps. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=407.9s)]
*  One is that it assumes that the company should have access to that data too. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=411.97999999999996s)]
*  But even given the fact that some companies have access to the data, I think law enforcement [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=415.53999999999996s)]
*  use of the data is just a fundamentally different thing because the government exercises the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=419.36s)]
*  power of the state and so we've always had a special set of rules for the government's [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=423.44s)]
*  collection of data and surveillance of individuals. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=428.24s)]
*  Right now there is no comprehensive US privacy law. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=431.32s)]
*  The European Union in 2016 passed the General Data Protection Regulation, which more tightly [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=434.44s)]
*  controls how European data can be used. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=440.68s)]
*  In the US there are ongoing efforts to introduce tougher national privacy laws in Congress. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=443.52s)]
*  Programs like this are certainly going to fuel the call for a comprehensive privacy [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=449.16s)]
*  law in the United States that limits the way corporations can share data that they collect [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=452.90000000000003s)]
*  on users. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=458.70000000000005s)]
*  California has taken some steps towards passing some greater privacy protections, but federally [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=459.70000000000005s)]
*  there's no law that stops or limits what corporations can do with the data they collect on their [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=464.58000000000004s)]
*  users in this particular market. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=472.38s)]
*  That's how it ended up in the hands of the government. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXAShotdFZo&t=474.78000000000003s)]
