# The $1.6 Billion Dominion v. Fox News Trial, Explained  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ)
*  A massive and coordinated effort to steal this election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Electoral fraud that would be perpetrated through electronic voting. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=3.44s)]
*  They used the machines to trash large batches of votes. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Claims like these are at the center of a $1.6 billion defamation case against Fox News. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=11.44s)]
*  Dominion Voting Systems sued the broadcaster in 2021 over alleged defamatory on-air comments [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  that tied the company's voting machines to false claims of election fraud in 2020. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=23.52s)]
*  This case really examines that line between what is journalism and what should be protected [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=27.96s)]
*  and what shouldn't be. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=33.6s)]
*  From internal text messages to high-profile depositions, here's what you need to know about the case. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  During the 2020 presidential election, voting machine maker Dominion had contracts in 28 states. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=42.32s)]
*  And after former President Donald Trump lost, Fox had his associates on broadcasts. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=48.24s)]
*  Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani claiming that Dominion rigged the election in favor of President Joe Biden. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=52.96s)]
*  Federal and state officials have said there is no evidence that any voting system deleted [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=60.08s)]
*  or changed votes during the 2020 election. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=64.44s)]
*  The company argues that by airing those claims, Fox News gave them prominence, even though they were false. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=67.0s)]
*  Fox says that it was reporting on newsworthy claims from a sitting president and his associates [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=72.68s)]
*  that other media outlets also covered. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=77.28s)]
*  Dominion's main argument is that Fox News knowingly broadcast false claims about its machines [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=79.44000000000001s)]
*  because it had a financial incentive to do so. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  Fox has denied that allegation. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=87.04s)]
*  Many executives in a lot of these email communications were expressing a lot of angst about losing viewership. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  So Dominion alleges that Fox leaned into the false claims to keep its viewers. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=96.28s)]
*  In released court filings, Dominion says that internal communications among Fox hosts and staff [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=100.56s)]
*  proved that Fox knew the claims were false. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  Like a text message from Tucker Carlson to his producer, which said, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=108.96s)]
*  Sidney Powell is lying. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=112.28s)]
*  And another one he sent to Laura Ingraham that said, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  It's unbelievably offensive to me. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  Our viewers are good people and they believe it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  And in her deposition, Fox host Maria Bartiromo called an email regarding the election fraud claims from Powell [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=120.56s)]
*  kooky and unreliable. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=126.52s)]
*  But on her show a day after receiving the email, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  Sidney, we talked about the Dominion software. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=130.92s)]
*  I know that there were voting irregularities. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=133.56s)]
*  Tell me about that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=136.68s)]
*  That's to put it mildly, the computer glitches could not and should not have happened in at all. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=139.76s)]
*  That is where the fraud took place, where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=146.72s)]
*  All of these domain will use to say Fox had a disregard for the facts of the case. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=154.28s)]
*  Fox says that its on air hosts didn't make the Dominion election fraud claims themselves. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=161.6s)]
*  Dominion also released a deposition from Fox Corporation Chairman Rupert Murdoch, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  who also owns News Corp, the parent company of the Wall Street Journal. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=171.12s)]
*  He did acknowledge that some of the broadcast did endorse claims of a false election as opposed to simply reporting on them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=174.6s)]
*  And he acknowledged that he could have stopped it from happening. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  Fox says that these quotes were cherry picked from the deposition. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=188.2s)]
*  But those statements on their own, Dominion will try to use to show that executives like Rupert Murdoch had control over these decisions that were made on air. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=191.92s)]
*  The judge said prior to the trial that he would require Murdoch and other Fox Corp executives to testify if Dominion subpoenaed them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=202.0s)]
*  In a statement, Fox said demanding witnesses who had nothing to do with the challenged broadcasts is just the latest example of their political crusade in search of a financial windfall. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  Fox also says the lawsuit is an attack on press freedom. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  The 1964 Supreme Court case, New York Times vs. Sullivan, says that plaintiffs suing for defamation must be able to prove that the publisher had actual malice. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=222.16s)]
*  Which means that you knew that the information was wrong or you had a reckless disregard for the truth in publishing it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=231.32s)]
*  It's a historically high bar to meet. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=237.2s)]
*  And Fox says that Dominion's evidence doesn't clear it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  They say that some of the statements that have been highlighted, text messages expressing doubt or simply cherry picked, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=242.12s)]
*  they believe that the host did express in some extent expressed enough skepticism on air. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=250.96s)]
*  Like here, when Tucker Carlson said he invited Powell to back up her claims with evidence. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  But she never sent us any evidence despite a lot of requests, polite requests, not a page. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=262.92s)]
*  Dominion says that the emails, texts and deposition testimony speak for themselves. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=268.48s)]
*  In late March, Judge Eric Davis ruled the case should go to a jury trial. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=273.44s)]
*  The judge also rejected Fox's arguments that they should be protected by the First Amendment and that they could have a shield for reporting allegations neutrally. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=277.92s)]
*  Fox says that the newsworthiness of the statements at issue are clear and indisputable. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=287.4s)]
*  The judge also said that Dominion had proved that claims the company had rigged the election for Joe Biden were false. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=292.12s)]
*  Days before the trial was set to begin, Judge Davis said he was likely to investigate whether Fox News improperly withheld information during litigation. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=297.52000000000004s)]
*  He also said Fox might face sanctions. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=305.48s)]
*  Fox News said it didn't improperly withhold information from Dominion and produced additional materials when it became aware of them. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  So the trial will likely focus on whether Dominion can prove Fox acted with actual malice and if it suffered financial damages as a result. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  This trial is a rare example of a defamation case making it all the way to trial. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=323.12s)]
*  And it's particularly important because Fox News is a huge name in media and they have a lot of influence. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=329.0s)]
*  And so it'll be in some ways a test of this very difficult standard of defamation. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EBAzYIGRQ&t=335.92s)]
