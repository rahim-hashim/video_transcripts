# Behind Costco's Treasure-Hunt Shopping Strategy  WSJ The Economics Of
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 03, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q)
*  If you've ever shopped at Costco, you may have noticed that it's a little different. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Costco is not engineered for a quick shopping trip. It is exactly the opposite. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=6.0s)]
*  This is the economics of Costco. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=11.0s)]
*  It's not a grocery store. It's not a small corner store. It's huge. It's cavernous. The ceiling is high. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=14.0s)]
*  Goods are literally stacked on pallets up to almost the ceiling. That's all part of the model and the experience. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=21.0s)]
*  I got a Costco haul! First thing we got is a five dozen of eggs, then we got salmon for you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=28.0s)]
*  Unlike most stores, there are no aisle signs or in-store maps to help direct shoppers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=33.0s)]
*  Instead, aisles are simply numbered. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=39.0s)]
*  What's more, Costco constantly moves some of its products and cycles in new products. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=42.0s)]
*  So what gives? Why are Costco's stores designed this way? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=49.0s)]
*  And how has it helped the company grow into the retail behemoth that it is today? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=54.0s)]
*  Costco is a big fan of using treasure hunt retail psychology to draw you in. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=59.0s)]
*  Which is basically having items on the shelf that are at a wow price because they're such a good discount or they're just really interesting and they're not going to be there forever. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=66.0s)]
*  The big idea behind Costco's treasure hunt strategy is that by encouraging customers to explore and ensuring that there's always a new batch of interesting deals, customers end up shopping longer and buying more products. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=77.0s)]
*  Today I went to Costco thinking I was just going to get a few items but I ended up with a whole entire cart. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=91.0s)]
*  When you go into the store it doesn't feel the same as the last time you were there. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=95.0s)]
*  So you have a sense of urgency about purchasing and also just a sense of wanting to come back and check out what's going on. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=98.0s)]
*  If it was the same every time you might not come as often. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=105.0s)]
*  Today Costco is one of the world's largest retailers, boasting over 803 locations and 275,000 employees. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=108.0s)]
*  Costco was part of sort of this early warehouse club concept, which was really about instead of like go to the store, buy a single item, come to the store, pay a membership and maybe you're a small business and we'll offer you wholesale prices, basically lower prices. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=116.0s)]
*  Most members pay an annual fee of $60 for the basic plan. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=132.0s)]
*  But customers can upgrade to the executive membership, which has more perks for $120 a year. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=136.0s)]
*  Membership dues are also how Costco makes most of its money. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=143.0s)]
*  I think Costco's management's main goal is always this ethos of can we offer more exciting items at a better price to keep memberships growing. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=147.0s)]
*  The model is make money on the membership, sell things as cheaply as possible. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=158.0s)]
*  They can't just raise the price on something to increase the profit. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=163.0s)]
*  That's against the internal code. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=166.0s)]
*  And so that also includes things like let's save money in how much time we spend putting products on shelves. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=168.0s)]
*  So that's part of the reason why you see these pallets of goods stacked up to the ceiling is there's not a lot of time spent taking apart those pallets, putting each individual product on the shelf. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=175.0s)]
*  If they eliminate that, there's a little bit of labor savings, there's some time savings because they're just putting all that stuff out on a pallet and you take it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=184.0s)]
*  Costco says that an average item in the store is only marked up 11% compared to the 25 to 50% often seen in retail. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=191.0s)]
*  This commitment to low prices hasn't just kept customers loyal, it has also helped spread the brand. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=200.0s)]
*  There's a psychology to finding a deal that's very satisfying for people. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=207.0s)]
*  And people enjoy the product selection at Costco. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=211.0s)]
*  They have very skilled merchants that usually have been employed there for a very long time and really know what a Costco customer likely would want. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=214.0s)]
*  And they're good at getting good prices on those products. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=222.0s)]
*  I got Premier protein flavored vanilla. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=225.0s)]
*  And that sort of creates a certain frenzy around finding those things. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=228.0s)]
*  I got the Kirkland brand microwave popcorn. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=232.0s)]
*  I got two packs of bottled water. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=235.0s)]
*  Most retailers might assume that shoppers want more choices, not less. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=237.0s)]
*  They sell a limited number of items. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=243.0s)]
*  So that means they have to be pretty precise. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=245.0s)]
*  They think about giving space to a product in their store differently than a Walmart would. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=247.0s)]
*  And if that product doesn't sell, it's out of there. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=252.0s)]
*  It's very cutthroat. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=256.0s)]
*  If you're a product on the shelf, you have to earn your place. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=257.0s)]
*  The average Costco warehouse stocks about 3,700 products at any given time. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=260.0s)]
*  Less than one tenth of most supermarkets, 40 to 50,000 items. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=266.0s)]
*  But even though Costco stocks fewer items, the items they do stock have a reputation. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=271.0s)]
*  I see you've noticed me rolling up the sleeves on my new Kirkland signature quarters that my mother got me for the holidays. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=276.0s)]
*  Kirkland is Costco's private label brand. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=283.0s)]
*  It's their store brand. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=286.0s)]
*  It's a brand that when they want to offer something at a certain price that they don't feel a manufacturer or supplier can do it, they build it themselves. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=287.0s)]
*  Since it was launched in 1995, the in-house brand has built a reputation for quality and low prices on everyday items. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=295.0s)]
*  Today, Kirkland products make up a quarter of Costco's $166 billion in annual sales. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=303.0s)]
*  But when you talk to customers, I think they generally feel that it doesn't necessarily need to be fancy because they've already bought into this Costco pitch, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=311.0s)]
*  which is this is high quality and it's a lower price and you don't need to be afraid of it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=320.0s)]
*  That customer loyalty helped Costco remain strong during the pandemic. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=325.0s)]
*  Costco is certainly a model that has not only survived the pandemic, but has really thrived in the pandemic. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=330.0s)]
*  Despite the increased popularity of online shopping, Costco has leaned into its strategy of driving members to its stores. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=337.0s)]
*  It's really interesting to me because for years people have questioned Costco. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=344.0s)]
*  Amazon's going to get you. You've got to get bigger online. And that really hasn't played out yet. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=348.0s)]
*  They've said explicitly, we prefer people to come into the store and shop. We want impulse buys. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=354.0s)]
*  We want people to come in, see what we have and buy more. We work better that way and it's cheaper. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=358.0s)]
*  You [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHG-TGip3Q&t=366.0s)]
