# What Is France’s ‘Gilets Jaunes’ or ‘Yellow Vests’ Protest Movement?
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 07, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU)
*  Gilets jaunes, or yellow vests, refers to the neon vests that all French drivers must keep in their vehicles for breakdown emergencies. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=0.0s)]
*  But now it's come to symbolise a protest movement, frustrated with French President Emmanuel Macron, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=10.0s)]
*  who they say is disconnected from the day-to-day economic difficulties suffered by workers and retirees like Robert Tichy. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=17.0s)]
*  We are led by, I would almost call it, the Vierminne, who is leading us. It's unfortunate. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=30.0s)]
*  The Gilets jaunes represent the most serious threat yet to Macron's agenda and his presidency. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=38.0s)]
*  The movement started off in response to Macron's proposal to raise the fuel tax, but now its target is much broader. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=44.0s)]
*  Protesters are seeking to reverse Macron's repeal of much of the wealth tax, and many want the president to resign. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=50.0s)]
*  The grassroots Gilets jaunes protest movement surfaced in October 2018, following President Macron's proposal to raise fuel taxes to reduce pollution. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=57.0s)]
*  It began in rural communities, where people depend on cars to make a living, such as Sir Caen, a private hire driver. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=70.0s)]
*  It's a big impact. Now, the gas price has increased. It's not profitable for us. That's the big problem. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=79.0s)]
*  The Gilets jaunes movement is strongest in small cities and towns outside of France's big metropolitan areas. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=88.0s)]
*  Wages there tend to be low, and French taxes are high. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=96.0s)]
*  In fact, the OECD recently said that France is the most tax economy out of all of its member countries. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=100.0s)]
*  By mid-November, more than a quarter of a million people took part in Gilets jaunes protests, and in Paris in December, such events had descended into rioting. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=106.0s)]
*  The movement, which mobilises through social media platforms, has largely rebuffed the government's appeals to negotiate, discouraging representatives from sitting down with officials. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=118.0s)]
*  Its appeal has now broadened too, becoming a rallying cry against the government and what protesters call a president of the rich. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=130.0s)]
*  Paris residents like Rabat Mondes say people have had enough. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=141.0s)]
*  All the policies that touch important sums, but for the people, they're only half. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=145.0s)]
*  Some protesters, such as Laura Cordonnier, are optimistic. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=175.0s)]
*  Others, like Benjamin Vrignot, take a different view about rising costs. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lvtYiOiCQU&t=182.0s)]
