# Why First Republic Bank Was Seized and Sold to JPMorgan Chase  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4)
*  The U.S. government seized First Republic Bank on May 1st and struck a deal to sell the bulk of its operations to JPMorgan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=0.0s)]
*  Regulators hope the move will head off a chaotic collapse that could reignite the banking crisis. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=8.0s)]
*  No way. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=14.0s)]
*  Ben Eisen covers banking and finance for the Journal. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=15.0s)]
*  He explains how First Republic became the second largest bank to fail in the U.S. and what it means for customers, investors, and the industry. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=18.0s)]
*  First Republic had this business model that was just sort of perfectly built for a certain time period. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=28.0s)]
*  When interest rates were really low, the bank collected a lot of deposits that made a lot of mortgages. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=33.0s)]
*  But when rates suddenly shifted last year, the bank's business model started to look a little bit more precarious. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=38.0s)]
*  After Silicon Valley Bank and Signature failed in March, everyone pretty much immediately started looking to First Republic as the next risky bank in the system. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=45.0s)]
*  Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic, they had similar enough client bases and similar enough risks and problems that investors and customers and really anyone eyeing this banking crisis started to kind of lump them together. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=55.0s)]
*  Some of the biggest banks collected $30 billion worth of their own money and they deposited it at First Republic Bank, basically trying to make up for the deposits that customers had pulled. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=69.0s)]
*  It was helpful for a day, but it didn't stop the panic. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=81.0s)]
*  Coming into April 24th, First Republic was already in a pretty bad spot. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=86.0s)]
*  After the bank released its earnings and really didn't impress people with what it showed, you had this period of time where the stock was falling really rapidly. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=91.0s)]
*  There was a sense that this bank was increasingly at risk of being seized. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=99.0s)]
*  Early in the morning of May 1st, an announcement came out that JP Morgan would be buying First Republic Bank. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=105.0s)]
*  This was a deal that was orchestrated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=112.0s)]
*  When the FDIC conducts this process to sale a bank that it's seizing, it's basically looking for the best bid. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=116.0s)]
*  And in the deal, JP Morgan will be taking on some $92 billion in deposits from First Republic, buying a lot of assets, including the bank's loans and bonds. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=122.0s)]
*  Shareholders will get wiped out. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=133.0s)]
*  This is a deal that will effectively allow First Republic to live on as a part of JP Morgan. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=135.0s)]
*  Let me be very clear. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=142.0s)]
*  While depositors are being protected, shareholders are losing their investments. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=143.0s)]
*  And critically, taxpayers are not the ones that are on the hook. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=148.0s)]
*  The resolution for First Republic appears to be the end of this stage of the banking crisis. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=152.0s)]
*  That said, the problems that kind of led to this crisis haven't necessarily been resolved. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=159.0s)]
*  Interest rates rose really quickly. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=165.0s)]
*  The value of assets on banks' balance sheets fell a lot. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=167.0s)]
*  It doesn't appear that anything's imminent at this moment, but I think a lot of people would be hesitant to say this is over. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=170.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqn1ZD8QUm4&t=178.0s)]
