Video Description: U.S. employers shed 701,000 jobs in March, in the worst month for job losses since the 2007-2009 recession. But these losses still don't show the pandemic's full impact on the labor market. WSJ's Eric Morath explains. Photo: JOHN MINCHILLO/ASSOCIATED PRESS

# March Jobs Report Doesn't Tell the Full Story; Here's Why  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE)
*  In April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued its first jobs report since the coronavirus [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=0.0s)]
*  pandemic overwhelmed the U.S. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=6.2s)]
*  The new data say that U.S. employers shed 701,000 jobs in March. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=8.72s)]
*  Change in non-farm payrolls went negative for the first time in 113 months. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=13.5s)]
*  The unemployment rate also rose to 4.4% from a 50-year low of 3.5%. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=19.12s)]
*  But it's still unlikely that these losses show the full impact of the crisis. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=25.04s)]
*  For the most recent jobs report, it's capturing the labor market before the worst of the coronavirus [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=29.36s)]
*  pandemic took hold in the United States and before many states acted to restrict movement [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  and close non-essential businesses. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=43.44s)]
*  Late in March, a different metric, initial jobless claims, shot to record highs. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  Then, the next week, 6.6 million people filed claims. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=50.4s)]
*  Economists say that these numbers foreshadow a coming surge in unemployment. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=54.64s)]
*  Here's how to read the March jobs report in light of the shutdowns. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=59.44s)]
*  Like nearly all such jobs reports, the March 1 was based on surveys that look at the week [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=64.72s)]
*  that includes the 12th of the month. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=69.84s)]
*  In March 2020, that was the 8th through the 14th. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=71.84s)]
*  This month's survey was taken before many cities and states shut down businesses to fight the spread of the coronavirus. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=75.2s)]
*  New York State announced on March 20th that non-essential businesses would close that weekend. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=81.68s)]
*  More states and cities issued orders throughout the week. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=87.36s)]
*  And on March 30th, governors from Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Virginia issued stay-at-home orders too. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=90.24s)]
*  By April 1st, the majority of states had issued some version of a stay-at-home order. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=97.36s)]
*  If the broad shutdowns that we're seeing now continue, we're going to see a staggering effect on the labor market. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=102.4s)]
*  Economists that I've spoke to have said they expect as many as 20 million jobs could be lost. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=109.44s)]
*  To put that into perspective, less than 9 million jobs were lost during the Great Recession. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=116.72s)]
*  Look deeper into the report and you'll find more clues about the virus's impact. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  1.8 million people reported being on temporary layoff. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  And average hours worked per week were 34.2, which was down from 34.4 in February. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=131.76s)]
*  Wages, meanwhile, ticked up. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=138.0s)]
*  And the reason for that is job losses expected to be concentrated among lower wage workers, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=140.0s)]
*  people that work at restaurants, people that work at hotels. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=144.88s)]
*  Temporary hires is usually the first area to slow down or fall when the economy is at a point of stress. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=147.6s)]
*  The report is also subject to unusual statistical distortions. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  We're not so sure about the surveys that underlie this because many businesses were closed or no one was in the office. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=159.6s)]
*  And if no one's there to give the response, it's possible that numbers were depressed and we're not getting an accurate picture. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=166.0s)]
*  And some of the people who lost their jobs may be counted as out of the labor force, rather than unemployed because they're not actively seeking work at a time when the virus has shut businesses. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=172.4s)]
*  The April jobs report will be released May 8th. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=181.84s)]
*  And that's going to give us even greater insight into the effect from the coronavirus pandemic. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=184.88s)]
*  It will likely capture that hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans have been laid off and that the unemployment rate could be skyrocketing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=191.2s)]
*  Some economists say well into the double digits. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUcGNeou1QE&t=200.8s)]
