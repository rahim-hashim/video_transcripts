# How Tesla's Stock Jumped 200% in Half a Year | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng)
*  Elon Musk has painted this world of electric cars that can drive themselves, but if you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=0.0s)]
*  couldn't keep the company afloat, then was Tesla going to be able to survive long enough [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=5.96s)]
*  for Elon Musk to deliver this vision? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=10.76s)]
*  Less than a year ago, things looked bleak for Tesla when shares dropped below $200. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=13.56s)]
*  But in just seven short months, CEO Elon Musk has turned the company into the most valuable [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=18.96s)]
*  U.S. automaker of all time. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  So how did the embattled founder get back to delivering the impossible for his shareholders? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=27.6s)]
*  2017 and 2018 were largely a trip through hell for Elon Musk and Tesla. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=32.68s)]
*  Things didn't work out as planned. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=37.96s)]
*  Boring bonhead questions are not cool. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=39.44s)]
*  Next. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  There's tobacco and marijuana in there. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  Today the SEC filed securities fraud charges against Elon Musk, stemming from his August [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=47.16s)]
*  7, 2018 statements that he was considering taking Tesla private. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=52.44s)]
*  These image problems for Musk were compounded by production issues for Tesla. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=57.44s)]
*  Model 3 deliveries were delayed and the promised $35,000 price tag was never met. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=62.12s)]
*  He had very ambitious targets to build the Model 3 compact car in California and it turned [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=67.6s)]
*  out way harder than he expected. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  In part because of Elon Musk's vision for automation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=74.92s)]
*  He talked about an idea of being able to turn the lights off and let the robots do their [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=78.2s)]
*  work. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=81.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, the plan and the vision turned out to be much more complicated than anyone anticipated [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  or at least he anticipated. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=87.16s)]
*  Then, on day one of 2019, U.S. customers were hit with an effective price increase to buy [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  any Tesla. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=94.72s)]
*  The federal tax credit for electric vehicles was cut in half as part of a planned yearlong [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=96.24s)]
*  phase out. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=101.12s)]
*  The company announced it was lowering the vehicle's price because it was essentially [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=102.72s)]
*  trying to counteract that effective price increase. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=106.28s)]
*  Some took that as a sign that Tesla perhaps had peaked at the number of customers in the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=109.88s)]
*  U.S. willing or able to afford that higher priced Model 3. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  A week later, Tesla started construction of a new factory in China, the country's first [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=120.0s)]
*  entirely foreign-owned car plant without any local partners. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=124.92s)]
*  China's the world's largest auto market, huge consumer of electric vehicles and luxury [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=129.08s)]
*  vehicles. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  So in a lot of ways, a really good place for Tesla to play. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  We're incredibly excited to break ground on the Shanghai Jager factory. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=139.44s)]
*  Elon promised that by the end of the year, the factory would be up and running and they'd [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=144.36s)]
*  be building cars. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=148.32s)]
*  That was a remarkable promise to make and a lot of close auto industry observers really [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=149.32s)]
*  questioned if that was going to be possible, thinking that perhaps this was yet again another [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=155.36s)]
*  overly ambitious target that Elon Musk was setting for the company and that in reality [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=160.4s)]
*  it would probably take much longer. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=164.68s)]
*  First quarter sales were worse than expected. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=166.8s)]
*  Beginning the year with a loss just months after Musk ensured shareholders that Tesla [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=169.6s)]
*  would be profitable every quarter into the future, short of a disaster. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=173.6s)]
*  Analysts looked at it and they really began to wonder what the demand level was like here [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=178.28s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=183.32s)]
*  Some of the older vehicles like the Model S and the Model X had been the underpinning [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=184.32s)]
*  of the company's business and if demand was falling off for those vehicles, that would [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=188.76s)]
*  raise questions about kind of the financial house that Tesla had built. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  The stock continued to fall and in early June, Tesla closed at just under $179 per share, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=197.58s)]
*  the company's lowest closing price of 2019. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  So the third quarter, we're starting to see the fruits of Tesla's labor. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=208.38000000000002s)]
*  They'd been working to get the Model 3s to Europe and into China and a turning point [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=212.02s)]
*  for Tesla in 2019 was really the announcement of a surprise profit and the company started [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=216.94s)]
*  looking like, well, maybe they are on the right track and return to a story of potential [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=223.78s)]
*  growth. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=230.38s)]
*  At the end of November, Musk revealed Tesla's long-awaited Cybertruck, the world's first [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=233.38s)]
*  electric pickup truck. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=238.54s)]
*  It doesn't look like anything else. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=240.02s)]
*  As the event began to unfold, they were talking about features that really you don't normally [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=244.54s)]
*  talk about in a new car, such as windows that were bulletproof. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=250.24s)]
*  And so on stage, Elon and his people were making a demonstration of this and they got [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=254.0s)]
*  these metal balls. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=259.88s)]
*  Sure? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=261.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=262.2s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=263.2s)]
*  This is like unheard of. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=266.3s)]
*  You don't really don't see a CEO on stage with such a colossal demonstration. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=268.44s)]
*  So the next day, you might think the stock might go down, but in fact, you're seeing [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=274.08s)]
*  huge conversations about this vehicle. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=278.12s)]
*  Just days later, Musk tweeted that more than 250,000 people had placed preorders for a [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=281.04s)]
*  Cybertruck. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=286.12s)]
*  From there, something interesting happened. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=287.76000000000005s)]
*  It returned the conversation to the future of Tesla. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=289.72s)]
*  It was always, what have they done today and why are they struggling to get these cars [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  out? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=297.32000000000005s)]
*  And what Musk has had been able to do is put the conversation yet again to this new vision [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=298.32000000000005s)]
*  of what he was promising for personal transportation. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=304.08s)]
*  Exactly a year after breaking ground at the Shanghai factory, Tesla held a press conference [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=307.12s)]
*  to announce their first deliveries of China-made Model 3s to Chinese customers. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=314.35999999999996s)]
*  The carmaker also confirmed it had met another of Musk's seemingly impossible goals, delivering [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=319.8s)]
*  at least 360,000 electric vehicles in 2019. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=325.53999999999996s)]
*  The surprise here was that Elon delivered on what he'd promised, something that he'd [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=330.76s)]
*  struggled in the past, but here he was executing, something that really enthused investors because [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=334.36s)]
*  if he could deliver on these promises, what other promises could he deliver on? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=340.36s)]
*  Tesla just reported another profitable quarter, but the future is still uncertain. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  The company has yet to deliver a full year profit and it's unclear how long success [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=349.92s)]
*  in China will last. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=354.4s)]
*  The entire Chinese car market has been falling steadily for two years and demand for electric [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=356.64s)]
*  vehicles has declined the past few months. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=361.64s)]
*  There's still a question about whether Tesla got into China a little bit too late, if the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=364.44s)]
*  party might be over. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=369.47999999999996s)]
*  So one of the things that Tesla's going to face here in coming months is what's the demand [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=370.94s)]
*  for its vehicles? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkmZHFXOng&t=374.88s)]
