# The Surprising Ways Inflation Is Hitting Diapers | WSJ Price Index
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 04, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM)
*  The average baby will go through over 3,000 diapers in a single year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=0.0s)]
*  At around $70 to $80 a month, the cost of these diapers will set a family back nearly [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=5.44s)]
*  $1,000 a year. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=10.8s)]
*  And right now, this essential is getting more expensive for millions of Americans. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  In March, diaper manufacturer Kimberly-Clark announced that it would be raising prices [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=18.12s)]
*  on many of its products, including diapers. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=22.44s)]
*  And then competitor Procter & Gamble announced it would be doing the same. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=25.62s)]
*  For families with multiple children, these price hikes could add up to hundreds of dollars [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=30.18s)]
*  more per year. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=34.6s)]
*  These price increases are happening on household goods, on food, on gas. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=35.6s)]
*  Not only is it an amount that adds up, it's an amount that comes in addition to everything [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=40.5s)]
*  else costing more. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=44.14s)]
*  So what's causing diaper prices to rise so dramatically? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  It has a lot to do with the prices you're seeing here and here. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=49.5s)]
*  I'm a big kid now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=55.62s)]
*  Parents are more likely to choose loves. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=61.059999999999995s)]
*  Pampers, the number one pediatrician-recommended brand. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=62.66s)]
*  We're huggies. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=65.3s)]
*  We got just what you need. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=66.3s)]
*  It may look like there are a lot of options to buy diapers, but in reality, there are [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=67.3s)]
*  less than what it may seem. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=71.86s)]
*  Only two companies control about 80% of the US disposable diaper industry, Procter & Gamble [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=74.06s)]
*  and Kimberly-Clark, the same two companies that announced price hikes earlier this year. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=79.28s)]
*  It means these companies are less vulnerable to competition. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=84.42s)]
*  Sharon Turlip reports on consumer products for The Wall Street Journal. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=87.89999999999999s)]
*  If P&G makes a decision on pricing, that might drive the whole market, whether it's up or [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=91.42s)]
*  down. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=95.9s)]
*  They don't have the concern as much of having higher prices and then having their [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=96.9s)]
*  customers go somewhere else. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=100.94s)]
*  Most disposable diapers are made with layers of blended materials to increase absorbency, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=102.97999999999999s)]
*  including this fluffy part, which is made from wood pulp. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=107.34s)]
*  Just a few months ago, lumber prices were through the roof, powered by low mortgage [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=110.5s)]
*  rates and demand for home improvement projects that drove a suburban building boom. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=114.5s)]
*  This lifted the price of wood, including pulp, which in turn drove up costs for diaper manufacturing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=118.98s)]
*  Cost of logging have escalated due to the inputs at that stage in the value chain, namely [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  the labor and the logistics and the equipment associated with felling trees. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=131.66s)]
*  David Garfield is a consultant who has worked in the consumer products industry for almost [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=137.26s)]
*  three decades. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=141.29999999999998s)]
*  And those increases in costs do ripple through the production of pulp and paper. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  But one of the biggest commodities driving the price of diapers is the same one that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=148.42s)]
*  is running your car. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=152.74s)]
*  Oil prices soaring, an OPEC-fueled rally sending crude prices higher, now up about 20% just [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=154.34s)]
*  over the last month. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=159.9s)]
*  As prices have risen at the pump, so have costs to produce diapers. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=161.18s)]
*  Some of those ingredients or materials that are incorporated into diapers are derived [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=165.26s)]
*  from petroleum. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=169.26s)]
*  And so with the increase in the price of the barrel of oil comes an increase in the material [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=171.66s)]
*  that goes into making diapers. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=178.29999999999998s)]
*  There's also the knock-on effect of diesel fuel prices up, which impact the transportation [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  costs as well as the material costs. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=185.73999999999998s)]
*  Petroleum or crude oil is the same raw material used to make sodium polyacrylate. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=188.38s)]
*  This is a polymer that's used in diapers to help make them more absorbent. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=193.22s)]
*  It's what these absorption beads are made out of. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=196.94s)]
*  Back in February, a winter storm pummeled Texas, forcing many petrochemical manufacturing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=199.7s)]
*  plants to shut down, including those that make acrylic acid, a compound in sodium polyacrylate. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=204.54s)]
*  The extreme weather caused acrylic acid shortages for months, which drove up the price of sodium [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=210.66s)]
*  polyacrylate. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=215.34s)]
*  This contributed to the rising costs of diapers. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=216.54s)]
*  Part of it was this piling-out effect. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=218.7s)]
*  It was just one more thing on top of everything else. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=221.02s)]
*  But it made this material harder to come by. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=224.3s)]
*  And so, you know, at the time when I spoke to Kimberly Clark, they said, you know, we're [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=227.46s)]
*  not, it's not driving a shortage, but it's certainly limiting options. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=232.62s)]
*  But it wasn't just limited access to raw materials that have driven up diaper prices. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=238.22s)]
*  Throughout the pandemic, ongoing shipping issues due to surging online orders, COVID [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=243.06s)]
*  restrictions and driver shortages have caused significant delays across the U.S. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=246.9s)]
*  This has impacted deliveries across industries, including diapers, which has caused freight [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=252.22s)]
*  costs to balloon. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=256.7s)]
*  You have the trucking rates, the labor for drivers, the equipment that needs to be maintained [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=258.42s)]
*  and replaced, even the insurance costs. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=264.54s)]
*  So producers are seeing significant increases recently in overall transportation costs. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=267.3s)]
*  Divers, unlike some other smaller personal care items, are impacted more by shipping [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=274.02s)]
*  costs due to the product's bulky size. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=277.96s)]
*  The vast majority of diaper production in the U.S. is local. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=280.34s)]
*  There's a very, very small percentage that is imported. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=284.29999999999995s)]
*  It's a highly, what they call volumetric product, meaning that per dollar of sales, it's expensive [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=289.14s)]
*  to ship. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=296.21999999999997s)]
*  So it's largely trucking transportation within the U.S. from the factories to distribution [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=297.22s)]
*  centers and ultimately through retail channel partners. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  Still, there's one other factor affecting the price of diapers that has been trending [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=307.94000000000005s)]
*  for years. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=312.14000000000004s)]
*  In the U.S., births have been steadily dropping for the past decade. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=313.38000000000005s)]
*  The number of babies born in 2020 dropped by 4% compared with the previous year, partially [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=317.54s)]
*  driven by a trend of women choosing to have fewer children later in life. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=322.92s)]
*  As the birth rate declines, it has an instant effect on diaper sales because babies need [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=326.94s)]
*  diapers the minute they're born. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=332.46s)]
*  So if there's fewer babies born, it's not like some products where 10 years down the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=334.41999999999996s)]
*  road a smaller population might trickle down. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=338.94s)]
*  If fewer babies are born in 2020, diaper sales go down in 2020. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=342.26s)]
*  To make up for lower diaper sales, companies have increased prices to partially fill the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=347.28s)]
*  gap. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=351.53999999999996s)]
*  To offset this declining birth rate, the companies are trying to basically sell more expensive [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=352.54s)]
*  diapers that are nicer diapers. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=357.1s)]
*  So that competition has become more intense. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=359.06s)]
*  I mean, there's, you know, more organic diapers. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=361.1s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of features in diapers now that didn't exist 10 years ago. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=364.62s)]
*  As diaper prices have increased, for many working families, the financial strain has [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=369.02000000000004s)]
*  added to a list of growing expenses. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=372.94s)]
*  The need in 2021 seems to be almost as high or higher as it was in 2020. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=375.46000000000004s)]
*  So even as the economy is recovering, it's not going back to 2019 levels. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=382.3s)]
*  Experts like David Garfield say that even if commodity and shipping costs come back [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=386.78000000000003s)]
*  down because of increased margins, diaper price increases will likely stay inflated [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=390.26s)]
*  for the near future. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SSySOz3VM&t=395.26s)]
