# Why America’s Biggest Brands Are Failing to Keep Up in China | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc)
*  This may look just like your regular American fast-food restaurant, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=0.0s)]
*  with a meal that comes with a burger, fries, and a drink. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=6.44s)]
*  But if you look closely, the rapper proudly declares that this burger has been made in [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=13.4s)]
*  China. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  I'm sitting in Tastien's. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  It's China's answer to McDonald's. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=24.0s)]
*  And as you can see it, you have all this language here made in China, a Chinese burger [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=26.32s)]
*  for a Chinese stomach. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  And you can see that they've just got all sorts of Chinese imagery around a little bit [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=33.92s)]
*  of McDonald's transported to Imperial-era China. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=38.44s)]
*  And Tastien is just one example of a Chinese brand squeezing out U.S. rivals. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=43.32s)]
*  China once presented a huge opportunity for American brands, but now, local challenges [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=48.44s)]
*  are eating their lunch. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=53.56s)]
*  And that threatens dominance they have held for decades. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=55.24s)]
*  China is the world's second largest consumer market. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=61.32s)]
*  The country has more than one billion shoppers, were once seen as an untapped goldmine for [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=64.08s)]
*  Western brands. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=68.94s)]
*  This is Beijing's premier shopping district, and you don't have to look far to see which [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=70.6s)]
*  companies have taken center stage. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=74.76s)]
*  There's American brands all around me. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=77.16s)]
*  Over here, we got Ralph Lauren, Tom Ford, and right behind me is perhaps the best known [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=79.06s)]
*  of all of the brands, Apple. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=84.26s)]
*  In the first quarter of 2024, Apple saw its smartphone sales fall 19%, while that of its [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=86.18s)]
*  Chinese rival, Huawei Technologies, saw its sales rise 70%. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=91.66s)]
*  For China, Apple saw its revenue fall by 8% to $16.4 billion. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=97.26s)]
*  And Apple isn't the only American company that's been struggling a little bit more in [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=103.4s)]
*  China lately. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=106.9s)]
*  From luxury cosmetics firm Estee Lauder, which is expecting sales in China to fall, to retail [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=110.46000000000001s)]
*  giant Walmart, which has closed more than 100 stores nationwide over the past five years. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=117.58000000000001s)]
*  Executives of some of America's biggest brand names in China are increasingly worried about [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=123.78s)]
*  their weak performance in the country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=127.54s)]
*  Local brands are expanding so rapidly in China. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=129.82s)]
*  Any CEO who is worried about his performance, his profits, is going to be affected by them. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=132.66s)]
*  We have seen Nike stock prices fall, for example, on the back of weakening performance in China. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=139.26s)]
*  China once represented almost a fifth of Nike's global sales. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=147.78s)]
*  Nike has long dominated China's sportswear market, but that's changing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=152.18s)]
*  Younger Chinese consumers are increasingly gravitating towards brands that incorporate [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=155.82s)]
*  elements of traditional Chinese culture and style. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=160.26s)]
*  And it's allowed brands like ANTA, right over there, to make inroads in a market that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=163.5s)]
*  long has been dominated by Nike and other Western brands. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=170.17999999999998s)]
*  Chinese consumers are trying new brands like ANTA on for size. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=175.89999999999998s)]
*  And in many cases, they aren't going back. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  As the sponsor of the Chinese Olympic team, ANTA has found a place among Chinese shoppers [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=183.94s)]
*  as a brand that matches growing nationalist sentiment. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=188.62s)]
*  ANTA supports the new generation of Chinese Olympic athletes. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=191.66s)]
*  It was very much linked to very big and bold expressions of Chinese pride. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=196.54s)]
*  So think about your large logos, red and yellow color combinations. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=201.82s)]
*  It's resonating especially with younger consumers today because they don't have the same level [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=206.9s)]
*  of adoration for the West as the past generations. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=212.34s)]
*  It's not about, you know, blind kind of, I'll buy something from the West just by virtue [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=215.06s)]
*  of it being from the West. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=220.7s)]
*  American brands have reaped huge profits by capitalizing on changing Chinese consumer [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=223.62s)]
*  tastes. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=227.74s)]
*  Starbucks largely created China's new coffee culture and a country long dominated by tea [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=229.22s)]
*  drinkers. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=233.7s)]
*  But that supremacy is now under threat. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=234.7s)]
*  At the end of 2023, Luckin Coffee surpassed Starbucks as China's biggest coffee chain [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=238.5s)]
*  by sales and units. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=243.3s)]
*  Analysts credit Luckin's success to its operating model, which requires minimal staff to run [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=246.14000000000001s)]
*  their branches. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=250.46s)]
*  Luckin prices its coffee at a substantial discount, often up to 50 percent less than [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=252.06s)]
*  Starbucks. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=256.90000000000003s)]
*  You know, there's a price wall going around with coffee brands. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=257.90000000000003s)]
*  Starbucks has largely avoided that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=261.18s)]
*  They are kind of committing to their premium offering. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=262.7s)]
*  They're focusing on what they do best. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=265.86s)]
*  That should be the way for many of these American brands who feel threatened because you don't [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=267.86s)]
*  want your brand identity to get lost as you follow the trend. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=272.02000000000004s)]
*  Starbucks executives insist they won't cut prices as the company positions itself as [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=275.94s)]
*  a superior brand. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=279.78000000000003s)]
*  But sales for Starbucks have dropped 8 percent during the first quarter of this year, while [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=281.26s)]
*  Luckin's have surged 41 percent. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=284.98s)]
*  That contributed to the company lowering its forecast for the rest of the year. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=288.26s)]
*  The announcement spooked the market, causing Starbucks' share price to plummet in May. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=292.1s)]
*  The U.S. coffee giant still has plans to make China its biggest market, but it's now in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=297.22s)]
*  a race to win wallets. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=301.18s)]
*  In 2023, Starbucks opened nearly 900 new stores across China, bringing its total in the country [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=303.66s)]
*  to almost 7000. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=309.54s)]
*  But in that same year alone, Luckin opened more stores than the entire Starbucks operation [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=311.5s)]
*  in the country and now has nearly 19,000 locations. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=316.1s)]
*  Luckin's expanding very rapidly in tier two, tier three cities where Starbucks might not [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=320.18s)]
*  have that big of a presence. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=324.58s)]
*  It's really forging its own brand story in a way that resonates with the new middle [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=326.38s)]
*  classes are. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=330.98s)]
*  American brands have had a near free run at the Chinese market for decades, but that's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=334.46000000000004s)]
*  coming to an end. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  I think to lose out on China is a huge missed opportunity, not just in terms of dollars, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=340.78000000000003s)]
*  but in terms of cementing your brand presence in one of the largest consumer markets in [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=348.34000000000003s)]
*  the world. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=353.54s)]
*  What was once an enormous opportunity for American companies could come back to bite [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=355.06s)]
*  as Chinese rivals chip away at their market dominance. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=360.86s)]
*  But of course the real question with this Chinese burger is not, you know, whether it [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=363.46s)]
*  is very Chinese or very American. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=368.14s)]
*  It's about whether it tastes good. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOSEFRtaNc&t=369.46s)]
