The tiny Emirate has led mediation efforts in Afghanistan, Iran and Ukraine in recent years. From helping the U.S. evacuate 58,000 people after the Taliban takeover in 2021 to brokering a prisoner swap deal between the U.S. and Iran, Qatar has been involved.

# How Qatar Became the World’s Lead Hostage Negotiator | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo)
*  As the war rages over here in Gaza, mediation efforts are being led by Qatar, a tiny peninsula [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=0.0s)]
*  on the Persian Gulf, 1,100 miles away. The country has used its close ties with both Hamas and the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=6.0s)]
*  West to negotiate the release of hostages from Gaza and get others out through the border [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=11.84s)]
*  crossing with Egypt. It's just the latest example of Qatar's important role on the world stage. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=16.72s)]
*  From helping the U.S. evacuate thousands of people from Afghanistan to brokering a prisoner [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=23.52s)]
*  swap deal between the U.S. and Iran. Here's how Qatar became such an important player in global [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=28.4s)]
*  diplomacy. Qatar's location and economic clout make it strategically important to a lot of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  different countries. It shares its only land border with Saudi Arabia, a major power in the Middle East. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  And it shares the world's largest natural gas field right here with Iran, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=47.68s)]
*  Saudi's biggest regional rival. Exports of liquefied natural gas have made Qatar one of the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  wealthiest countries in the world, boosting its influence in this volatile region. This has made [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=57.68s)]
*  Qatar a critical energy partner for a lot of countries, especially those in Europe, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=62.4s)]
*  because the continent has been reducing its reliance on Russian oil and gas. Qatar is also [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=66.72s)]
*  important to the United States and right here is the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=72.0s)]
*  It's been a launching pad for operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. Last year, the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=77.28s)]
*  U.S. made Qatar a major non-NATO ally. Qatar has also made itself influential in the broader region [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=83.52s)]
*  through Al Jazeera, the largest news media network in the Middle East. But it has been criticized in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=89.36s)]
*  both the Arab world and the West for its sometimes controversial coverage of uprisings, wars, and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=94.56s)]
*  other conflicts. For example, the network broadcast video messages from Osama bin Laden after 9-11. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  Nevertheless, Qatar prides itself on being a meeting place for diverse viewpoints, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=107.84s)]
*  which was on full display when the country hosted the World Cup last year. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=112.32s)]
*  And its ambassador to the U.S. recently wrote an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=116.55999999999999s)]
*  claiming that Qatar is the Mideast's honest broker. In the 1980s and 90s, the country's leaders [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=120.55999999999999s)]
*  developed relationships with Iran as well as regional groups like Hamas in the Palestinian [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=126.72s)]
*  territories and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, groups that are considered terrorist organizations [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=132.32s)]
*  in some parts of the world. It also fostered ties with the Afghan Taliban. In 2013, the Taliban [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=137.68s)]
*  opened a political office in Qatar with support from the U.S. and Afghan governments. Years of [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=143.6s)]
*  negotiations in Doha led to a deal in 2020 for U.S. troops to withdraw from Afghanistan, ending [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=149.68s)]
*  America's longest war. But the agreement didn't bring peace to the country. The Taliban never [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=155.84s)]
*  reached a power-sharing agreement with the Afghan government, and it seized control of Kabul in 2021. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=163.36s)]
*  Qatar helped to evacuate U.S. citizens in the aftermath, and it is now Washington's diplomatic [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  representative in the country. Hamas also opened a political office in Qatar in 2012 after a request [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  by the Obama administration to establish indirect lines of communication. And Qatar has provided [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=180.96s)]
*  financial aid to Palestinians in Gaza, which is run by Hamas. That has led to accusations of funding [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=186.56s)]
*  terrorism, which Qatar denies. Qatar's complex web of relationships has caused friction with [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=193.04s)]
*  its neighbors. In 2017, it was blockaded by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt. They accused [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=199.44s)]
*  Doha of meddling in their domestic affairs, supporting extremist groups, and being too close [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=207.44s)]
*  to regional rival Iran. The four countries issued a list of demands, including shutting down Al-Jazeera [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=212.48s)]
*  and reducing ties with Tehran. Even though Qatar didn't make concessions, the blockade ended in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=218.24s)]
*  January of 2021, and the terms of the deal haven't been made public. Although the country's [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=224.0s)]
*  reestablished relations, some analysts say that the root causes of that diplomatic crisis haven't [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=229.52s)]
*  been resolved. Today, Qatar's diplomatic relationships are in the spotlight once again, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  with the country negotiating the release of hostages taken from Israel into Gaza by Hamas. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  But Qatar said that without a pause in the fighting in Gaza, its mediators won't be able to do their [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=249.12s)]
*  work. It's a very, very difficult negotiation that we've been dealing with. I always say that one of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=254.16s)]
*  the most difficult mediations is a difficult between two parties that have zero confidence in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=260.8s)]
*  each other. Israeli officials have said that Qatar's efforts are crucial at this time, but so far only [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=265.6s)]
*  a few hostages have been released. And when the crisis is over, many of Qatar's partners wanted [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=271.12s)]
*  to expel Hamas leaders from the country. That includes more than 100 members of Congress who [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=277.12s)]
*  signed a letter to President Biden. Qatar said that the political office of Hamas will remain [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=282.48s)]
*  open as long as it can be used toward peace. Some diplomats worry that those Hamas leaders could move [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=287.52s)]
*  somewhere more hostile to the West, like Iran or Syria. That could make any communication between [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=293.04s)]
*  Hamas, Israel, and the West even more complicated in situations like the one that is currently [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=298.96s)]
*  unfolding in the Middle East. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqBOWL0Lpo&t=304.48s)]
