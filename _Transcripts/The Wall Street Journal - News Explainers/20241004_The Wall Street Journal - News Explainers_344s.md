# How Israel-Iran Tensions Are Choking Commercial Flight Paths  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc)
*  As more than 180 Iranian missiles streamed down on Israel on October 1, surrounding countries [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=0.0s)]
*  were forced to shut their airspace, and airlines were left scrambling to redirect at least [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=7.92s)]
*  80 flights. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Now the prospect of a full-fledged war between Israel and Iran means navigation through this, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=14.32s)]
*  one of the most densely traversed regions of the world, has suddenly become even more [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=20.34s)]
*  complicated. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=24.8s)]
*  What we've seen over the last few years is that conflicts around the region have started [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=25.8s)]
*  to cut off some of that crucial airspace. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=30.48s)]
*  So here's how commercial airlines are adjusting to the increasingly volatile situation in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=33.0s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=39.28s)]
*  Positioned at the strategic crossroads of the major economies Asia, Africa and Europe, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=42.88s)]
*  9% of international traffic passes through the Middle East region. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  That's more than the 8% of international traffic that crosses North America. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=51.44s)]
*  Much of it goes via the Super Hub airports in the UAE and Qatar. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=56.32s)]
*  That's really attributed to this massive growth in airlines like Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=61.32s)]
*  which has started to use the Middle East as really a stopover point for connecting the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=67.24s)]
*  world's traffic. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=73.08s)]
*  But this thoroughfare linking the West and the East is a narrow one. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=74.68s)]
*  Even before the Iranian missile attacks of October 1st, airlines were detouring around [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=78.8s)]
*  Libya, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=83.56s)]
*  And Russia's war on Ukraine has turned more than 200,000 square miles of Europe into a [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=86.56s)]
*  no-fly zone, with Moscow also closing its airspace to airlines from dozens of countries [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=91.36s)]
*  in response to Western sanctions. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=97.12s)]
*  Industry experts divide the rest of the available airspace into four main corridors, across [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=100.32s)]
*  Iraq, Iran, Egypt in the south and Azerbaijan in the north. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=105.28s)]
*  But in April 2024, only these two routes were left for airlines to use, when Iran's first [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=110.64s)]
*  missile and drone attack on Israel resulted in the temporary closure of airspace over [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=116.16s)]
*  Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and partially over Iran, impacting flights across the region. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=120.36s)]
*  Following Iran's latest attack on Israel, Europe's aviation regulator has now issued [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=128.04s)]
*  a recommendation for airlines to halt all operations in Israeli, Lebanese and Iranian [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=132.24s)]
*  airspace. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=137.52s)]
*  Aviation just in general is often one of the first places you can see when a conflict starts [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=139.4s)]
*  to unravel or starts to take place, because countries have a duty to protect civilians [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=145.4s)]
*  flying over or through their airspace. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=151.24s)]
*  The killing of senior members from the militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah in late July put [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=154.28s)]
*  commercial aviation on high alert in the Middle East, prompting airlines to adjust operations [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  in the region once more. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=163.8s)]
*  We've seen airlines shift to morning flights as opposed to evening flights. That's really [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  designed to prevent their crew and their aircraft being stuck overnight in an area that may [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  or may not fall into a significant conflict. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=176.96s)]
*  By mid-August, dozens of airlines temporarily rerouted or cancelled some of their flights [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=180.8s)]
*  in the region. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=185.6s)]
*  There are small adjustments to airspace that have these huge ramifications on airlines [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  for passengers, longer flights, less access to destinations and more expensive tickets. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=191.56s)]
*  If it costs more for the airline to operate, it'll cost more for the passenger to fly. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=197.0s)]
*  For example, a 17-hour-long flight from Perth, Australia to London had to be modified to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=202.0s)]
*  include a pit stop in Singapore, adding about three hours to the journey. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=207.12s)]
*  And to avoid the turbulent Middle East, the flight was rerouted over Afghanistan. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=212.04s)]
*  Afghan airspace has remained mostly unused for transiting since the Taliban returned [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=217.64s)]
*  to power in 2021. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=221.72s)]
*  In late August 2023, dozens of aircraft, mainly Afghan ones, passed through the country on [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=224.48s)]
*  a daily basis. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=230.2s)]
*  A year later, nearly 200 did, according to data by flight tracking organisation FlightRadar24. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=231.2s)]
*  As in July, the European Aviation Safety Regulator warned that extremist groups remain [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=239.24s)]
*  active and might sporadically target aviation facilities. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=244.16s)]
*  The regulator also raised concern over their absence or limited air traffic service capacities [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=248.60000000000002s)]
*  across the entire country. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=253.82000000000002s)]
*  Qantas, operating the flight from Perth to London, ran the modified route with a stopover [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=256.2s)]
*  in Singapore for around a week in April and two weeks in August. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=261.1s)]
*  Commenting on the use of Afghan airspace, Qantas said that they regularly review and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=265.52000000000004s)]
*  determine the flight paths taken by their aircraft based on multiple factors, including [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  security and weather. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=274.6s)]
*  Aviation experts say many airlines are already operating at the margin of profitability on [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  long-haul flights. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=282.48s)]
*  And so the request from Europe's aviation regulator for airlines to halt all operations [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=284.62s)]
*  in Israeli, Lebanese and Iranian airspace is the latest challenge to the viability of [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  some of those long-distance flights. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=294.36s)]
*  We're seeing coming out of the pandemic massive investments being made in Turkey, in India, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=297.52s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=303.52s)]
*  These airlines buying hundreds of new aircraft with the goal of really connecting Saudi Arabia, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=306.0s)]
*  India to the world. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=312.64s)]
*  So these really massive operations are going to rely more and more increasingly on the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=314.28s)]
*  Middle East as this really critical connection point. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=319.08s)]
*  This is really the sliver of airspace that punches above its weight when it comes to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=322.24s)]
*  its significance for commercial aviation. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=327.52s)]
*  This risk of an escalating crisis or a broad Middle East regional conflict, the fallout [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=330.08s)]
*  for airlines would be incredibly significant. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3xqZJhazc&t=335.68s)]
