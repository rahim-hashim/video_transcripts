# Historian Explains Why Dropping Biden Won’t Help Democrats | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ)
*  President Biden is under mounting pressure to drop his bid for a second term. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=0.0s)]
*  So far, he has vowed to stay in the race. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=5.12s)]
*  I am running and going to win again. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=7.92s)]
*  After the president's disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=10.24s)]
*  cracks begin to emerge in his party's unity. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=15.36s)]
*  Democrats are buzzing about who would replace Biden if he were to drop out. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  American presidential elections are essentially votes up or down [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=22.72s)]
*  on the strength and performance of the White House party. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=28.48s)]
*  In other words, it's governance, not campaigning that counts. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=31.76s)]
*  Alan Lichtman is a presidential historian known for the 13 keys to the White House, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=36.24s)]
*  a forecasting system that has been used to successfully predict nine of the last 10 elections. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=41.44s)]
*  To him, it is still the best bet for Democrats to have Biden stay in the race. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=47.2s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=52.56s)]
*  The 13 keys to the White House are 13 true-false questions pertaining primarily to the strength [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=53.28s)]
*  and performance of the White House party, where an answer of true always favors stability. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=60.72s)]
*  If six or more of the keys are false, we have earthquakes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=66.64s)]
*  If fewer than six are false, we have stability. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=71.6s)]
*  While some Democrats ponder a variety of governors and lawmakers, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=76.88s)]
*  a ticket led by Vice President Kamala Harris remains the most likely alternative. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=81.36s)]
*  As Biden's running mate, Harris would be able to use the money already raised by Biden's campaign committee. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=86.24s)]
*  The vice president would also have some key endorsements from influential Democratic lawmakers. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  I would support her if he were to step aside. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=96.88s)]
*  However, if Biden were to exit the race, two of the 13 keys would automatically be introduced. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=100.63999999999999s)]
*  If Biden were to exit the race, two of the 13 keys would automatically be in jeopardy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=106.88s)]
*  The incumbency key, whether or not the incumbent candidate is the sitting president, and the contest key, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=111.84s)]
*  which looks at whether there is competition within the incumbent party for the nomination. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=117.52s)]
*  Biden running checks off two keys, right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=122.24s)]
*  Biden steps aside, they lose obviously the incumbency, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=124.8s)]
*  and it's not at all clear that there wouldn't be a big party fight. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=129.6s)]
*  There is one extremely unlikely scenario, Lichtman says, could help Democrats keep those keys. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=133.04s)]
*  Let's assume for a moment that the pressure is so great that Biden has to step aside. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=139.12s)]
*  Here is what he should do to preserve the keys and keep the Democrats' best chances for election alive. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=144.32s)]
*  He should say, for the good of the country, I am making the ultimate sacrifice. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  I am stepping down from the presidency. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=157.84s)]
*  Then Kamala Harris would become president, and they would secure the incumbency key. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=160.96s)]
*  And he could then release all of his delegates to Harris to secure the contest key. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  That's the only situation under which the Democrats would not start out some keys deficit. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  With only four months left before election day, some keys have already been decided. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=180.8s)]
*  Democrats get a false for-party mandate because they lost nine seats in the House [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  during the 2022 midterm elections. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  The short-term economy key is marked true because the U.S. is not in a recession. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=192.56s)]
*  I don't call the recessions myself. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=197.52s)]
*  I rely on the National Bureau of Economic Research. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  You heard a lot of criticism about the economy, you know, about the high inflation. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  But there are other indicators that are very positive. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=209.12s)]
*  Strong growth, near record low unemployment. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  As for long-term economy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=215.36s)]
*  It looks at real per capita growth during the term, and it compares it to the average [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=217.28s)]
*  of the previous two terms. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=222.0s)]
*  And that key is solidly in the Democratic favor. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=223.52s)]
*  Also in their favor are the policy change and scandal keys. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=228.24s)]
*  To turn the scandal key, it has to involve the president himself, not the president's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=231.68s)]
*  children, not the president's brother or sisters. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=237.68s)]
*  So the Hunter Biden situation doesn't turn the scandal key according to its definitions. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=240.48s)]
*  So Biden's a vanilla guy. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=246.8s)]
*  That's why he doesn't win the charisma key, but that's why he does win the scandal key. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  According to Lichtman, Kamala Harris wouldn't get the charisma key either. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=252.72s)]
*  None of the potential candidates would. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  You're talking about the once in a generation, truly inspirational and broadly inspirational [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=259.36s)]
*  candidates. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=265.68s)]
*  The truth is we wouldn't disagree much on who they are. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=266.32s)]
*  Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama in 2008. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=269.52s)]
*  Not necessarily in 2012. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=275.6s)]
*  John F. Kennedy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  It's very few of them over a hundred years. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=278.88s)]
*  Even Donald Trump, who is known for his showmanship, doesn't make the grade. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=281.36s)]
*  You have to be broadly appealing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  And Trump only appeals to a narrow base. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=288.24s)]
*  That's another key in favor of the Democrats. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=292.0s)]
*  The remaining four have yet to be determined. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=294.88s)]
*  Whether it's Biden or Harris at the top of the ticket, the administration's handling [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=297.44s)]
*  of the wars in the Middle East and in Ukraine has led to big question marks around the two [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=301.84s)]
*  keys related to foreign or military affairs. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=307.28s)]
*  If she were to become the candidate, she would be running on the record of the three and a half [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=310.24s)]
*  years plus of the Biden administration. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  And all the same keys, as they fall one way or the other, would be the same whether it was Biden, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  Harris or anyone else. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=326.0s)]
*  Right now, the Democrats are two keys down. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=328.88s)]
*  That means four more would need to drop for Trump to become the predicted winner. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=331.68s)]
*  Questions about Biden's age and mental acuity have thrown his party into crisis, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=336.08s)]
*  with some Democrats arguing that a younger, more energetic Kamala Harris could have a broader [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=341.04s)]
*  appeal, particularly among women and black voters. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=346.16s)]
*  But when it comes to the 13 keys system, Lichtman says that replacing Biden with Harris [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=349.6s)]
*  only puts Democrats at greater risk. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=354.8s)]
*  Harris is not the only name being discussed. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=357.68s)]
*  Governors Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California are also seen as contenders. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=360.32s)]
*  Well, we're in uncharted territory here since there's never been such a situation [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  where after getting more than enough delegates to get nominated, a candidate withdraws. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=371.52s)]
*  Still, none of the alternatives bring anything new to the table under the framework of the 13 keys. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  Because they're premised on how elections really work as a referendum on how the party [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=382.24s)]
*  holding the White House has fared, the keys have very little to do with the individual candidates. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKi0_nlIfQ&t=390.0s)]
