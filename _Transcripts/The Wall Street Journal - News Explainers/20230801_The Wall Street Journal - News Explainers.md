# Why the FTC Is Losing Against Big Tech  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM)
*  In her first two years at the Federal Trade Commission, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=0.0s)]
*  Chair Lena Kahn has already taken on the biggest tech titans in the world. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=2.68s)]
*  Her beef is with the biggest companies. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=7.0s)]
*  And she's lost big to some of them. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=9.6s)]
*  I'm certainly not somebody who thinks that success is marked by a 100% court record. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=11.64s)]
*  That strategy has made her a lightning rod for controversy and criticism. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=16.84s)]
*  This raises the question, Chair Kahn, are you losing on purpose? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=21.0s)]
*  So what drives her to take on the toughest fights? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=24.12s)]
*  And what happens if she doesn't win? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=26.96s)]
*  Antitrust lawyers say that this is as aggressive as they've seen the FTC in a very long time. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=29.52s)]
*  Over the last century, we've seen time and time again that when we have robust antitrust enforcement [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=36.36s)]
*  and robust competition, that really sets us up best to have the strongest, most thriving economy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  In 2021, the year Kahn was sworn in as chair, the FTC issued 42 letters of investigation over M&A. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=47.52s)]
*  That's almost twice the amount in 2020 and the highest in more than a decade. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=54.84s)]
*  When the FTC does investigations, they type their own resources and they sort of tie a deal in knots for as long as a year. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=59.28s)]
*  And investigating more deals can slow down the merger market overall. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=67.88s)]
*  More important is the chilling effect that they're having on M&A activity in general. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=72.28s)]
*  Stoller is a friend and former coworker of Kahn. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  They're trying to address activities that are central to coercive behavior in the economy right now [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=81.16s)]
*  by challenging vertical mergers by big companies, dominant infrastructure players. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=89.08s)]
*  And it's not just the number of mergers the FTC investigates. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=95.08s)]
*  It's also the type of company the agency is scrutinizing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=98.52s)]
*  We are also entirely outgunned, especially when we are up against some of the most formidable [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  and wealthiest and most powerful companies in America. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=107.64s)]
*  But that hasn't stopped Kahn from taking on companies like META or Microsoft. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=110.72000000000001s)]
*  Lena's supporters do think that she's bringing the cases that the government was too chicken in the past to bring. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=114.72000000000001s)]
*  But those big shots haven't necessarily panned out. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=121.64000000000001s)]
*  In February, the FTC lost its case to block META from acquiring virtual reality company within. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  And in early July, a federal judge sided with Microsoft after the agency sued to block its merger with gaming company Activision. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=130.76000000000002s)]
*  The FTC appealed and the court rejected the agency's request to block the deal in the meantime. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=138.0s)]
*  In a statement, META said that the deal would bring pro-competitive benefits to the ecosystem. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=143.52s)]
*  Microsoft declined to comment. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=148.56s)]
*  Despite the losses, Kahn has said it's important to take those cases to court. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=150.28s)]
*  As public enforcers, we have a special obligation to be bringing the hard cases. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=154.4s)]
*  Because if you don't try, the message that sends out to the world is that the enforcers don't think there's a problem in the market. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=158.32s)]
*  Still, there's a risk in losing too much. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  It creates bad precedent for you. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=166.64s)]
*  And perhaps even Wall Street and companies start to kind of tune you out and think it's worth fighting you because you're not winning. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  Lawyers I've spoken to, they say maybe the FTC should take a step back and think more deeply about the kinds of deals that they want to bring that will make the points that Lena's trying to make. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=175.48s)]
*  In a statement, the agency said that in the last year and a half, the FTC has had 20 wins, including several mergers that were abandoned following FTC scrutiny. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=186.92s)]
*  The cases that Kahn's FTC has brought are not always straightforward. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=196.08s)]
*  Microsoft and Activision aren't direct competitors, so the agency needed the court to buy into its prediction that the merger could hurt competition in the future. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=199.96s)]
*  The courts have had mixed responses to that legal theory. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=208.36s)]
*  Lena says that over the last 30 odd years that the law came to put too much focus on what's called the consumer welfare standard, which is measuring harm from deals or from practices, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  measuring that in consumer prices or like supply output. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=224.44s)]
*  Lena disavows this consumer welfare standard is really the purpose of the antitrust laws. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  What Lena Kahn is doing is to put competition at the center of antitrust policy again and to say, actually, it's about this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=235.72s)]
*  This is this law is about whether you can let people into the market or not to compete. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  This approach is part of what got Kahn to the FTC. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=249.52s)]
*  The youngest FTC chair in history, she'd already made a name for herself by the time she was appointed. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=252.72s)]
*  After graduating from college, Kahn worked at a think tank where she looked at corporate consolidation. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=257.84s)]
*  It became clear pretty quickly that there had been a pretty steady trend of consolidation across the board. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=263.24s)]
*  And in 2017, she published an article titled Amazon's Antitrust Paradox when she was still in law school. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=270.04s)]
*  That paper reimagines the thrust of the antitrust laws. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=276.48s)]
*  She wants to think about antitrust enforcement and competitive harm in a much broader way. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=281.28s)]
*  She essentially said the way that we do business in America is essentially should be illegal. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=288.35999999999996s)]
*  Amazon declined to comment. That paper made her an antitrust celebrity. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=294.23999999999995s)]
*  She's a symbol of, you know, a new approach to addressing monopoly power. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=298.44s)]
*  She has come to prominence at a certain moment when technology plays a huge, huge role in our lives. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  And that's not going to change in the future. It's only going to get bigger. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=309.6s)]
*  When President Biden came into office, he made antitrust a big part of his agenda. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=312.96s)]
*  I'm a capitalist. But capitalism without competition is not capitalism. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=317.52s)]
*  Capitalism without competition is exploitation. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=323.48s)]
*  When he made her chair, it was an indication of policy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=326.44s)]
*  And that was a surprise to me. And I think it was a surprise to a lot of people. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=330.44s)]
*  President Biden thinks we have a monopoly crisis and that our monopoly crisis is a serious and core political economy issue that he wants to address and as part of his presidency. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=333.4s)]
*  But Khan's appointment was met with calls for her to recuse herself from cases involving companies she'd criticized in the past. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=344.88s)]
*  Facebook is seeking the recusal of FTC chair Lena Khan. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=351.2s)]
*  I have to tell you that Amazon is right when they say that they're entitled to impartial commissioners. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=355.28s)]
*  It's not a surprise that companies are going to throw everything that they have at the wall to see what sticks. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=362.12s)]
*  She didn't recuse herself from the Meadow within case despite an ethics officer's recommendation, prompting blowback. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=366.96s)]
*  There was no violation under the ethics laws because I have not a penny in financial stock. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=372.91999999999996s)]
*  Khan is under investigation by three Republican-led House committees for her leadership at the FTC. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=378.96s)]
*  The agency declined to comment. But criticism has come from within the agency, too. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=384.36s)]
*  Republican Commissioner Christine Wilson resigned in early 2023, accusing Khan of an abuse of power. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=389.08s)]
*  The commission, which is usually bipartisan, is now solely Democratic. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=395.08s)]
*  In a February statement, Khan and the other commissioners said that while they often disagreed with Wilson, they respect her devotion to her beliefs. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=399.28s)]
*  Khan has also faced employee discontent. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=407.28s)]
*  Lena Khan came in from the start and said that the FTC had done a lot of things wrong. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=410.0s)]
*  While that was appealing to her supporters, it was probably alienating to some of her staff and perhaps also to other former commissioners or other former chairs. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=415.88s)]
*  We are fortunate to have consummate professionals, extremely talented staff at the FTC. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=428.68s)]
*  Of course, we work hard to make sure that the FTC remains a great place to work. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=434.88s)]
*  But despite criticism and skepticism around her strategy, Khan says she isn't going anywhere. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=439.64s)]
*  My term goes until through 2024, and I fully intend to continue serving. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=445.32s)]
*  Including drafting aggressive new guidelines with the Justice Department on how the agency will investigate new mergers. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=450.32s)]
*  It doesn't seem like the FTC has a lot of time to change its strategy. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=456.76s)]
*  So Lena Khan has a relatively short window to accomplish as much as she can. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_0eiN53yM&t=461.2s)]
