# Anatomy of an IPO Valuation  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 03, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8)
*  Unicorns are getting haircuts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=0.0s)]
*  Unicorns are high-flying startups valued at over a billion dollars. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=3.52s)]
*  But these companies are seeing their valuation shrink when they go public. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=8.2s)]
*  Payment processor Square took a $3 billion IPO haircut in 2015. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=12.48s)]
*  Cloud computing company Domo took over $1.7 billion off the top in 2018. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=17.92s)]
*  And the latest high-profile haircut came this year from the Wee Company. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=24.32s)]
*  WeeWorks parent company got a virtual buzz cut, lowering its valuation by $32 billion [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=28.24s)]
*  before the company withdrew its IPO. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=33.96s)]
*  Private investors have infused these companies with cash, betting they have the potential to corner their markets. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=37.12s)]
*  Private valuations have become an accepted yardstick for what these companies are worth on the public market. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=43.72s)]
*  But many investors believe these valuations often overstate a firm's likely true worth. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=49.36s)]
*  Here's how that can happen. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  Private startup-seeking investments typically undergo a series of funding rounds, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  where investors, usually venture capital and private equity firms, provide cash in exchange for equity in the company. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  Each new round of fundraising sets a new valuation for the company. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  These valuations are usually based on several factors, including market size, revenue, and management. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=73.24s)]
*  Some investors and analysts contend that the entire process tends to carry a bias towards higher prices, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  because private markets are filled almost exclusively by investors who want their stakes to appreciate. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=85.24s)]
*  What makes private markets different is that they generally aren't subject to the skepticism that's common in public markets. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=92.16s)]
*  Private funding is fueled by optimism. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=99.16s)]
*  Private investors, unlike their public counterparts, typically are constrained in their ability to sell their stake in the company. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=102.36s)]
*  And they can't bet against the stock by selling it short. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=109.91999999999999s)]
*  There are a number of factors that often make private market valuations higher. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=113.2s)]
*  One popular way of enticing investors is to offer them preference shares, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=117.68s)]
*  securities that offer perks above and beyond the ownership stake conferred by common stock. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=122.4s)]
*  Preference shares are often sold to private-run investors and are more valuable than the common shares that are typically sold in an IPO, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=128.16s)]
*  which helps explain why private market valuations often end up higher than public market ones. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=136.52s)]
*  One common form of preference stock sold in early funding rounds comes with a liquidation preference, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=142.28s)]
*  which ensures investors can get back whatever they invested even if the company is sold at a lower valuation. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  A second preference stock feature, known as Ratchet, means early investors can get additional shares [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  if the company does an IPO at a lower price than the one at which they bought in. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=159.36s)]
*  But during evaluation, these higher share classes are valued equally to common stock, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=166.16000000000003s)]
*  even though they aren't entitled to the same payoffs, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=171.12s)]
*  making common stock appear more valuable than it actually is, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  bloating a company's valuation. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=177.96s)]
*  Square was valued at $6 billion after its last round of funding before going public. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=180.84s)]
*  But a study found that special promises to late-round investors had inflated this valuation. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  The study calculated Square was actually worth $2.2 billion, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  close to the $2.6 billion valuation the company received for its IPO. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=195.4s)]
*  A second reason for high valuations is that private companies aren't subject to the strict accounting practices [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=200.4s)]
*  that public companies must use. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=205.84s)]
*  They are far freer to present investors with non-standard data that paints a rosier picture of their financial health. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=207.52s)]
*  The We Company presented investors with a metric called community-adjusted EBITDA. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=213.76s)]
*  It excluded big expenses, including some rent costs that would usually be reported using generally accepted accounting principles. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=218.76s)]
*  In entering public markets, companies agree to report standard numbers based on rules set by the SEC. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=226.2s)]
*  This enables investors to more accurately compare different firms' finances. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=232.67999999999998s)]
*  Private market valuations can be a useful data point for investors. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=237.92s)]
*  But the rude awakening that firms like the We Company have received at times [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  is making many analysts and portfolio managers increasingly skeptical of those big numbers, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=245.92s)]
*  and forcing unicorns to take a little or a lot off the top. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ES391JdW8&t=251.44s)]
