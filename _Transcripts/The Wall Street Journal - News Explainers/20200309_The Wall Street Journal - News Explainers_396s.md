# How China Is Deploying Drones and Data to Tackle Coronavirus | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 09, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg)
*  This woman is being scolded for being outside without a face mask and was chased back into [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=0.0s)]
*  her home. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=9.24s)]
*  These people are being admonished for hanging out in a group. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=13.68s)]
*  They were all caught by Chinese authorities who've been deploying drones equipped with [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=17.96s)]
*  high-resolution cameras and loudspeakers. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  It's one part of China's massive surveillance strategy to tackle the spread of the coronavirus, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=26.6s)]
*  which has reached just about every region in the country. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  The virus has infected more than 80,000 in China, resulting in the deaths of more than [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=34.74s)]
*  2,000 people in the country, far surpassing the death toll from SARS. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=39.92s)]
*  The difference between 2003 and 2020 is really enormous in terms of the government's reliance [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=44.64s)]
*  on and development of surveillance technology. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=51.52s)]
*  None of these tools were on offer at that time. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=54.08s)]
*  Sophie Richardson is the China director at Human Rights Watch. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=58.32s)]
*  She says during this public health crisis, China is embarking on an unprecedented use [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=61.68s)]
*  of surveillance by using big data and its citizens. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=66.12s)]
*  So what exactly is China's surveillance strategy and can it work to battle the epidemic? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=71.68s)]
*  There are an estimated more than 300 million surveillance cameras in China, and authorities [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=81.36s)]
*  are using them to monitor Chinese citizens. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=86.6s)]
*  Many of the surveillance cameras in use in China now are equipped with facial recognition [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=89.48s)]
*  capabilities, which simply gives the authorities the ability to track who specifically has [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=93.12s)]
*  gone to which precise location. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  Combine that with data scraped from hospital records, police files and public transportation [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=101.28s)]
*  All that is stored and linked to national ID cards, which gives the Chinese government [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=107.32s)]
*  granular information about all its citizens. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  In January, a man who tested positive for the coronavirus used public buses and subways [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  to crisscross China's eastern city of Nanjing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=120.66s)]
*  The police posted his journey, with specific dates and times, on social media, with a warning [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=123.96s)]
*  that anyone who is in that area get tested for the virus. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=128.74s)]
*  China's public health authorities have been candid about the use of big data during this [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=133.6s)]
*  public health crisis. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=137.28s)]
*  They even developed a mobile phone app called the Close Contact Detector. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  The app has a database of people who have tested positive or have symptoms. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=150.72s)]
*  So as soon as you type in your name and national ID and log in, the app will tell you if you've [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=155.4s)]
*  ever come into close contact with someone who tested positive or if you're in the clear. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=160.84s)]
*  So far more than 200 million people have used the app. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=166.48s)]
*  These new and different uses of technology around the coronavirus may help resolve some [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=170.28s)]
*  of the public health concerns, but it's also another way for the government to gather large [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=178.0s)]
*  amounts of information about people really effectively without their consent and in some [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=184.16s)]
*  cases without even their knowledge. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=189.48s)]
*  Chinese health officials say all this data is in the pursuit of controlling the epidemic. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  In China, many people probably have not developed that kind of awareness in terms of protecting [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  the privacy, protecting the civil liberties. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=218.36s)]
*  Yanjuan Huang studies global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in the U.S. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=223.16s)]
*  He says many in China want this type of monitoring because it's about life or death. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=228.24s)]
*  And when they were given the choices of protecting their health and protecting the civil liberties, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=232.96s)]
*  you know, probably would choose the former even to the detriment of the latter. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=240.28s)]
*  Huang says increasing population control during a health crisis can be a slippery slope. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=247.08s)]
*  This widespread use of surveillance technologies may also encourage the use of the same technologies, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  surveillance techniques, even after the outbreak, you know, for purposes may not be really justifiable. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  People are also a big part of its surveillance apparatus. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=272.8s)]
*  After all, President Xi Jinping said the fight against the virus was a people's war. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  Authorities send out text messages telling people to go directly to authorities if they [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=280.76s)]
*  come from Hubei province where the coronavirus first emerged. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  And announcements are posted all around town encouraging everyone to monitor each other. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=289.8s)]
*  Police patrol streets telling people without face masks to go home. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=296.48s)]
*  And managers of apartment complexes go door to door to check on residents' health conditions. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=300.76s)]
*  This may sort of suggest this revival of this cultural revolution year when you saw these [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=306.8s)]
*  people monitor their neighbors, you know, even their relatives. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=315.68s)]
*  Some provinces have started giving an incentive to monitor family members' travel histories and health. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  In Sichuan province in Western China, snitching can snag you as much as 5,000 yuan. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=331.28s)]
*  That's roughly equivalent to a monthly salary that's more than minimum wage. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=339.76s)]
*  One government in Guangdong province is offering 30 face masks in exchange for snitch reports. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=344.0s)]
*  During this public health crisis, China hasn't been the only country to use technology to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=351.0s)]
*  track patients. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=355.2s)]
*  In South Korea, health authorities are legally allowed to sift through credit card records, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=356.8s)]
*  CCTV footage and mobile phone locations to pin down the travel histories of those infected [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=361.24s)]
*  or at risk. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  That information is then shared with the public. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=368.48s)]
*  In China's surveillance state, not only do authorities have access to more data than [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=371.24s)]
*  other governments, but citizens have no way to opt out of that data collection. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=375.68s)]
*  Beijing says all this is in the best interest of the public. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=381.04s)]
*  You'll have to be able to see how the virus ultimately played out, who was affected, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=384.92s)]
*  who wasn't, whether the surveillance technology helped. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awfoSQ0mVGg&t=389.28000000000003s)]
