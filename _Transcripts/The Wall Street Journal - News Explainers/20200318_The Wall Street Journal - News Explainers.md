# How a Political Ad Evolves as It Moves Around America  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 18, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0)
*  Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=0.0s)]
*  These are two of Senator Bernie Sanders' political TV advertisements. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=2.16s)]
*  At first glance, seemingly the same. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=6.08s)]
*  And so is the solution. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=8.32s)]
*  The one on the left first aired in Iowa in November last year. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=9.32s)]
*  And the other on the right first aired in North Dakota [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=12.92s)]
*  the day after former Vice President Joe Biden [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=15.56s)]
*  swept a string of Southern states on Super Tuesday. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=18.0s)]
*  Bernie Sanders. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=21.12s)]
*  Notice the difference? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=22.68s)]
*  The most recent version included images of African Americans. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=24.12s)]
*  But the one on the left that first aired more than four months earlier did not. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=28.0s)]
*  Making subtle changes to the same ad is common practice [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=32.92s)]
*  with some of the presidential campaigns. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=36.16s)]
*  And like others we tracked, this Bernie Sanders ad called [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=38.72s)]
*  Belong to Us saw at least six different changes [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=41.84s)]
*  as it moved through the campaign calendar. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=45.24s)]
*  Using political ad tracker Kantar CMAG [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=49.72s)]
*  along with Facebook and Google's transparency reports [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=52.32s)]
*  we tracked some of the candidates' ads to see how they evolved over the campaign cycle. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=55.2s)]
*  A good political ad is a mix of artistry, math and science. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=61.64s)]
*  Steve Israel served in Congress for 16 years. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  For four of those years he was the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=70.56s)]
*  and part of his job was to make sure political ads resonated in specific markets. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  He is now the director of Cornell University's Institute of Politics and Global Affairs [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=80.2s)]
*  and teaches a course that includes dissecting political advertising. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  An effective political ad has to have several components. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  One, it's got to be local. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=92.84s)]
*  It's got to have music that reflects local sensibilities. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  The characters have to project a certain tone. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=99.4s)]
*  A hard-driving, aggressive New Yorker is not going to do well [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  endorsing a congresswoman from Iowa in that media market. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=106.36000000000001s)]
*  And most important, it's got to reflect data. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=109.68s)]
*  It's got to be driven not by what some producer or a candidate thinks will work [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=113.76s)]
*  but by what the voters themselves tell you. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  When we started tracking the ads we focused on some of the top candidates [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  and also included President Trump. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=125.0s)]
*  What we found is that not all of the campaigns actually had different versions of the same ad. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=127.12s)]
*  One of the reasons you repackage ads is to save money. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=132.16s)]
*  So when you're not bound by a tight campaign budget you can just create new ones. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  According to Kantar CMAG and data from Google and Facebook [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=139.96s)]
*  Michael Bloomberg spent at least $590 million on advertising [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=143.48s)]
*  over the course of the presidential primary race [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=147.72s)]
*  and had no different versions of the same ad. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=150.48s)]
*  Despite spending significantly less money [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  both Senator Elizabeth Warren and President Trump [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=155.76s)]
*  appear to have no variations of the same ad. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=158.2s)]
*  Tom Steyer, another billionaire in the race [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=161.32s)]
*  appeared to only have one ad that had different versions. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=163.44s)]
*  Both Biden and former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=166.6s)]
*  appeared to change several of their ads but had fewer versions than others. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=169.4s)]
*  Out of all the ads we tracked it was Sanders and Senator Amy Klobuchar [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=173.44s)]
*  who made the most changes. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  We asked the campaigns about their strategy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=178.72s)]
*  Warren's team chose not to comment [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  and while we didn't hear back from the campaigns of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=182.8s)]
*  Biden, Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Trump [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=184.76s)]
*  the Bloomberg team told us that having a large budget [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  gave them the freedom to create new ads for each market. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  The Steyer campaign told us that the changes were made with no specific intent [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  and the Sanders campaign said that they tailor ads to local markets. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  We picked out several differences among the ads we tracked. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  We then had Israel watch some of them and analyse how the ads evolved [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=207.92s)]
*  as they followed the candidate on the campaign trail. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=211.64s)]
*  OK, I'm looking at one. Bernie Sanders, what happens? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  Those are the people that I will represent. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  No more tax breaks for billionaires. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  We're going to fight. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=221.16s)]
*  You do see in the right-hand margin of the California frame [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=222.32s)]
*  cleverly a little snippet of the California state flag. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=227.44s)]
*  It's all about local flavouring. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=231.36s)]
*  You cannot influence people when you have a boilerplate ad [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  that is not going to resonate locally. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=241.52s)]
*  Across all the changes we noticed, the majority reflected the locality [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=245.12s)]
*  of where the ad was aired. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=249.0s)]
*  As you continue to watch the California ad, you're seeing more. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=250.4s)]
*  So it's now pulling out away from that one woman. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=254.28s)]
*  Now we see diversity in this frame. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=256.96s)]
*  We see a young man. We still see young people. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=260.52s)]
*  It's a mostly youthful crowd, which tells me that they're really trying [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=263.4s)]
*  to create this narrative that this is not an old candidate, an old campaign. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=267.28s)]
*  We have the support of the people. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=270.91999999999996s)]
*  And what people do we have the support of? Young people. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  In Sanders's ad campaign called Growing Up, he used hospitality workers [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  in the California and North Carolina ad, but showed factory workers [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=281.32s)]
*  in the Iowa and Nevada versions. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=285.6s)]
*  Also in the North Carolina version, they added civil rights [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=288.68s)]
*  as one of the important issues for his campaign. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  What this is telling us is that in focus groups or in polling, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=294.6s)]
*  with the demographic that Senator Sanders was trying to attract [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=298.24s)]
*  in a Super Tuesday primary, civil rights was a big deal. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=302.12s)]
*  And so he chose to accentuate civil rights. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=306.20000000000005s)]
*  If only for a few quick seconds, he chose to include that very graphic image [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=308.76000000000005s)]
*  in order to create a bond, a connection to those voters [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=315.6s)]
*  who who care deeply about the issue. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=319.24s)]
*  While Joe Biden had fewer versions of the same ad, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=322.32s)]
*  we also saw his campaign cater to the local market in South Carolina. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=325.0s)]
*  The former vice president would go on to win the state's primary [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=329.88s)]
*  with strong support from its African-American voters. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=333.16s)]
*  You are seeing people, real people, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=336.32s)]
*  authentic people relating to Joe Biden in South Carolina with t-shirts [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=339.24s)]
*  that everybody knows came from South Carolina in a gym [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=343.96s)]
*  that is in South Carolina. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=348.03999999999996s)]
*  And the US framing could be almost anywhere in the country. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=349.76s)]
*  And those demographics are generally chosen strategically. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=352.96s)]
*  100 days, 100 ways. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  With Facebook versions of the candidates ads, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=359.35999999999996s)]
*  we mainly saw just changes to the size and other small tweaks [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=361.56s)]
*  to make them work better on social platforms. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=365.28s)]
*  However, on Google's YouTube, we noticed some subtle differences [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=367.67999999999995s)]
*  in Sanders' growing up ad. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=371.4s)]
*  You're you're seeing a digital ad. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  You're seeing this tight shot of Bernie Sanders with his head kind of slumped. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=375.6s)]
*  If you're watching a digital ad, you are engaged. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=380.6s)]
*  You have no choice when a campaign commercial [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=384.64s)]
*  interrupts your television preferences. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=388.44s)]
*  Take a look at it. Bernie Sanders shoulders. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=391.96000000000004s)]
*  Right. Like, why that? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=395.48s)]
*  Because this guy has your problems on his shoulders. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=397.16s)]
*  That's what this tells me. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=400.6s)]
*  And I may be reading too much into it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=401.52s)]
*  So far this cycle, it's yet to be seen what new techniques [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  might be used in the political digital advertising space. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=406.96s)]
*  But with sophisticated political campaign companies [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=410.4s)]
*  like Michael Bloomberg's Hawkefish vowing to use its resources [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=413.2s)]
*  for the Democratic presidential nominee, experts are watching closely. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=416.44s)]
*  So if you are living in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CqFSqBL8E0&t=421.12s)]
