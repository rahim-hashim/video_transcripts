# Trump Takes Lead Over Harris in Closing Weeks of 2024 Race, WSJ Poll Finds | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ)
*  A new poll from the Wall Street Journal has found that Donald Trump has opened up a lead [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=0.0s)]
*  over Kamala Harris. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=3.68s)]
*  He's leading her by about two percentage points, which is a change from our last poll, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=4.96s)]
*  which had her up by two percentage points. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=9.76s)]
*  What this essentially means is in the final weeks of the campaign, when the candidates [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=11.92s)]
*  are really trying to make their closing arguments to voters, Donald Trump appears to be having [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=15.72s)]
*  the momentum, putting Kamala Harris on her back foot in the closing days of the race. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=19.5s)]
*  We've been asking people in our poll, what do you think about the job Donald Trump did [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=24.28s)]
*  when he was president since he left office? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=30.6s)]
*  And in our most recent poll, he notched his highest rating yet at 52%. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=33.28s)]
*  Some of the top issues that voters care about, immigration, the economy, crime. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump already had an advantage over Harris on those issues, but our new poll found [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=43.52s)]
*  that he had expanded his lead. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  Something that we hear from voters when we're on the campaign trail that might help illuminate [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=51.8s)]
*  that finding is people say that they just feel like they were better off when Donald [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=55.32s)]
*  Trump was president, or they feel like the economy was heading in a better direction. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=60.059999999999995s)]
*  And it's notable that this is coming right in the final days of the race, where ballots [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=64.28s)]
*  are just being mailed in, early voting is still going on. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=68.56s)]
*  So it's a good sign for him that voters are recalling his presidency in favorable terms, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=71.84s)]
*  the most favorable terms that we've seen in our poll. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=76.6s)]
*  Another big thing that stood out to me that might explain Trump's momentum is that Kamala [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=79.48s)]
*  Harris's approval rating appears to be going down. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=84.28s)]
*  Voters when we talk to them anecdotally and also in public polling still don't seem to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=88.76s)]
*  really understand exactly what she stands for and why. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=93.64s)]
*  And it's something that the Trump campaign has tried to exploit by linking her to some [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=96.98s)]
*  of the more unpopular policy positions advanced by her boss, President Biden. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=101.06s)]
*  Kamala Harris can't say one thing that she'd do differently from sleepy Joe Biden. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=105.92s)]
*  Not one thing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=112.04s)]
*  And a really good example of Trump and his allies trying to yoke Harris to the Biden [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=113.04s)]
*  administration is on immigration. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=119.12s)]
*  Trump has basically championed this issue, not just in this campaign, but in his previous [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=121.44s)]
*  ones. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=126.36s)]
*  And it's something where voters seem to give him the edge. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=127.36s)]
*  She should resign and disgrace for what she's done to our country, not run for president. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=129.44s)]
*  She was the border guard. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  And the fact that we're seeing her favorability and her job approval as vice president go [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  down will suggest to me that Donald Trump has an edge in defining his opponent at a [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=142.36s)]
*  time where she really wants to define herself. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=148.12s)]
*  Abortion is the one issue that we tested where Harris had a clear advantage over Trump. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=151.32s)]
*  And when we asked voters who was mentally up to the job, Harris also had an edge over [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=155.28s)]
*  Trump on that question too. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=159.56s)]
*  Who's the change agent? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=161.92s)]
*  Who's the candidate that voters feel like will take the country forward? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  Is it the former president who's already been elected? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=168.6s)]
*  Or is it the incumbent vice president who people get to judge her on her performance [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=171.2s)]
*  right now? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=174.92s)]
*  And we put that question to voters in our poll and overwhelmingly they said that Donald [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=175.92s)]
*  Trump was the change agent. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=180.64s)]
*  With less than two weeks to go, you'll likely see Donald Trump continue to try to press [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=182.16s)]
*  his advantage where he's strongest on the economy and immigration. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=186.2s)]
*  President Kamala Harris tried to peel away those undecided voters and get her base to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=190.84s)]
*  turn out in the swing states by continuing to portray Donald Trump as mentally unstable [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=194.54s)]
*  and also a threat to abortion rights. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=203.72s)]
*  But this race is still incredibly close and who wins will likely come down to how those [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=211.36s)]
*  undecided voters break. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKfUvu0uDQ&t=215.48000000000002s)]
