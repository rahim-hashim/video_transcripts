# Why Elon Musk and His Tech Allies Want Trump to Win Now  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o)
*  In the final weeks of the presidential election, Elon Musk has become one of former President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's most powerful allies. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=8.52s)]
*  I'm not just mega, I'm dog gothic mega. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=11.0s)]
*  It's a stark change from 2015, when he told Vanity Fair that Trump winning the nomination. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that wouldn't be good. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  While Vice President Kamala Harris has broad support in Silicon Valley, Musk is part of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=23.6s)]
*  a small group of tech leaders and investors that have become more supportive of Trump [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=28.92s)]
*  over the last eight years. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=34.04s)]
*  As they see it, Trump's Republican Party is [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=36.04s)]
*  More welcoming of bold ideas and what we call kind of American dynamism. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=38.72s)]
*  I think if these big names are coming out in support of Donald Trump, but also opening [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=43.6s)]
*  their pocketbooks, that could have lasting effects on any election. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=48.56s)]
*  Here's the philosophy, policies and relationships behind the shift. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  And what it means for Silicon Valley and the election. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=57.2s)]
*  To understand the move to the right, you have to start here with some tech leaders that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  were part of a group known as the PayPal Mafia. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  It's a collection of former employees and founders of PayPal, many of which have gone [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  on to build some of tech's most influential companies. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=74.2s)]
*  They're very well connected in the Valley. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=77.56s)]
*  These are people that are considered thought leaders in the tech space. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=79.56s)]
*  This group varies on politics. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=82.5s)]
*  People lean Democratic, like Reid Hoffman, one of Harris's biggest supporters this year. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=85.08s)]
*  She, growing up through California, saw all the positives about entrepreneurship and technology. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=90.36s)]
*  But Peter Thiel has long been an unorthodox voice in Silicon Valley. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=95.4s)]
*  He has called himself a conservative libertarian and was close with controversial blogger Curtis [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=99.52s)]
*  Yarvin, who refers to himself as a neo-monarchist. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=104.24s)]
*  You'll notice that everything you have that works was made in a monarchy or by a monarchy [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=108.28s)]
*  or both. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=114.16s)]
*  So for example, this iPhone. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=115.16s)]
*  This iPhone was produced by Apple, which is a monarchy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=117.8s)]
*  That is, it's a corporation. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  Core to both Yarvin and Thiel's politics is a conviction that political and economic [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=123.12s)]
*  systems are bloated, inefficient, and in need of radical reform. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=128.32s)]
*  I still think there is a lot that one could do by deregulating, having a less severely [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=133.04s)]
*  regulated economy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=140.44s)]
*  The PayPal mafia's circle of influence steadily expanded, connecting them with other leaders [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=142.12s)]
*  in the sector. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=147.12s)]
*  One of those connections was Shervin Peshavar, a venture capitalist who worked on Hyperloop [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  with Musk. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=152.88s)]
*  I think this is a tech-centered, centrist movement, and we're techno-optimists. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=153.88s)]
*  During the Obama administration, Silicon Valley flourished, thanks in part to government support. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=159.6s)]
*  Every time I come to Silicon Valley, every time I come to this region, I am excited about [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=165.68s)]
*  America's future. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=170.96s)]
*  People like President Obama really held up big tech as these bastions of innovation, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=172.12s)]
*  of job creation, as these homegrown places that we should really celebrate. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  Peshavar participated in tech roundtables and served on the Fulbright board in the Obama [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=181.0s)]
*  administration. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  When I was working on Hyperloop, one of the first people I pitched it to was President [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  Obama. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=191.28s)]
*  Areas of support that President Obama gave towards innovation, it was great. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=192.28s)]
*  But the ground started to shift in 2016. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=197.12s)]
*  Though many Silicon Valley leaders backed Hillary Clinton, Teal stood apart from his [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=200.32s)]
*  colleagues as one of few to publicly endorse Trump. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=204.64s)]
*  I'm not a politician, but neither is Donald Trump. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=208.16s)]
*  So when Peter Teal came out in support of Donald Trump, which was not really a popular [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  thing to do, it kind of gave legitimacy to supporting Trump. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=216.62s)]
*  In the 2020 election, the communications and electronics sector, which includes many but [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  not all tech companies, donated a record amount of money to Democratic candidates and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=226.36s)]
*  PACs. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  But at the same time, Trump garnered more support from Silicon Valley leaders than he [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  did in 2016, including his future vice presidential candidate, J.D. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=236.8s)]
*  Vance. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=241.24s)]
*  Vance previously worked with Teal. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=242.24s)]
*  I tend to think that we should seize the institutions of the left and turn them against the left. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=244.24s)]
*  We need like a debathification program, but like a de-woke-ification program in the United [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=249.08s)]
*  States. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  The tension was growing between Musk and Democrats. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=255.6s)]
*  The more progressive wing of the party, people like Elizabeth Warren, sort of made him the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=258.08s)]
*  face of corporate greed. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=261.52s)]
*  The world's richest freeloader evidently has a very thin skin. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=262.76s)]
*  Another pain point for Musk was a series of EV events held by the White House. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=268.44s)]
*  The Biden administration has been very pro-union and Musk is famously anti-union. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=272.92s)]
*  So when the White House would have these big EV summits or Joe Biden would talk about the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=278.76s)]
*  EV revolution, Elon was never mentioned. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=284.0s)]
*  Didn't mention Tesla once and praised Jim and Ford for leading the EV revolution. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=286.4s)]
*  So you were pissed. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=293.2s)]
*  Does this sound maybe a little biased? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=294.2s)]
*  Biden's administration also cracked down on big tech and worked on regulations around [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=297.2s)]
*  crypto and AI. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  There was a very anti-crypto stance and that had a very negative impact on the industry. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=303.64s)]
*  A lot of companies got fined and hurt. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=310.96s)]
*  Some of them feel like they can't get mergers done or that these policies are overreaching [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  and hurting innovation. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=319.32s)]
*  Other Biden administration policies, Peshavar said drove him to support Trump included the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=321.32s)]
*  handling of Iran, fiscal policy and what he sees as different attitudes about free speech. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=326.52s)]
*  The Democrats are talking about filtering people's ability to express themselves on [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=332.56s)]
*  the internet. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=337.52s)]
*  That's the opposite, the antithesis of what people on the more centrist conservative [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=338.52s)]
*  side believe in. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=344.4s)]
*  Musk has expressed similar concerns. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=345.76s)]
*  Free speech is important for a healthy democracy. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=348.56s)]
*  It is important. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=352.12s)]
*  Still, in 2022, Musk expressed doubts about Trump. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=353.12s)]
*  In July of that year, the Tesla CEO wrote on X, I don't hate the man, but it's time [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  for Trump to hang up his hat and sail into the sunset. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  Behind the scenes, Musk was already donating to Republican causes and candidates. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=365.48s)]
*  We found that Musk has been setting up dark money vehicles to funnel his funds. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=370.2s)]
*  One of them was Stephen Miller's organization and an ad campaign called Citizens for Sanity. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=375.52s)]
*  These ads were considered controversial. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=381.08s)]
*  They attacked Democratic candidates for being woke, for transgender policies, for illegal [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=383.12s)]
*  immigration. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=389.84s)]
*  And for a while, who was behind these ads was a giant mystery. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=390.84s)]
*  But we found out that he was behind that. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=395.14s)]
*  In 2023, Musk was secretly behind Governor Ron DeSantis' run for presidential election, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=397.46s)]
*  which makes this election cycle all the more fascinating because he's not only in support [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=403.9s)]
*  of Donald Trump this election cycle, who was not his first pick for president, but he created [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=408.38s)]
*  a super PAC in order to help his reelection chances. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=412.5s)]
*  As of October 28th, Musk had donated over $118 million to his America PAC. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=415.58s)]
*  Donations to Trump have flowed in from multiple corners. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=421.66s)]
*  In June, Pichavar hosted a fundraiser with David Sacks. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=425.22s)]
*  The event raised $12 million. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=428.46000000000004s)]
*  I think everyone came away with the impression that he's a true patriot who loves America [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=430.82000000000005s)]
*  and loves Americans and believes in American exceptionalism. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=436.26000000000005s)]
*  In October, America PAC began offering $47 to those who referred registered voters to [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=441.3s)]
*  sign a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=447.1s)]
*  And Musk started speaking about a potential role in the Trump administration. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=450.66s)]
*  Assuming that President Trump is willing, and I think he is, I intend to play a significant [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=454.5s)]
*  role in making government efficient. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=461.02000000000004s)]
*  Watching Elon become more politically engaged has been, I think, exhilarating for many of [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=467.42s)]
*  us because he is the greatest engineer ever and he's one of the greatest entrepreneurs [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=473.18s)]
*  in human history. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=481.62s)]
*  Democrats are still overwhelmingly winning support from the communications and electronics [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=483.14s)]
*  sector. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=488.14s)]
*  Tech leaders like Mark Cuban are also hitting the road on Harris's campaign, speaking against [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=489.14s)]
*  Trump. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=493.86s)]
*  Now his trade policies, particularly with tariffs, are basically just gibberish. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=494.86s)]
*  Harris has also brought back some of the support that the party lost under Biden. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=499.3s)]
*  Venture capitalist Ben Horowitz, for example, posted on X that he would be donating to both [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQLhtlHO1o&t=503.42s)]
