# The Ambiguous Word That Can Legally Bulldoze Neighborhoods | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs)
*  If you think of blight, you probably don't picture something like this parking garage. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=0.0s)]
*  But New York considers it blighted. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=5.36s)]
*  That's because blight is a word with more than just a negative connotation. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=7.9s)]
*  It has the power to unlock billions of dollars for [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=12.44s)]
*  real estate development by opening the door for governments to seize private property for public use. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=15.44s)]
*  Just look at New York's $40 billion plan for Penn Station, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=22.28s)]
*  or LA's $2 billion Angels Landing Project. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=26.159999999999997s)]
*  Even Seattle's famous Pike Place was transformed from this to this on the basis of blight. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=30.04s)]
*  It can be the basis for deciding that the area should be condemned and redeveloped. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=37.12s)]
*  But these redevelopment projects don't hinge on the same interpretation of blight, just the word. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  Here's why blight is so tough to define, how it's used to redevelop cities, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=48.84s)]
*  and why its use is a source of heated debate. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=53.64s)]
*  Blight has been blamed for increasing crime, drug use, and unsanitary conditions in neighborhoods across the country. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=58.44s)]
*  But the standard isn't the same across every legal code. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=65.44s)]
*  Take Pittsburgh as an example. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=69.32s)]
*  Here, blight could be a building used for an immoral purpose. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  In Columbus, Kansas, foot tall weeds check the box. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=75.52s)]
*  In Washington state, being a menace to the public was the rationale used to classify this motel as blighted in 2015. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=79.88s)]
*  What is your standard that you use to determine blight? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=88.36s)]
*  Blight is a difficult term to define precisely because it's used in a lot of different ways. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=92.36s)]
*  Amy Levine specializes in land use and municipal law. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=98.92s)]
*  She has exceptional knowledge in the area of eminent domain and was integral in drafting our legislation. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=102.4s)]
*  In general, it's used to identify the land that should be part of a redevelopment area. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=108.72s)]
*  And once land is identified as blighted, the stage is set for eminent domain, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=114.44s)]
*  giving the government the power to seize the property. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=120.0s)]
*  If the government needs to build a school or build a road, they can go in and they can take property from private property owners [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=123.2s)]
*  and then use it to provide those public purposes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=131.24s)]
*  New York and the agency in charge of the Penn Station project, Empire State Development, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=134.4s)]
*  are using eminent domain after deeming these blocks as blighted, the conclusion of a neighborhood study in the spring of 2020. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  Some of what Empire State Development called blighted includes this building with its missing windows, cracked curbs and ADA inaccessibility. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  This white storefront was sited for its stained windows, scaffolding and cracked sidewalks. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=157.56s)]
*  Empire State Development needs to meet certain conditions to be involved in a project, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=163.67999999999998s)]
*  and they do that by making a finding that the property is substandard and insanitary. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=169.32s)]
*  Then the state can slate the buildings for redevelopment using eminent domain. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  This Penn Station development is crucial for us. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=180.2s)]
*  On these eight lots, the state is proposing new skyscrapers, which it says will help fund major improvements to Penn Station, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=184.27999999999997s)]
*  as well as cosmetic upgrades like cleaning up these drains and the stained walls. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=191.68s)]
*  But governments across the US have used eminent domain for decades. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  Just look at Seattle. In the late 1950s, city officials started declaring neighborhoods blighted and began redevelopment. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  Your city is engaged in dramatically revitalizing several of our older neighborhoods. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  Some residents said blight designations targeted low income neighborhoods and minorities. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=215.16s)]
*  That project faced opposition back when it started. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=220.64s)]
*  In a letter, one resident called it grossly unfair. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=223.96s)]
*  And almost 60 years later, Seattle passed a resolution on how the forced acquisition of a church property, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=227.12s)]
*  which occurred as part of that project, hurt the local black community. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=233.48s)]
*  Today, that land is part of a city park. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=237.6s)]
*  A lot of people think that urban renewal is over and not still happening. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=240.48s)]
*  And so they call them different things. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=244.92s)]
*  In the case of Barclay Center or Penn Station, it's economic redevelopment. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=247.24s)]
*  And relocation still occurs. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=253.52s)]
*  These are all the businesses that might be displaced by the Penn Station project. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  It's a main reason why some people living and working in the Penn Station area are opposed, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=260.44s)]
*  although relocated residents are given just compensation or fair market value for their property. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=265.8s)]
*  I think people do, in a lot of cases, get the sense that the basis for the condemnation is a little bit subjective. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=272.48s)]
*  Residents in the Penn area are responding in similar ways as Seattle residents, 80 years later. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=280.92s)]
*  One lawyer even filed a lawsuit to urge New York to disclose communications with real estate developer Vornado, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=287.04s)]
*  the largest private stakeholder in the project. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=293.68s)]
*  One watchdog group estimated that Vornado may receive up to $1.2 billion in subsidies during the project. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  Vornado declined to comment. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=303.92s)]
*  Empire State Development said that Hockel's proposal is what New Yorkers and Penn Station deserve. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=306.56s)]
*  So the main part of the lawsuit, it is about the issue of blight. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=312.36s)]
*  The way the law is set up doesn't make it particularly easy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=316.52s)]
*  A government's ability to use blight to seize property has been challenged in the past. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=319.72s)]
*  One case even reached the Supreme Court in 2005, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=325.08000000000004s)]
*  which held that governments can take property for the purpose of promoting economic development. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=328.88s)]
*  Economic development is a traditional and long accepted function of government. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=334.32s)]
*  As construction begins in the Penn Station area, so will the legal cases against it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZwf8EalUs&t=339.36s)]
