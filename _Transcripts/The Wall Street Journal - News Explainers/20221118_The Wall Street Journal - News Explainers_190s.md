# FTX’s Collapse The Three Key Points on the Largest Crypto Bankruptcy Ever  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM)
*  The collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX has rattled the crypto world and set off a scramble to find billions of missing dollars. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=0.0s)]
*  And to make things even more complicated, cryptocurrency exchanges are so new that bankruptcy courts haven't yet had to sort out complex legal questions surrounding their collapse. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=7.76s)]
*  So here are three things to know about FTX's bankruptcy case. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=17.44s)]
*  First, there's a growing jurisdiction battle over where bankruptcy proceedings should take place, the US or the Bahamas. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=22.16s)]
*  On November 11th, the day that FTX founder Sam Bankman Fried resigned, FTX and more than 130 corporate affiliates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  But the Bahamas government appears to be challenging that venue. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=39.6s)]
*  On November 15th, a Bahamas court-appointed liquidator filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in New York on behalf of FTX Digital Markets. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=43.28s)]
*  And he essentially asked to move some of the legal proceedings to the Bahamas. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=51.6s)]
*  He argued that the Bahamas has jurisdiction over FTX Digital and other entities that were operated by SBF out of a huge office complex in Nassau. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=55.76s)]
*  It's not uncommon for the Bahamas to oversee the bankruptcy of a Bahamas-based company, but FTX's new leaders have criticized the move, calling it a blatant attempt to avoid the supervision of the court in Delaware and keep the FTX subsidiary in the Bahamas isolated from the rest of the company. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=64.8s)]
*  They argue that all the proceedings should take place in a single bankruptcy court, the one in Delaware, so that the company can secure its assets. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=81.52s)]
*  A hearing over the venue dispute is scheduled for Monday. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=88.96s)]
*  Speaking of FTX's new management, it looks like we'll be hearing a lot from John J. Ray. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=92.0s)]
*  He's the new FTX CEO, and he has unwound Enron and other major corporate failures. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=97.12s)]
*  He has already become a key figure in the proceedings, and he drove headlines with the court filing on Thursday. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=102.96s)]
*  In it, he pointed out that he has over 40 years of legal and restructuring experience, and that never in his career had he seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  The filing went on to paint a picture of FTX's chaotic finances. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=122.55999999999999s)]
*  And regarding the balance sheets of FTX and its subsidiaries, Ray repeatedly said, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  I do not have confidence in them. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  An email sent to Bankman Freed for comment bounced back. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=134.0s)]
*  FTX's new management is now scrambling to figure out just how much money the company even has. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=137.28s)]
*  So what does this all mean for customers? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=143.44s)]
*  There are still a lot of unknowns. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=145.44s)]
*  This is the largest collapse of a cryptocurrency exchange ever, and it's being handled by a bankruptcy system that hasn't yet figured out crypto. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  Legal experts say that's because this issue is so new, the courts haven't yet had a chance to decide complex legal issues. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=155.68s)]
*  Like the question of who owns digital currencies. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=162.48s)]
*  Is it the cryptocurrency exchange or the customer who made a deposit? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=165.04s)]
*  FTX has said that the number of creditors in bankruptcy could top one million. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  Legal experts say it'll probably be a long time before FTX customers have a better idea of what they'll get back, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  and what legal recourse, if any, they may have against SBF and others that reportedly knew of the misuse of FTX customer funds. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCM-agH1aGM&t=179.44s)]
