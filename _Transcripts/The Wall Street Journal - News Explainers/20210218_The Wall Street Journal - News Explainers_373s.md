# What Regulators Are Looking Into With the GameStop Frenzy | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 18, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg)
*  The January trading frenzy of certain stocks has come under intense scrutiny as legislators, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=0.0s)]
*  regulators, and others try to understand what drove the rapid rise and fall of these securities. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  GameStop shares in particular surged from about $20 to $483 over two weeks in January. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=11.36s)]
*  The price has since fallen to around $45. The Securities and Exchange Commission is [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=18.0s)]
*  reviewing the volatility. The Department of Justice has launched a probe, and the Commodity [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=23.36s)]
*  Futures Trading Commission has opened a preliminary investigation into certain circumstances of the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=28.08s)]
*  rally. Also, the House Financial Services Committee is reviewing if the actions of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  brokerages in online communities require more oversight. Central to these lines of inquiry [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=37.36s)]
*  are questions of market manipulation and the actions brokerages took in response to the rally. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=42.56s)]
*  But understanding whether these actions cross the line takes time and isn't always easy to determine. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=48.0s)]
*  The market manipulation in a nutshell is a scheme to create some kind of an artificial price. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=53.52s)]
*  So you can do that different ways. There are different tactics that traders can use to try [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=63.2s)]
*  to artificially pump up the price of the stock and then benefit by selling into this sort of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=69.76s)]
*  frenzy that they've created. Dave Michaels covers white-collar crime and financial enforcement for [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=77.04s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal and says market manipulation schemes have been going on as long as there's been [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=82.08s)]
*  a market. Some are quite time-tested, meaning they've been going on for a long time and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=86.48s)]
*  regulators know the recipe and they know sort of the telltale signs. A well-known example of market [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=92.0s)]
*  manipulation is the Stratton-Oakmont pump-and-dump scheme of the early 90s. Dramatized in the movie [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=98.0s)]
*  The Wolf of Wall Street, it involved convincing investors to bet large sums of money on a stock, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=104.08s)]
*  inflating the price before Stratton brokers sold shares held by the firm and its partners. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=108.8s)]
*  What this trade will do is serve as a benchmark for future business, Kevin. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  Do you feel comfortable with me now, Scott? Kerry Curtis Axel is a former assistant U.S. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=118.0s)]
*  attorney and former staff attorney at the SEC. Your typical market manipulation case involves [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=122.32s)]
*  false statements by people who somehow want to manipulate the stock price for their own gain. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  That's your typical kind of pump-and-dump scheme. These false statements can come in the form of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  brokers pushing inflated financial outlooks or bad actors publishing press releases with outlandish [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=138.4s)]
*  claims of business breakthroughs. Some commentators have said individuals coordinating on Reddit, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=143.68s)]
*  largely in the Wall Street Bets Forum, openly engaged in a pump-and-dump scheme to inflate [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=148.32s)]
*  the price of GameStop and other securities. These allegations have not come from regulators or law [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=152.96s)]
*  enforcement. The CFTC is looking into whether misconduct occurred as Reddit traders targeted [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=158.4s)]
*  silver futures in the largest exchange-traded fund tied to silver, the iShare Silver Trust. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=163.84s)]
*  But in an anonymous public forum like Reddit, determining the identity of users and whether [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=169.76s)]
*  their posts were intended to deceive others may not be so clear-cut. The SEC is a law enforcement [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=174.24s)]
*  agency and it can seek records from Reddit that would reveal the people behind these usernames. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=180.08s)]
*  They would do that by sending a subpoena for records to Reddit and Reddit could agree to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=187.28s)]
*  comply with the subpoena and just hand the records over. On the other hand, there are some limitations [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  that the SEC places, frankly on itself, in terms of subpoenaing news agencies or news media. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=201.76s)]
*  One question may be, is Reddit sort of operating, in a sense, as a news site? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=210.56s)]
*  And could it put up a First Amendment argument against the subpoena? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=218.72s)]
*  Actions taken by brokerages have also caught the attention of regulators. The SEC's Acting Chair, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=223.52s)]
*  Allison Lee, told NPR that the agency is also looking into whether decisions to curb trading [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=229.2s)]
*  at the peak of the frenzy complied with regulations. And specifically, it's looking at [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=234.24s)]
*  the reasons that the brokers gave. So it wants to kick the tires on these explanations and make [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=240.32s)]
*  sure that they're true. When volatility goes up, clearinghouses, which are an organization that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=247.04s)]
*  they sort of collectively share the risk of trades defaulting or not happening in the stock market, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=256.64s)]
*  those clearinghouses said to the brokers, you need to give us more cash to cover the risk. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=263.76s)]
*  Some of these brokers couldn't immediately provide all the cash that the clearinghouse wanted. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=270.96s)]
*  And so the only way to limit that call for cash or margin call was to limit new purchases of GameStop. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=276.88s)]
*  Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed information from brokers such as Robinhood, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=287.28s)]
*  and the brokerage is facing more than 30 civil lawsuits in relation to the trading restrictions. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  I am sure that the SEC and FINRA will be going through their rulebooks to determine if there [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=296.23999999999995s)]
*  were violations of the rules. Of course, broker dealers such as Robinhood are claiming that the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=302.88s)]
*  very reason they had to halt trading was to comply with the SEC rules. So they may have a very good [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=308.79999999999995s)]
*  defense that what they did was within their customer agreements that allows them to stop [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=314.4s)]
*  trading for any reason. Experts say the outcomes of these investigations are not likely to come [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=319.2s)]
*  soon, but the influence of social media communities as a new dimension to trading [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  that will likely receive more scrutiny. There's going to be this initial flurry of activity. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=328.32s)]
*  Congress will hold hearings. They will want to assuage the public by taking some initial [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=334.32s)]
*  testimony and looking like they're doing something. But the hard work of making any change in this [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=341.36s)]
*  area will likely take some time. At least through the lens of GameStop, it seems like [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=346.48s)]
*  social media is becoming a bigger influencer of investment decision. That does change how markets [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  behave, at least occasionally, at least with respect to certain stocks. It's not something [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  that they can completely ignore. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HsgPSVivg&t=368.08000000000004s)]
