# The Future of Cities After Covid-19  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 20, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak)
*  This is the city of the future. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, it's a hypothetical one. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=3.0s)]
*  And this is me, Jaden, in cartoon form. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=6.0s)]
*  I wanted to understand how COVID-19 is reshaping the city around me. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=9.0s)]
*  Because right now, my office is sitting mostly empty, shops are closing or struggling to survive, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=14.0s)]
*  and any plans I had for live events are put on hold. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=20.0s)]
*  So I did some research to try to understand which changes will outlast the pandemic. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=24.0s)]
*  Experts paint a picture of a new daily routine that looks more like this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=30.0s)]
*  I split my working hours between my apartment and office, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=34.0s)]
*  where I have to reserve a desk from my phone ahead of time. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=38.0s)]
*  I pick my groceries up from a local corner shop on my way home [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=41.0s)]
*  and order my dinner off a digital menu from a nearby restaurant. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=45.0s)]
*  As the cities around us undergo a transformation, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=49.0s)]
*  the future is being refocused on health, tech and open spaces. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=52.0s)]
*  But will that be enough for cities to thrive again? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=57.0s)]
*  To understand just how big of a turning point this pandemic is for our cities, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=61.0s)]
*  we need to look to health crises of the past. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=66.0s)]
*  More people live in cities than ever before, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=68.0s)]
*  with nearly 70% of the world expected to live in an urban area by 2050. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=71.0s)]
*  But what makes cities so successful as cultural and financial hubs [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=76.0s)]
*  also makes them a hotbed for spreading diseases. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=80.0s)]
*  And the way cities have responded to the spread of diseases throughout history [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=83.0s)]
*  have had lasting impacts. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=87.0s)]
*  Just take this medieval city that was built to quarantine traders and travelers [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=89.0s)]
*  as the bubonic plague spread across 14th century Europe. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=93.0s)]
*  Or how New York City's overheating problem today [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=97.0s)]
*  has been attributed to the Spanish flu epidemic, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=100.0s)]
*  when radiators were made hot enough so people could keep their windows open in the winter to get fresh air. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=103.0s)]
*  You go back another century, the 19th century, with London, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=108.0s)]
*  it helped to improve sanitation conditions. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=112.0s)]
*  And I think that large shocks always cause certain things to change. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=114.0s)]
*  That's Nayan Parikh. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=119.0s)]
*  She's a principal at Jensler Architecture firm in Singapore. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=120.0s)]
*  And she thinks a lot about how design can reshape cities. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=123.0s)]
*  COVID-19 began its spread in an industrial city in China. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=127.0s)]
*  From there, the pandemic has moved from city to city and across entire countries. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=131.0s)]
*  So Nayan says that after the pandemic, we'll have to make some big adjustments. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=137.0s)]
*  Let's start here with how we work. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=142.0s)]
*  I typically used to work in an office. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=144.0s)]
*  And governments are recommending others like me stagger their shift times if they can. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=147.0s)]
*  We're probably going to see a mindset shift in terms of the way people are thinking about the workday, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=152.0s)]
*  especially because of the commute density during those peak times. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=157.0s)]
*  Future Me works 11am to 7pm, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=162.0s)]
*  while others on my team spread their shifts out starting as early as 6am. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=165.0s)]
*  The idea is that staggered shifts can reduce crowding on public transit [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=169.0s)]
*  and in the office as companies try to resume working there. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=173.0s)]
*  Morgan Stanley, for example, is aiming to get about half of its employees back in the office by 2021. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=177.0s)]
*  But like many other companies, their work might not be limited to the office anymore. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=183.0s)]
*  One survey found that 60% of corporate real estate professionals [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=188.0s)]
*  expect remote work to remain an option after the pandemic. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=192.0s)]
*  So I might do my first couple hours of work from home or walk to a nearby coffee shop. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=196.0s)]
*  Around 1pm, before heading into the office, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=201.0s)]
*  I'll have to check a dedicated workplace app to make sure there's space for my colleagues and I to meet. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=204.0s)]
*  I think we're going to start seeing a huge acceleration, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=209.0s)]
*  almost using your phone, if you like, as a digital concierge as you access the space. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=212.0s)]
*  We might see more integrated booking systems, so the way you book, say, your meeting room, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=218.0s)]
*  you might have to book a desk in the future. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=223.0s)]
*  Once I'm in the office, there are fewer cubicles, more meeting spaces, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=225.0s)]
*  open windows, and touchless technology that gets rid of having to touch things like elevator buttons or soap dispensers. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=230.0s)]
*  Of course, not everyone who lives in a city works in a big office, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=237.0s)]
*  and not every business can afford to invest in these smart technologies. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=241.0s)]
*  I think that the conversation around kind of smart cities, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=245.0s)]
*  the conversation around more data to track health and wellness, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=249.0s)]
*  all of these come from a really good place, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=254.0s)]
*  but could start creating really, really dangerous divides that exacerbates the haves and the have-nots. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=256.0s)]
*  There's a whole range of occupations, from health care workers to teachers or servers, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=263.0s)]
*  that can't really be done from a café or modern office buildings. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=268.0s)]
*  Many of the jobs that can't be done remotely are in the service industry, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=272.0s)]
*  where many jobs have also been lost overnight. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=276.0s)]
*  Take retailers, for example. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=279.0s)]
*  You're seeing that if you don't invest as a personal shopper in kind of what's immediately around you, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=281.0s)]
*  it's not going to be immediately around you, which means your neighborhood is totally going to change. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=286.0s)]
*  One research firm estimates that as many as 25,000 U.S. stores could permanently close in 2020. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=291.0s)]
*  The pandemic has made online shopping not just more convenient, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=297.0s)]
*  but necessary as people try to reduce going out, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=300.0s)]
*  and brick-and-mortar retailers need to make big changes to survive. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=304.0s)]
*  The future might look like me adding clothes to an online shopping cart to pick up and try on in a physical store, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=308.0s)]
*  or experiential stores that use brick-and-mortar as more of a branding opportunity, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=314.0s)]
*  like House of Vans or Taobao. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=319.0s)]
*  We did a Taobao store in China pre-COVID. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=322.0s)]
*  It was a completely online store, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=324.0s)]
*  and they started creating physical presence just to build that sense of kind of brand connection. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=327.0s)]
*  So I feel more and more stores will be more about brand connection rather than full-on stores. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=332.0s)]
*  And then there's the 15-minute city, a concept that's being discussed around the world. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=337.0s)]
*  The idea is that everything I need, like groceries, parks, and schools, are all within a short walk of my home. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=342.0s)]
*  And cities are already transforming their streets to help people avoid public transit [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=349.0s)]
*  by widening sidewalks and adding bike lanes. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=354.0s)]
*  So after I finish up Workaround 7, I might walk down to a local boutique and browse handmade products, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=357.0s)]
*  or stop at a street market to pick up locally grown produce. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=363.0s)]
*  Many experts agree that the city center will still be the place to go for shopping and for a night out. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=367.0s)]
*  More businesses like Dine-in Cinemas are merging retail with entertainment. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=373.0s)]
*  And arts and culture is big business in many cities. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=378.0s)]
*  In New York City, performing arts brought in nearly $2 billion in the 2018-19 season. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=381.0s)]
*  I think entertainment really needs footfall. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=387.0s)]
*  And so there's a kind of economic argument for the city still being the cultural center. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=391.0s)]
*  When you're kind of buying into entertainment, you also want to see other people that are kind of part of that experience with you. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=397.0s)]
*  Those shared experiences will probably utilize more outdoor space with the help of technology, like when I go out to eat. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=404.0s)]
*  Smart data that can help with maybe extending restaurant areas into streets after rush hours because it's reading traffic. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=411.0s)]
*  Those kind of things I think can really come to fruition. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=419.0s)]
*  And when I meet up with some friends to go to a big outdoor concert, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=422.0s)]
*  we might use our phones to guide us through a touch-free check-in process and navigate the least crowded routes through the venue. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=426.0s)]
*  For example, today if you go into any building in Beijing or Shanghai, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=434.0s)]
*  you have air quality monitors because there's an expectation that the building will have healthy air because outside the air is not so healthy. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=438.0s)]
*  That expectation has created the need for those monitors. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=447.0s)]
*  And I think in the same way, there will be certain expectations that people want to see what's going on in terms of hygiene and buildings in the future. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=450.0s)]
*  So, will these changes be enough to still make people want to live in cities in the future? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=458.0s)]
*  During lockdowns, more spacious suburbs or the countryside have started to look more attractive for some people. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=463.0s)]
*  But cities have proven resilient in the past. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=469.0s)]
*  I feel like that's kind of a dream that a lot of urban residents have, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=472.0s)]
*  which when actually realized isn't as fulfilling as the kind of diversity and craziness you get of bumping into people in a dense city. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=478.0s)]
*  Life in cities probably won't return to exactly how it was before the pandemic. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=486.0s)]
*  My journey in this city shows a future that could be a lot more digitally integrated, cleaner, and less crowded than before. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2jAuSl1Ak&t=491.0s)]
