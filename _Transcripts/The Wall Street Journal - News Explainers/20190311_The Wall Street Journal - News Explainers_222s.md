# Why It's Almost Impossible to Extract Huawei From Telecom Networks | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 11, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E)
*  The U.S. has been encouraging allies to restrict Huawei from their telecommunications networks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=0.0s)]
*  Security officials say that Beijing could force the Chinese company to spy or even disable [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=6.92s)]
*  countries' networks. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=11.96s)]
*  So far, Australia and New Zealand have moved to block Huawei in their 5G rollout. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=13.6s)]
*  But some European countries have hesitated, saying that Huawei equipment is much cheaper. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=18.32s)]
*  Plus, there's no public evidence that Huawei has or could use its equipment to eavesdrop. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  But even if allied countries bend to U.S. pressure, it may be nearly impossible to extract [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=28.76s)]
*  Huawei from a country's network where it's already in grant. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=37.32s)]
*  Countries are rushing to test and roll out 5G networks, seeing that the potential payoffs [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  are immense. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=45.2s)]
*  The first phase for many carriers will be to upgrade existing 4G networks. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  That means attaching 5G components to legacy infrastructure. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=51.3s)]
*  But guess where much of that legacy hardware comes from? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=55.72s)]
*  Huawei. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=58.8s)]
*  For the first three quarters of 2018, the Chinese company had a 28% share of the global [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=59.8s)]
*  telecom equipment market. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=65.4s)]
*  Nokia and Ericsson are falling behind. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=67.32s)]
*  Take a close look at Huawei's presence in each region. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=70.4s)]
*  Outside of North America, the tech juggernaut outpaces its Nordic rivals. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=73.56s)]
*  So to take Huawei out of the network, whether it's 4G or 5G, countries first have to replace [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=78.8s)]
*  existing infrastructure provided by the company. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=84.92s)]
*  And that's a big chunk of time and money. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  Carriers have opposed banning Huawei, pointing to its superior hardware and lower prices. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  Take a small U.S. rural carrier as an example. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=99.64s)]
*  James Valley Telecommunications says all of its wireless core network and radios are from [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=102.84s)]
*  Huawei. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=108.64s)]
*  It says it will cost around $5,000 per subscriber if it has to replace the entire network. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=109.64s)]
*  Given that it's currently servicing about 10,000 rural customers, the network replacement [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=115.68s)]
*  cost will total $50 million. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=120.68s)]
*  And it goes beyond just the money. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=123.36s)]
*  Talaga Research, a wireless technology research firm, says a typical network replacement cycle [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=125.2s)]
*  takes 5 to 10 years to complete. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=130.48s)]
*  So even if the U.S. were to ban Huawei in 5G, carriers can still expect that Huawei [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  won't be out of the network immediately. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=138.60000000000002s)]
*  Outside of Huawei, Nokia and Ericsson aren't gaining much favor among European carriers. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=143.96s)]
*  Wireless providers say that they've been slow to release equipment as advanced as Huawei's. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=149.84s)]
*  Some of Huawei's 5G technology can be up to a year ahead of its Western rivals, according [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=155.0s)]
*  to some senior executives. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=159.8s)]
*  Huawei's clout in 5G stems from its massive research and development budget. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=161.56s)]
*  In 2017, Huawei spent $13 billion on R&D, more than its chief rivals combined. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=166.96s)]
*  The company now owns the most number of standard essential 5G patents in the world. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=173.72s)]
*  Some of those are now fundamental building blocks to 5G. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=179.32s)]
*  They include one highly prized technique called polar coding, a method for correcting errors [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=182.96s)]
*  in data transmission. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=188.68s)]
*  Regardless of whether a country chooses to block Huawei, there's no way to avoid paying [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=190.44s)]
*  royal fees to license its 5G technology. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=195.08s)]
*  With Huawei at the center of the 5G race, governments and carriers aren't ready to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=198.68s)]
*  abandon it yet. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=203.4s)]
*  Unlike in the U.S., officials in Germany and the U.K. still believe they can allow some [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  Huawei equipment in their countries. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=210.36s)]
*  If more countries follow the U.S.'s advice, knocking out Huawei won't be easy. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUUspncf4E&t=212.72000000000003s)]
