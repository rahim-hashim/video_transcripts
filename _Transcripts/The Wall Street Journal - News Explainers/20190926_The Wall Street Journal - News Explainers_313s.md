# Ukraine Call Rough Transcript How Trumpâ€™s Conversation Unfolded  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 26, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4)
*  Caution. A memorandum of a telephone conversation is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=0.0s)]
*  The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room duty officers [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=20.32s)]
*  and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=25.08s)]
*  As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=85.08s)]
*  named Robert Mueller. An incompetent performance. But they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=113.64s)]
*  Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=119.24s)]
*  Yes, it is very important for me and everything that you just mentioned earlier. For me as [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=122.92s)]
*  a president, it is very important and we are open for any future cooperation. We are ready [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=127.2s)]
*  to open a new page on cooperation and relations between the United States and Ukraine. For [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=131.88s)]
*  that purpose, I just recalled our ambassador from United States and he will be replaced [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=136.8s)]
*  by a very competent and very experienced ambassador who will work hard on making sure that our [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  two nations are getting closer. I would also like and hope to see him having your trust [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=145.64s)]
*  and your confidence and have personal relations with you so we can cooperate even more so. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=149.88s)]
*  I will personally tell you that one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=160.27999999999997s)]
*  meet once he comes to Ukraine. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  Good, because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=169.12s)]
*  that's really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=174.36s)]
*  very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved. Mr. Giuliani is [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=178.32s)]
*  a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=183.44s)]
*  like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the attorney general. Rudy [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=188.12s)]
*  very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=192.52s)]
*  him that would be great. The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=196.92s)]
*  news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news. So I just want [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  to let you know that. The other thing, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=210.88s)]
*  can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  stopped the prosecution. So if you can look into it, it sounds horrible to me. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=220.32s)]
*  I wanted to tell you about the prosecutor. First of all, I understand and I'm knowledgeable [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=225.16s)]
*  about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority in our parliament, the next [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=229.56s)]
*  prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate, who will be approved by the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=234.18s)]
*  parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September. He or she will look into the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=242.96s)]
*  the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=247.28s)]
*  So we will take care of that and we'll work on the investigation of the case. On top of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=252.0s)]
*  that, I would kindly ask you if you have any additional information that you can provide [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=256.28s)]
*  to us, it would be very helpful for the investigation to make sure that we administer justice in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=260.04s)]
*  our country. With regard to the ambassador to the United States from Ukraine, as far [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=264.72s)]
*  as I recall, her name was Ivanovich. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=269.2s)]
*  I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I'm also going to have Attorney General Barr [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=273.6s)]
*  call and we will get to the bottom of it. I'm sure you will figure it out. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=277.64s)]
*  I would like to tell you that I also have quite a few Ukrainian friends that live in [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=283.0s)]
*  the United States. Actually, last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=286.72s)]
*  near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower. I will talk to them and I hope to see [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=291.64s)]
*  them again in the future. I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=295.72s)]
*  United States, specifically Washington, D.C. On the other hand, I also want to ensure you [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=299.68s)]
*  that we will be very serious about the case and we'll work on the investigation. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBXnmMf9IU4&t=304.56s)]
