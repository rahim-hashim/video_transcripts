# Why Blood From Coronavirus Survivors Could Be a Lifeline for the Sick  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 13, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M)
*  With a vaccine against the new coronavirus many months, if not years away, scientists [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=0.0s)]
*  and doctors are racing to treat the disease it causes. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=5.88s)]
*  They have identified antibody testing and blood plasma therapeutics as promising approaches [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=9.28s)]
*  to mitigating the health and economic-related fallout from the pandemic. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  These technologies could also help us learn more about how widely the virus has spread. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=18.3s)]
*  It's based on the same principle of if you have a protective antibody, passive transfer [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  of that could provide not only protection prophylactically but also treatment. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=28.32s)]
*  When patients recover from a viral infection, they produce virus-fighting proteins known [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  as antibodies. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=38.24s)]
*  These circulate in a person's blood and help protect against future infections. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  Antibodies are particular to the invader they're produced to fight off. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=45.44s)]
*  If they're found in the blood, that means the person was infected and that they now [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=48.16s)]
*  have the molecular defenses to fight that virus off, a process known as immunity. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=52.800000000000004s)]
*  In theory, doctors could transfer these antibodies to a person who is still sick so these proteins [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  could help them recover. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  This kind of therapy has been tried in the past during previous public health crises. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=64.48s)]
*  It was used in the 1918 flu epidemic. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=69.54s)]
*  It was used in many outbreaks of mumps, polio, and measles in the early 20th century. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=72.72s)]
*  It continues to be used as recently as the SARS epidemic of 2003. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=80.04s)]
*  The treatment, known as convalescent plasma therapy, is gaining traction now because there [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  aren't other approved alternatives for treating COVID-19. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=90.4s)]
*  The word stopgap is often associated with it and the reason is it is available today. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=93.94000000000001s)]
*  The safety and efficacy haven't been established yet through clinical trials, which is the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  gold standard. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=104.7s)]
*  Preliminary tests in China have shown encouraging results and in March, the FDA started to allow [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=106.44s)]
*  doctors in the US to treat some patients with the plasma of those who have recovered from [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=111.52s)]
*  COVID-19. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=116.28s)]
*  For the recipients, we are looking for people who are admitted to a hospital who are showing [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=117.28s)]
*  increasing oxygen requirements, which indicate to us that they're on a potentially a downhill [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=123.72s)]
*  course. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=129.12s)]
*  Mount Sinai in New York is one of a growing number of hospitals across the country administering [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=130.12s)]
*  convalescent plasma to qualifying COVID-19 patients. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=134.88s)]
*  Recovered patients interested in donating plasma fill out a survey. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=139.0s)]
*  Then to comply with FDA guidelines, clinicians have to put these potential donors through [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=142.96s)]
*  two tests. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=147.28s)]
*  First, a diagnostic test. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=148.28s)]
*  They have to make sure they're not still carrying the new coronavirus and then an antibody [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=150.96s)]
*  test to ensure they're making enough antibodies to fight the virus off. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=155.8s)]
*  That second test looks for antibodies in blood plasma. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=160.62s)]
*  Patients at Mount Sinai developed an antibody test by starting with a genetic code for the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=164.68s)]
*  virus. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=168.84s)]
*  That serves as the blueprint for proteins. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=170.08s)]
*  Using these instructions, they mass produce synthetic copies of a protein that the virus [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  has on its surface. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  Then they take special plates with dozens of tiny wells and coat the bottom of each [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=178.32s)]
*  one with the synthetic proteins. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=183.0s)]
*  After that, they put some of the donor plasma into each well. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=185.28s)]
*  If there are antibodies, these recognize the viral protein and bind to it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=189.28s)]
*  The scientists then add an additional antibody, which lights up what it binds to the synthetic [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=194.32s)]
*  viral protein and coronavirus antibody combo. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  Scientists run this test at different concentrations until it stops lighting up. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=204.44s)]
*  The more they have to dilute the sample, the more antibodies the person's plasma has. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=209.04s)]
*  The more antibodies, the better the plasma is for therapy. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  Scientists do this kind of testing in labs all the time, but to do it clinically, they [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=218.0s)]
*  need to notify regulators. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=222.24s)]
*  If a potential donor passes the virus and the antibody tests, then Mount Sinai clinicians [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=225.68s)]
*  ask them to go to the New York Blood Center, where they can give enough plasma to administer [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=231.12s)]
*  to patients. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=235.08s)]
*  Then there are two other hurdles before that plasma can be given to patients, making sure [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=237.08s)]
*  it doesn't have any other viruses like hepatitis or HIV, and the blood types have to match. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  One donation can likely treat two people, according to preliminary estimates. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=248.0s)]
*  So far, Mount Sinai has treated more than 30 patients. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=252.96s)]
*  Administering the therapy requires Sinai from the FDA. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=257.16s)]
*  How will you tell if somebody is getting better because of this treatment? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=260.0s)]
*  Well, in about four or five days, hopefully they'll be recovering more quickly than other [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=264.16s)]
*  people with similar characteristics. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=268.76s)]
*  We have a team of biostatisticians that are starting to model what happens for patients [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=270.64s)]
*  in our experience in the health system, such as the length of hospital stay, the need for [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=276.20000000000005s)]
*  ICU days, the need for ventilator, and of course, mortality and survival are of course [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=280.20000000000005s)]
*  the ultimate. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=285.6s)]
*  The treatment is not without risks. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=286.6s)]
*  Transfusion reactions can include fever, allergic reactions, and even lung injury. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=289.8s)]
*  And like the swab tests that tell somebody they have the virus, antibody tests are also [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=294.36s)]
*  in short supply. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=299.32000000000005s)]
*  In the long term, the hope is that they could help mitigate some of the economic effects [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  of the pandemic. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=304.56s)]
*  So right now I'm talking to you from my apartment. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=305.92s)]
*  You're in your house in Baltimore, I imagine. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=308.2s)]
*  Could this kind of testing also help policymakers figure out who is able to go back to work [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  safely? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=316.48s)]
*  If we knew who has antibody and they have recovered, you could imagine that those could [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=317.48s)]
*  go work safely. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  It would require an enormous undertaking to test almost everyone in the country. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=325.36s)]
*  The antibody tests also have to be highly accurate. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=330.5s)]
*  And recently, the accuracy of some tests developed abroad has been called into question. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=333.68s)]
*  Despite the challenges, scientists are optimistic that plasma therapy could help patients recover [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=338.52s)]
*  faster and give them clues about how deadly the virus really is. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=343.6s)]
*  We don't know the denominator. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=348.2s)]
*  We don't know the number of people that have been infected but did not have disease. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=350.72s)]
*  And the presence of antibody in their blood will identify that subset. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=357.44s)]
*  And you need to know that number to know really how lethal this disease is. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-pMeVx_6M&t=362.44s)]
