Video Description: NASA’s Artemis I launch has been delayed twice because of problems with their main fuel: liquid hydrogen. It’s not a new one for the space agency. As NASA described it, “hydrogen is difficult to work with.”

Meanwhile, SpaceX has switched to methane for their Mars-bound Starship spacecraft. 

WSJ explains why NASA still uses the leak-prone fuel.

# Why NASA’s Artemis Has Fuel-Leak Problems That SpaceX Doesn’t  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A)
*  It was finally time for NASA to launch Artemis 1, the first step in going back to the moon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=0.0s)]
*  But then NASA called... [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=6.0s)]
*  A scrub for today. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=7.5s)]
*  ...partly because of a problem while fueling the rocket with liquid hydrogen. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=9.5s)]
*  There was a leak at that valve. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=13.0s)]
*  So a few days later, they tried again, and NASA called... [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=16.5s)]
*  A scrub for the launch attempt today. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=20.5s)]
*  ...again because of problems with liquid hydrogen. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=24.0s)]
*  It was a much larger leak. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=27.0s)]
*  Hydrogen is difficult to work with. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=28.5s)]
*  It's why SpaceX and Blue Origin are designing rockets that won't use it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=31.0s)]
*  Our next generation rockets will be using methane as a fuel. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=35.0s)]
*  Here's why NASA is using liquid hydrogen even while SpaceX is moving away from it, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=41.5s)]
*  and why it's causing delays to the Artemis launch. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=46.0s)]
*  Liquid hydrogen packs the most power of any fuel when it comes to the energy it holds, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=50.0s)]
*  nearly three times that of gasoline, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=55.0s)]
*  when it's mixed with liquid oxygen. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=57.5s)]
*  Hydrogen, although it's difficult to work with, it is the best propellant [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=62.0s)]
*  for giving you the maximum change in momentum of your rocket [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=66.5s)]
*  for a finite amount of rocket fuel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=72.0s)]
*  Dr. Philip Metzger spent nearly 30 years at NASA and worked on the Space Shuttle launch team. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=75.0s)]
*  We had trouble in the Space Shuttle program with hydrogen leaks. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=80.0s)]
*  Like in 1990, a Columbia mission was scrubbed three times because of hydrogen leaks. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=83.5s)]
*  Even the very last mission of Space Shuttle Discovery was once [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=88.5s)]
*  officially scrubbed [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=92.0s)]
*  because of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=93.0s)]
*  a hydrogen gas leak. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=94.0s)]
*  The molecules are so tiny, they're made of two hydrogen atoms, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=95.5s)]
*  and the hydrogen atom is literally the smallest atom in the whole cosmos. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=100.5s)]
*  Most of the trouble lies in keeping it in liquid form, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=105.5s)]
*  which happens when it's very, very cold. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=108.5s)]
*  Negative 423 degrees. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=111.5s)]
*  The challenge lies in fueling the hydrogen tank, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=114.5s)]
*  which is inside this orange part called the core stage. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=117.5s)]
*  This tank has to be incredibly well insulated and specially sealed [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=120.5s)]
*  to deal with those tiny molecules and the extreme cold. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=125.0s)]
*  But using liquid hydrogen also causes problems with other connected parts. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=128.0s)]
*  Because the temperature is so low, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=133.0s)]
*  every time you try to flow the hydrogen from the tank into the engine [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=135.5s)]
*  through pipes and valves, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=140.0s)]
*  all the materials are going to shrink because of the cold temperature, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=141.5s)]
*  which causes little tiny cracks to open up. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=146.0s)]
*  So then those tiny atoms, tiny molecules can get through the cracks. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=148.5s)]
*  These complexities are one reason why SpaceX's Starship [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=153.0s)]
*  is being designed to instead use liquid methane. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=156.5s)]
*  Methane doesn't leak as much for a couple of reasons. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=163.5s)]
*  For one thing, it is a much larger molecule. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=166.0s)]
*  In the end, engineering is applied physics, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=169.5s)]
*  and so it always comes back to some basic physics principles [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=172.0s)]
*  like the size of the atom that causes these problems. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=175.0s)]
*  Liquid methane isn't as powerful as liquid hydrogen, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=179.5s)]
*  but it is easier to work with. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=182.0s)]
*  It doesn't have to be kept as cold, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=184.0s)]
*  so the tanks don't need the same extreme insulation. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=186.0s)]
*  There are also fewer problems with the connecting valves and pipes. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=189.0s)]
*  It's a much more benign propellant to deal with as an engineering problem. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=192.5s)]
*  SpaceX also has a good reason to use liquid methane. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=198.5s)]
*  Scientists think it can be made on Mars. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=201.5s)]
*  So the rocket that will eventually go to the Red Planet, their goal, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=204.5s)]
*  is the same that could bring people back to Earth. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=208.0s)]
*  So why is NASA still using tiny, leaky liquid hydrogen? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=211.5s)]
*  One reason, it's part of a system that they've used for decades. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=216.5s)]
*  Another is because of this 2010 Congressional bill [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=221.0s)]
*  that first funded the rocket system, now used for Artemis. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=224.0s)]
*  It says NASA should use the existing workforce and assets, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=227.5s)]
*  which includes existing contracts and propulsion systems, hydrogen. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=231.0s)]
*  The politicians and the policy planners were trying to come up with a program [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=235.5s)]
*  that we could fit in the national budget, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=241.5s)]
*  and they decided let's reuse space shuttle hardware. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=244.5s)]
*  It's a decision that people argue about still. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=248.5s)]
*  The head of NASA, former Senator Bill Nelson, who helped pass the bill, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=251.0s)]
*  defended the decision to continue using liquid hydrogen [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=255.0s)]
*  after the second Artemis scrub. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=258.0s)]
*  We did not have any question about hydrogen. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=260.0s)]
*  We deferred to the experts. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=264.0s)]
*  Even though NASA has repaired hydrogen leaks before, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=266.0s)]
*  Artemis is using nearly all new parts. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=269.0s)]
*  So the scrubs aren't surprising to people like Dr. Metzger. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=272.0s)]
*  This is a growing pain. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=275.0s)]
*  Even if you're using the same components from the space shuttle, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=277.0s)]
*  just the act of putting it together in a new vehicle [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=280.5s)]
*  is going to guarantee that you'll have challenges to work through. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=283.0s)]
*  I mean, it could be something as simple as the way you routed the pipe, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=287.0s)]
*  causing a little bit of side loading on the pipe, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=290.0s)]
*  causing it to torque the connector, which causes a leak. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=293.0s)]
*  It could be any small little thing. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=297.0s)]
*  Although we are having more leaks than a system that's based in methane [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=299.0s)]
*  or another repellent, it's not going to be like this forever. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=304.0s)]
*  NASA said these leaks are just part of the process of a new system [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=308.0s)]
*  and are confident that they will be fixed for future Artemis launches. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=312.0s)]
*  But as long as they're using liquid hydrogen, leaks and scrubs are always possible. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4Jx7ta32A&t=316.0s)]
