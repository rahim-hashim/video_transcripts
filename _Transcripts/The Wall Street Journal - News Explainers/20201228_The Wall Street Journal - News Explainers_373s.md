# Why Investors Are Piling Into Bitcoin Despite the Risks | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 28, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0)
*  In a wild year in the markets, the riskiest asset is one of the hottest. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=0.0s)]
*  Bitcoin. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=5.88s)]
*  Bitcoin. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=6.88s)]
*  Bitcoin is no value. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=7.88s)]
*  It's a bubble. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=8.88s)]
*  Bitcoin may well be a substitute for gold. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=9.88s)]
*  You can see it on this chart. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=11.96s)]
*  After a historic climb and crash three years ago, Bitcoin is at it again. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=14.0s)]
*  Like last time, a surge of investor enthusiasm is driving it to all-time highs. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=19.16s)]
*  And Bitcoin bulls say this is only the beginning. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=24.64s)]
*  They see Bitcoin as a revolution in financial systems. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=27.64s)]
*  They have been pushing this for about 11 years. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=30.8s)]
*  They are finally getting people to listen to them. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=33.92s)]
*  But many bears watching Bitcoin warn that the asset is too volatile for average investors [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=37.28s)]
*  and that it's a purely speculative bet that won't be able to scale. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=42.28s)]
*  We'll explain. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=46.72s)]
*  The way Bitcoin works is key to understanding why it's so popular. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=49.68s)]
*  Unlike other investments, the cryptocurrency isn't tied to physical assets or the US dollar. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=53.92s)]
*  The purpose of Bitcoin is just to allow two people anywhere to exchange value directly. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=59.68s)]
*  What that means is that there is no one central party controlling this network. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  There is no government, there is no central bank that could shut this down or arbitrarily [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=70.68s)]
*  raise or lower the value. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=75.44s)]
*  At its core, Bitcoin is purely software. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=77.08s)]
*  It runs on a network of interlinked but independent computers. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=80.08s)]
*  They form a ledger of transactions between people across the world. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=83.72s)]
*  Instead of that ledger being controlled by a single master computer or a single party, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=88.12s)]
*  the information is copied on every computer that is part of the network. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=92.92s)]
*  This is a cryptocurrency blockchain. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=96.84s)]
*  It can be reviewed by anybody, it can be seen by anybody. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=98.84s)]
*  What that does is it prevents counterfeiting, it prevents double spending. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=102.32s)]
*  It makes Bitcoin a secure currency. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=106.8s)]
*  Every time someone makes a transaction, a unique encrypted signature is added to the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=110.08s)]
*  ledger for verification. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=114.72s)]
*  Once a transaction is confirmed and completed, that signature cannot be changed, it cannot [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=116.6s)]
*  be altered. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=120.96s)]
*  Essentially it means you can't counterfeit a Bitcoin. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=121.96s)]
*  That's what keeps the network honest. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=124.36s)]
*  Many Bitcoin bulls argue that the network is unhackable, but that's not necessarily [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=126.52s)]
*  true. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=131.56s)]
*  The issue is that to hack it, you would have to take over the network, and to take over [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=132.56s)]
*  the network, you would need your own network of computers running 24-7. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=136.52s)]
*  And to do that would cost billions of dollars. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=142.16s)]
*  You can do it, but is it worth it? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=145.8s)]
*  No. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=148.56s)]
*  And while anyone can download and run the program to become part of the blockchain network, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=149.56s)]
*  no one has the ability to make universal changes. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=154.28s)]
*  Bitcoins not yet available to the public are created through a process known as mining. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=157.52s)]
*  Miners use powerful computers to solve complex math problems to process Bitcoin transactions. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=162.96s)]
*  This process unlocks new digital coins. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=168.28s)]
*  But these coins aren't limitless. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=171.16s)]
*  Bitcoin's founding code was embedded with the condition that there would always be a [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=173.56s)]
*  finite number of coins available. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=177.4s)]
*  This scarcity is what gives Bitcoin value. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=180.16s)]
*  Right now, about 18.5 million of the 21 million maximum Bitcoins have already been mined. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=183.4s)]
*  But the way the network is set up, every four years, the reward per batch of transactions [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=190.16s)]
*  confirmed per mining puzzle solved gets cut in half. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=196.14s)]
*  So the 21st millionth Bitcoin will not be created until basically sometime around the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=200.92s)]
*  year 2140. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=208.48s)]
*  And while the number of available Bitcoins is growing, the demand for them is growing [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=210.04s)]
*  faster. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=214.4s)]
*  This demand has a lot to do with how individual investors are trading. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  Bitcoin is becoming easier to buy on apps like PayPal, Square, and Robinhood, which [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  is drawing more novice retail investors who are looking for quick returns while trading [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  at home. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=229.32s)]
*  So far this year, there have been more than 38 million small Bitcoin transfers, trades [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=230.36s)]
*  that are less than $1,000. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  This is up from about 20 million in 2017. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=238.0s)]
*  Larger institutional investors are piling in as well. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  What's really going to be interesting over the next couple of years to watch is the degree [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=245.08s)]
*  to which central banks start to digitize their own currencies. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=249.4s)]
*  As financial systems become more digital, it's leading to Bitcoin becoming more mainstream. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=254.04s)]
*  But the digital currency's resurgence is also closely tied to the state of global finance. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  When the coronavirus pandemic hit, when you had the central banks respond the way they [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=264.32s)]
*  did, what they did was push down interest rates, lowered the value of their currencies. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=268.44s)]
*  That's made Bitcoin essentially a hedge against the dollar. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  The value of the dollar is going down. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=278.32s)]
*  Bitcoin proponents say the value of Bitcoin should be going up. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=279.96s)]
*  What we've seen in the last couple of months is that people are interested in assets that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=283.56s)]
*  have high returns. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=287.28s)]
*  They are willing to take risks. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=288.28s)]
*  And one of the highest returned, highest risk assets anywhere in the capital markets is [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=290.44s)]
*  Bitcoin. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=295.8s)]
*  This potential for big profits is driving a frenzy of momentum trading. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=296.8s)]
*  And for many investors, these bets are paying off. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=301.36s)]
*  The digital currency is up about 220 percent this year. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=303.84s)]
*  One reason investing in Bitcoin is so risky is how small the market is. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=309.09999999999997s)]
*  The total value of Bitcoin in circulation right now is around 420 billion dollars. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=313.38s)]
*  The value of Apple stock, just Apple, is about two trillion dollars. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=319.71999999999997s)]
*  The value of the financial market for gold is north of 12 trillion dollars. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  So Bitcoin is still very small. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=329.88s)]
*  It doesn't take a lot of people to come in and push the value up. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=332.48s)]
*  The smallness of the market contributes to these sort of explosive price moves that we've [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=336.6s)]
*  seen. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=341.92s)]
*  And because the cryptocurrency is decentralized, there is no insurance backing it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=342.92s)]
*  There are no backstops to it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=347.42s)]
*  It could go down to zero tomorrow and there would be nothing to stop it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=349.72s)]
*  There are no circuit breakers. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=354.58000000000004s)]
*  There are no closing bills in Bitcoin trading. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=355.92s)]
*  Until the market matures, experts warn that the price of Bitcoin will continue to see [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=358.52s)]
*  volatile swings. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=362.68s)]
*  So is it risky? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=364.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOuvNDMlI0&t=366.64s)]
