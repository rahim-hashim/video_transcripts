# How Public Universities Became So Expensive  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw)
*  Tuition has been growing fast at America's public universities. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=0.0s)]
*  In-state tuition at public four-year schools increased from $3,800 in 1990 to more than $10,000. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=5.12s)]
*  That's approaching three times the cost after adjusting for inflation. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=13.64s)]
*  And as students logged into class from home in the pandemic, few schools offered discounts. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=17.92s)]
*  President Biden wants to make it more affordable to get a degree. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=23.72s)]
*  Public colleges and universities would be tuition free for families earning less than $125,000. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=28.52s)]
*  The president and his allies argue that the federal government should do more to help students. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=34.32s)]
*  But research says that federal programs meant to help students pay for college [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=39.24s)]
*  have actually made higher education more expensive. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=43.48s)]
*  The story begins on the balance sheets of public four-year schools like the University of Oregon. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=50.04s)]
*  In 2020, the university spent more than $975 million on operations. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  That includes wages for professors and administrators and upkeep on facilities. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  A school can pay for some of its spending by drawing on donations that are stored in an endowment. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  But endowments often have spending limitations. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=74.08s)]
*  So the more important revenue streams for public colleges tend to be state funding and student tuition. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=77.16s)]
*  But what happens with the former greatly affects the latter. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  Josh Mitchell covers economics for The Wall Street Journal. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=87.2s)]
*  What's happened over the years is that burden of paying for college has shifted from state taxpayers to the families themselves. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=90.0s)]
*  And so now we're seeing that more and more schools are relying on tuition to get a bulk of their funding. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=99.16s)]
*  During recessions, many states opt to cut funding for universities. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=106.16s)]
*  The lost revenue is made up by raising tuition or admitting more students, especially ones from out of state or overseas. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=110.64s)]
*  This gives public schools like the University of Oregon an incentive to expand their profile [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=118.36s)]
*  to attract not only in-state students, but also non-residents who have to pay higher out-of-state tuition fees. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  So they bolster their academic programs and they add recreational perks like gyms and rock climbing walls. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=130.28s)]
*  You know, if you can make your campus more attractive by investing in these types of things that students like to do [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=136.56s)]
*  and make it a fun environment like a Disney World environment, more students are going to want to go there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=142.72s)]
*  More students are going to want to apply. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  And therefore, the school is going to have the power to raise tuition and students will be willing to pay. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=149.6s)]
*  These amenities are making prices rise, but there are deeper factors at play. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=156.8s)]
*  Concerns about tuition and the high cost of college have been around since 1900. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=161.68s)]
*  And they really started to rise in the 40s and 50s. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=166.4s)]
*  And so Congress comes in and they say, OK, well, we want to help people pay for college. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=169.88s)]
*  We'll do it through student loans. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  The federal government started financing the college system when Lyndon Johnson signed the Higher Education Act of 1965. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=176.72s)]
*  If we reject learning, we render ourselves dead to the past and lost to the future. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=184.4s)]
*  Since then, generations of leaders have approved changes to the act to influence how money flows into the college system. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=193.24s)]
*  When Congress created this program under the Higher Education Act, it gave schools an incentive to raise their prices [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  because think about it, each student now has a voucher to pay for college. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=206.60000000000002s)]
*  So this became a really big way for schools to make money through student loans. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=210.84s)]
*  And so it gave kind of this perverse incentive for schools to raise their costs. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=215.88s)]
*  Instead of competing on price, a lot of schools actually learned they could actually charge more, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=220.44s)]
*  not less, if they could convince their students that they were prestigious. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=226.04s)]
*  For example, say a student from California receives Pell grants and loans from the federal government. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=230.32s)]
*  They're free to spend that money at the school of their choice. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=236.6s)]
*  Some students opt for an in-state education, but others can be lured by an attractive [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=240.24s)]
*  amenity or a key research program, and they can take those dollars out of state. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=246.04s)]
*  This incentivizes schools to spend more on programs and facilities and ultimately charge more for tuition. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  But those increased costs affect every enrolled student, including those who are in-state. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=259.84s)]
*  Dr. Greg Gordon at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond has studied what makes tuition prices rise so rapidly. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=266.56s)]
*  What we found is that the main drivers of college tuition inflation are demand-side factors, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=273.76000000000005s)]
*  that is, things that increase willingness of students to pay for school. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  Dr. Gordon and his colleague studied the factors that increased average college tuition between 1987 and 2010. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=284.04s)]
*  They found that increases in federal financial aid were responsible for more than 54 percent [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  of all tuition price rises observed in that period. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  In particular, a tweak to federal policies, first seen in 1993, greatly contributed to this increase. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=300.44s)]
*  Before 1993, only subsidized loans existed, so those were given out to students with demonstrated need. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=308.68s)]
*  But in 1993, the program was expanded, so now students who didn't qualify for subsidized loans [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=316.56s)]
*  now qualified for unsubsidized loans. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=322.8s)]
*  This greatly increased the ability of students to pay for school and ultimately led to tuition increases. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=325.28s)]
*  But the federal government isn't the only factor at play here. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  More parents are willing to spend on their children's education because college graduates [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=336.0s)]
*  earn 84 percent more than high school graduates over their careers. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=340.52s)]
*  This earnings premium has risen over time, and it's making tuition prices rise, too. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  So, what can be done to rein in costs for students? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=349.84s)]
*  Leaders in the private and public sectors have offered different paths forward, most notably President Biden. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  Experts tell the Journal that Biden's tuition-free proposal as written would have mixed effects on tuition price increases. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=362.84s)]
*  His call to double the amount given as a grant will give students more money to spend at any college in the country. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=370.47999999999996s)]
*  This could increase student demand for higher education, which would push prices up further. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=376.76s)]
*  But the plan also calls for the federal government to cover 75 percent of in-state tuition for qualifying students [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=381.88s)]
*  if states agree to pay the rest. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=388.48s)]
*  This could calm some of the competition between public colleges for out-of-state students. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=390.64s)]
*  An analysis conducted by Georgetown University professor Anthony Carnavali did find that Biden's proposal would pay for itself. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=395.96s)]
*  We know through a fairly elaborate set of economic analysis of the Biden plan, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=404.52s)]
*  if we put the money down now, 10 years, the program will pay for itself. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=414.24s)]
*  But Dr. Carnavali says the problem of rising tuition can't be addressed with government policy alone. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=418.88s)]
*  The private sector has also proposed ways to train workers without a four-year degree. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=426.2s)]
*  Google, for example, offers a six-month certificate that can stand in for a four-year degree in certain IT roles. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=431.40000000000003s)]
*  And thousands of universities are collaborating with websites like Coursera to provide new and expensive learning options. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=438.52000000000004s)]
*  Experts say that a consensus has emerged. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=446.24s)]
*  Costs for college are too high. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=448.84000000000003s)]
*  And in a world shaken by the coronavirus and an uncertain economic recovery, parents and students are increasingly asking, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=451.24s)]
*  is this all worth it? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtxRa9Xd4vw&t=458.68s)]
