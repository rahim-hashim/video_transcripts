# Why Democrats Are Using Budget Reconciliation to Pass Biden's Agenda  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 19, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o)
*  A debate over how the government manages its budget is taking over Capitol Hill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=0.0s)]
*  The key word is reconciliation. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Reconciliation. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  I'm willing to go to reconciliation. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=8.64s)]
*  Budget reconciliation is a process that speeds up lawmaking. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=10.6s)]
*  That may come in handy for Washington's majority party this summer. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=14.4s)]
*  While a bipartisan group reached an agreement to spend more than $1 trillion on infrastructure [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=18.16s)]
*  in June, this is roads and bridges, but also lots of other kinds of infrastructure. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=23.06s)]
*  Democrats also want to pass the American Families Plan to shore up the country's social safety net. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=28.2s)]
*  Republicans and this group did not want to go along with any of my family plan issues, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  the child care tax credits, the human infrastructure that I talk about. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=38.4s)]
*  In total, the president wants to spend $6 trillion in fiscal year 2022. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  In order to get anywhere close to that level of spending, Democrats will need to use budget reconciliation. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=48.4s)]
*  But there's no guarantee that this will work. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=54.32s)]
*  Divisions within the party could scuttle the entire process. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=56.56s)]
*  Here's how budget reconciliation works and why Democrats are using it to pass Biden's agenda. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=60.24s)]
*  Every fiscal year, Congress has an opportunity to pass a new budget bill. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=66.36s)]
*  This is an opening to pass laws with a simple majority, without needing 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=70.76s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=76.72s)]
*  The purpose of this in many ways, from a partisan perspective, is to get around the 60-vote hurdle on regular legislation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=77.72s)]
*  Bill Hoagland has worked on congressional budgets for more than three decades. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=86.48s)]
*  There had been something like about 22 reconciliation bills enacted into law. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=90.28s)]
*  And I was involved in about 18 of those. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  Here's how the reconciliation process works. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  When a party controls the House, Senate, and White House, it can write the government's budget. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  The first draft of the budget is called a budget resolution. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=109.64s)]
*  This document can include reconciliation instructions for one or more committees to change existing rules on spending, revenue, or debt. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=113.32s)]
*  These instructions allow the controlling party to fold its goals into the budget, instead of passing them as regular laws that are subject to filibusters. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  Once a budget resolution passes, the next step is committee review, where members of Congress write policies that deliver what the reconciliation instructions ask for. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=131.2s)]
*  For example, the Transportation Committee may receive instructions that affect road building programs. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=140.4s)]
*  These instructions can ask the committee to change how much is spent, how much tax is collected, or how much debt the country takes on for this program. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=145.56s)]
*  But new policies sometimes depend on rules and regulations that don't directly affect the budget and might not pass in reconciliation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=154.52s)]
*  It's not out of the realm of possibility that you couldn't create new spending or new taxes or new provisions, but it has to have a direct fiscal impact. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=162.48s)]
*  Once the recommendations are finalized, they're sent to the Senate Budget Committee. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  This group verifies that the revised plan changes the budget in a way that follows the rules of Congress. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  After passing committee review, the budget is sent to the Senate chamber for final consideration on the floor. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=185.88s)]
*  A budget reconciliation bill carries special privileges, which can speed up its passage. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=192.28s)]
*  For starters, there's a 20-hour time limit to review the proposed changes. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=197.96s)]
*  In the normal lawmaking process, debate is what makes Capitol Hill stall out, often in the form of a filibuster. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=202.52s)]
*  A reconciliation bill avoids the filibuster and can pass with a simple majority. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=209.76s)]
*  In the event of a tie, which is possible in today's split Senate, the vice president steps in to cast a tie-breaking vote. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=214.64s)]
*  If the vote passes both chambers of Congress, the reconciliation bill then heads to the president's desk, where it can be signed into law. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=222.28s)]
*  Making rules in this manner comes with caveats. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=231.0s)]
*  For instance, reconciliation measures are supposed to focus on the budget impacts and little else. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=233.96s)]
*  This is one of several restrictions put in place by the Senate's Byrd Rule. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=239.8s)]
*  The biggest one is a provision that says, does the provision in reconciliation, is it merely incidental to an overall policy? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=244.64s)]
*  If it doesn't pass that test, then any United States senator can stand up and say, Mr. President, that provision, XYZ, violates the Byrd Rule. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=254.04s)]
*  I raise a budget act point of order. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  And it is, unless there are 60 votes to waive that point of order, that particular provision is surgically removed. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=265.64s)]
*  If it doesn't kill the bill, it just simply takes it out. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=272.92s)]
*  Early in 2021, the Senate parliamentarian's interpretation of the Byrd Rule forced Democrats to abandon a piece of the COVID-19 bill. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=276.12s)]
*  This reconciliation bill does not include an increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour. In my view, it should have. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=284.52s)]
*  Democrats are on a tight timeline to pass laws that affect many areas, including infrastructure, climate change, taxes, paid sick leave, unemployment payments, child care and education programs. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=292.56s)]
*  It's a lot to get done before the 2022 campaign cycle kicks off. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=304.96s)]
*  When we get into next year, fiscal year 20, budget resolution 23, then it becomes so much more partisan that it may be even more difficult to achieve agreements. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=309.0s)]
*  In order to use budget reconciliation in an evenly split Senate, Democrats need everyone in the party to fall in line. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=321.6s)]
*  That puts all eyes on moderate Democrats like Joe Manchin, who could vote no on a reconciliation bill and prevent any laws from passing. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=329.0s)]
*  If they think in reconciliation, I'm going to throw caution to the wind and go to five or six trillion dollars when we can only afford one or one and a half or maybe two. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=336.04s)]
*  And what we can pay for, then I can't be there. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=346.2s)]
*  With the spending figures piling up and time running out, this year's budget talks are shaping up to be a particularly high stakes negotiation. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USotM0mMZ0o&t=350.16s)]
