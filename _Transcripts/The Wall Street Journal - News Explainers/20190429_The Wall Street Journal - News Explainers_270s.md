# How Fannie and Freddie Prop Up America's Favorite Mortgage | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 29, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U)
*  Owning a home has long been a staple of the American dream. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=0.0s)]
*  And at the center of that are two big companies, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=4.74s)]
*  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Sound familiar? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=8.0s)]
*  Maybe you haven't thought that much about them [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=11.9s)]
*  since the 2008 financial crisis. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=14.08s)]
*  The federal government is stepping into it to stabilize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=16.12s)]
*  The two companies almost collapsed under the weight of an unprecedented housing bust. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  But then the government stepped in to bail them out. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=24.86s)]
*  Now, the Trump administration has asked for plans to reshape Fannie and Freddie. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=27.92s)]
*  But a housing finance overhaul could mean privatizing or shrinking the two companies. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  A process that some believe could mean mortgages will become more expensive [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=37.32s)]
*  and less affordable for millions of Americans. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=41.32s)]
*  That includes the most popular home loan in the U.S. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=49.24s)]
*  Homeowners like this mortgage because of the low monthly payments [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=52.08s)]
*  and the interest rate that doesn't fluctuate. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=55.16s)]
*  We'll explain, but first you have to understand how Fannie and Freddie fit into the U.S. housing system. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  First, homeowners borrow money from banks or other lenders. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=67.47999999999999s)]
*  Then, Fannie and Freddie buy these mortgages and package them into securities. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  Then they sell those securities to investors. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=77.24s)]
*  Investors buy them because they're considered safe. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=80.52s)]
*  Because Fannie and Freddie take on much of the risk. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=83.4s)]
*  Lenders and banks benefit too. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=86.56s)]
*  Since the government takes on much of the default risk, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=88.56s)]
*  lenders can make more loans to more people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=91.56s)]
*  Together, Fannie and Freddie now back about half of new U.S. mortgages. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=94.4s)]
*  So why do some want to change the two companies? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  Some in Washington want to shrink or even get rid of Fannie and Freddie. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  And President Trump himself has indicated that he wants to roll back the government's involvement in the two companies, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=109.56s)]
*  which have been under government control since the financial crisis. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  But a housing finance overhaul could mean privatizing or shrinking the two companies. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=118.64s)]
*  Those looking to shrink Fannie and Freddie argue that the government shouldn't be involved in the housing market to the extent it is now. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  They say that the private sector, not the government, should be filling this role. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=130.35999999999999s)]
*  But those who support Fannie and Freddie say that home ownership is a path to prosperity for the middle class, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=135.12s)]
*  and that the government has a responsibility to keep housing affordable. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=140.44s)]
*  But now some are wondering, what would the U.S. housing market look like without Fannie and Freddie? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=144.76s)]
*  Well, to start with, many non-bank lenders might find it harder to operate. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=152.08s)]
*  Unlike banks, these firms don't have deposits, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=156.88s)]
*  which means it will be more expensive for them to lend money if Fannie and Freddie go away. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=159.56s)]
*  These so-called non-bank lenders make up about half of new U.S. mortgages today, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  and they're often the only path that first-time borrowers or middle-income families have for getting a mortgage. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=169.11999999999998s)]
*  That's because in the last decade, many banks have focused largely on wealthy borrowers when making mortgages, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=175.04s)]
*  and the non-banks have moved in to fill the space they left. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=180.92s)]
*  Beyond that, no one's really sure what the market would look like without Fannie and Freddie. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=185.0s)]
*  But let's consider other countries, which don't operate their housing markets like the U.S. does. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=191.56s)]
*  In many countries, long-term fixed-rate home loans, including the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, aren't largely available. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=197.16s)]
*  Instead, mortgage rates reset depending on the market. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=204.48s)]
*  And even a one-point increase in your mortgage's interest rate can add hundreds of dollars to your monthly payment. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=207.84s)]
*  We can also look at the U.S. before Fannie was created in 1938. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=214.52s)]
*  Back then, borrowers had to come up with much larger down payments, often 50% or more. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  Mortgages also tended to last for just five or ten years, with a big balloon payment that came due at the end. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  So, future mortgages could look like this, or not at all. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=232.84s)]
*  Much of it depends on how the government plans to reshape Fannie and Freddie. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=237.72s)]
*  But reshaping them won't be easy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=241.68s)]
*  People like the benefits they create, including the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  And right now, there isn't much agreement on either side of the aisle on how to get rid of the government's involvement in housing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=248.56s)]
*  At least, not without completely overhauling the way the housing system works. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  So, for now, Fannie and Freddie's future is still up in the air. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1V7H5pJY4U&t=260.04s)]
