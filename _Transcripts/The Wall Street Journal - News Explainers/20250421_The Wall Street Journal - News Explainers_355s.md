Video Description: President Trump’s broad tariff rollout takes aim at the U.S. trade deficit, which he calls a policy of “economic surrender.” As Trump’s global trade war carries on, it raises the question: is a trade deficit necessarily a bad thing for the economy?

WSJ explores how the trade deficit works, why economists say it can be good and how tariffs affect it.

# Trump Tariffs Are Attacking the U.S. Trade Deficit—Does It Need Fixing? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg)
*  President Donald Trump thinks the U.S. trade deficit is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=0.0s)]
*  the policy of unilateral economic surrender [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=3.12s)]
*  and that his latest tariff policy will fix it. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=6.72s)]
*  For decades our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, and plundered by nations near and far, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  both friend and foe alike. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=14.8s)]
*  The U.S. trade deficit is nothing new. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=17.12s)]
*  We've run one every year since the 70s. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=19.36s)]
*  Can it be that bad? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Here's how the trade deficit works, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=23.68s)]
*  why economists say it can be good or bad, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=25.44s)]
*  and how tariffs affect it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=28.16s)]
*  Trade with foreign countries is, well, it's complicated, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=30.96s)]
*  especially how we measure it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=33.76s)]
*  For one, with some countries, like Madagascar, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=35.36s)]
*  we want more of their vanilla beans, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=37.76s)]
*  which we don't really grow, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=39.36s)]
*  than they could ever want in stuff from us. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=40.88s)]
*  So there's an imbalance there. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  There's one with the Netherlands too, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=44.8s)]
*  but just because that's where Europe's largest port is, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=46.4s)]
*  not because the Dutch are using 11 billion in medical equipment each year. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=49.68s)]
*  There's lots of movement in this global economy. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=53.84s)]
*  A single item could have its parts imported and exported a dozen times. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=56.24s)]
*  So economists say it's best not to look at country-by-country bilateral trade, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  but overall total trade when talking about the trade deficit. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=64.8s)]
*  So here's how much we imported last year, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=68.64s)]
*  and here's how much we exported. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=71.68s)]
*  This difference here is our trade deficit. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=74.08s)]
*  And we've been importing more than we've been exporting for a long time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  And these overall numbers include two types of trade, goods and services. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=81.12s)]
*  Services are things like tourism and consulting, people-based trade. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=85.92s)]
*  And we actually have run a surplus for a long time, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=89.92s)]
*  exporting more than we're importing, when it comes to services. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=92.4s)]
*  But when President Trump talks about [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=95.6s)]
*  "...tronic trade deficits." [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=97.2s)]
*  He's talking about the goods deficit, physical things like [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=98.72s)]
*  "...computers, phones, televisions, and electronics." [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=102.48s)]
*  This is where we've really run a deficit for a long time. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=105.68s)]
*  And it's why our overall trade does too. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=109.04s)]
*  Here it is in line form again. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=111.84s)]
*  We've had one even in good economic times. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=114.16s)]
*  Growth is generating wealth, so we're spending more. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=116.96s)]
*  More than can be satisfied solely with domestic things. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=119.92s)]
*  So we import more, adding to the trade deficit. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  If you look at when there's a recession, that's often when the deficit shrinks. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=126.48s)]
*  We're spending less, so we're importing less. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=130.96s)]
*  That's actually a better way to look at this trade deficit, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=133.76s)]
*  is that we spend more than we bring in as revenue. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=136.24s)]
*  For a household, it can be bad. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  But for a country, it's more complicated. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=141.44s)]
*  So let's ask an important economist who has spent decades working on this. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=144.64s)]
*  Now is it good or bad to have a trade deficit? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=148.56s)]
*  It's really neither, and it depends on the circumstances. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=152.48s)]
*  Typical economist answer. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=157.76s)]
*  Okay, here's where things get wonky. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=159.44s)]
*  When we spend more than we bring back in, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=161.44s)]
*  that deficit amount of money is out in the world, in U.S. dollars. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=163.6s)]
*  What do these companies do with those U.S. dollars? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=167.92s)]
*  Well, they often invest it back into the U.S., into U.S. companies or securities, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=170.32s)]
*  which isn't measured as an import. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=175.6s)]
*  Whether that's a good thing or not depends on what is driving the deficit. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=177.68s)]
*  For example, imagine that you have companies that have [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=182.32s)]
*  very lucrative investment opportunities. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  They are going to finance these investments in part by selling equity shares. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=190.64s)]
*  Foreigners will likely end up buying some of those. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=196.24s)]
*  Now, is that a bad thing? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=199.76s)]
*  Not necessarily if the investment pays off. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=202.16s)]
*  Its U.S. shareholders do well. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  The foreign shareholders do well. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  Everyone gains, and the U.S. grows more quickly. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=209.6s)]
*  Many economists point to this investment, fueled by this deficit, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  as one of the things that has made the U.S. so prosperous. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  We're also in a trade deficit in part because we're in a national deficit. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=219.76s)]
*  Each year, Congress spends more than it brings in through tax revenue. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=223.84s)]
*  It takes on debt by selling bonds, bonds often bought by foreigners [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=227.68s)]
*  with those U.S. dollars from our trade deficit. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=231.84s)]
*  The economic debate over whether the trade deficit is good or bad [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=234.88s)]
*  depends largely on whether that money is being invested back into the U.S. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=239.12s)]
*  But the political debate over whether the trade deficit is good or bad [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=244.08s)]
*  depends on how much you think the U.S. should be relying on foreign investments. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=248.08s)]
*  The globalists, the big globalists have been ripping off the United States. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=252.16s)]
*  They've been taking money away from the United States. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=255.84s)]
*  And all we're doing is getting some of it back. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=257.76s)]
*  So will tariffs make the trade deficit go down? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=260.96s)]
*  Again, could be yes or no. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=264.16s)]
*  But probably no. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=266.48s)]
*  If you think that tariffs are going to affect the trade deficit, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  you have to ask how do they affect overall output [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=272.08s)]
*  and how do they affect overall spending? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=275.2s)]
*  And the answer is probably that because they push us into more inefficient production, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=277.36s)]
*  that they're actually negative for output. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=283.04s)]
*  Because they raise prices for consumers and prices for firms, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=285.28s)]
*  probably negative for overall spending. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  Output may go down, spending may go down. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=292.88s)]
*  Notice that all economic activity is going down and that's not good. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  But the effect on the deficit is unclear. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  And I would say that a deficit that falls because you've imposed tariffs [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  is probably a deficit that's not falling for the right reasons. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=310.64s)]
*  The deficit should fall because people want to save more to provide for the future. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=314.96s)]
*  They become more thrifty. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=321.2s)]
*  That's great. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=322.23999999999995s)]
*  Or the government becomes more thrifty, an even more far-fetched idea. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=322.96s)]
*  But all of that is another way of saying that when imports fall, exports tend to fall. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  One extreme case might be if the US actually goes into a recession [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=332.4s)]
*  as a result of these tariffs. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=337.67999999999995s)]
*  In which case, I would expect the deficit to fall [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=340.0s)]
*  because recession is likely led by cutbacks in investment and consumer spending. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CygrmYdJOXg&t=343.92s)]
