# What We Know About How a Russian Nuclear Strike Could Play Out  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE)
*  These are some of the storage units where Russia houses its atomic warheads. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=0.0s)]
*  Satellite images are a key tool for the world to keep an eye on the nuclear sites dotted [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=4.92s)]
*  across the country. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=9.44s)]
*  As Russian President Vladimir Putin suffers losses in Ukraine, he has suggested that he [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=11.68s)]
*  was ready to use his nuclear arsenal. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=15.88s)]
*  We are using all the resources available to us. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=17.76s)]
*  This is not a lie. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=23.28s)]
*  A nuclear strike is still widely seen as an unlikely scenario. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=25.84s)]
*  But Western officials have said they are concerned, and President Biden warned the world could [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=29.8s)]
*  face the prospect of an Armageddon. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  So how would a Russian nuclear strike play out? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=35.84s)]
*  It's not like there is a big red button on the president's desk. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  By looking at a map of Russia, we can learn a lot about how Putin would activate his atomic [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  force. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  These dots represent the known locations where Russia houses some of its nuclear weapons. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Places like these have been identified by analysts who monitor nuclear arsenals using [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=55.6s)]
*  satellite images and other sources. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=59.660000000000004s)]
*  The red ones indicate sites where tactical nuclear warheads are stored. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=62.64s)]
*  Typically, these are lower-yield weapons used on delivery systems with a range under 310 [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=66.52s)]
*  miles. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=71.8s)]
*  And the blue dots represent where some of Moscow's strategic weapons are deployed. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  These have more power and can travel up to about 9,000 miles. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=77.12s)]
*  If Moscow decided to launch a nuclear attack, many Western and Ukrainian officials believe [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=81.54s)]
*  it would turn to tactical weapons. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=85.94000000000001s)]
*  Normally, it is assumed that strategic weapons are the last things you touch. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=88.06s)]
*  Hans Christensen is the director of the Nuclear Information Project and has been studying [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=93.26s)]
*  Russian nuclear weapons for decades. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=97.54s)]
*  The assumption is the tactical nuclear weapons, to the extent that they would escalate to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=99.84s)]
*  nuclear use, would be the first that would be used. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=103.38000000000001s)]
*  Russia has 2,889 warheads in storage. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=107.46000000000001s)]
*  According to American analysts, that's almost a thousand more than the U.S. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=110.9s)]
*  And even those tactical weapons can be very powerful and destructive. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=116.74000000000001s)]
*  The RN-40 gravity bomb, carried in jets such as these, has the same estimated power as [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=120.66000000000001s)]
*  30 kilotons of dynamite. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=126.38000000000001s)]
*  That's more than the bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at about 15 to 20 [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=128.18s)]
*  kilotons. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=134.1s)]
*  And much less than Russia's strategic weapons, these intercontinental ballistic missiles, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=135.1s)]
*  for example, can have a yield of 300 to 800 kilotons. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=139.3s)]
*  A strike using those weapons would be enough to destroy any major city, according to Christensen. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=143.58s)]
*  If Russia was to actually deploy tactical nuclear weapons at these sites, it would first [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=150.36s)]
*  have to tackle some logistical challenges. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=154.74s)]
*  That starts with retrieving the warheads from the storage bunkers or units that they're [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=157.58s)]
*  housed in. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  Those weapons are all in storage facilities. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  Pavel Podvig is a Geneva-based nuclear weapons expert who tracks Russian storage bases. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=166.18s)]
*  These are normally some distance from the delivery systems. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=171.22s)]
*  Take this site in Byelorussia near the border with Ukraine, for example. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=175.86s)]
*  On a nuclear order, the site personnel would have to retrieve the warheads from bunkers. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=179.42000000000002s)]
*  Then they would load them onto trucks in special climate-controlled containers and transport [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=184.38s)]
*  them to an airfield or designated point near a missile base like this one. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=188.82s)]
*  Once they arrive, they would then need to be installed on a launcher or airplane. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=194.5s)]
*  So actually deploying them for combat could take many hours or up to a few days, military [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=198.74s)]
*  analysts say. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=203.58s)]
*  That whole process would be very hard to complete without other countries realizing, as movements [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=205.02s)]
*  are being tracked by intelligence teams, according to defense experts. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  So Russia appears to have taken steps to be less visible. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=213.46s)]
*  If you look at the satellite photos over these nuclear weapons storage sites, they typically [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=216.74s)]
*  have sort of a roof or a garage at the entrance. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=220.44s)]
*  So any truck that drives up goes into this garage. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=226.24s)]
*  So you can't see what they're loading on board. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=229.6s)]
*  But increasing the chances the message of a strike would spread is the multiple personnel [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=232.48s)]
*  involved along the way. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=236.32s)]
*  The group responsible for Russia's nuclear weapons is a special unit called the 12th [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=239.62s)]
*  Chief Directorate. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=243.68s)]
*  Analysts say the individuals in that force could potentially oppose strikes. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=245.16s)]
*  The military would be part of that process. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=249.72s)]
*  They would have a chance at least to offer their opinion on that plan and whether it [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=253.16s)]
*  should go ahead. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=261.76s)]
*  If movement at the facilities was detected, the West could respond in a number of ways, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=263.4s)]
*  according to military analysts. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=267.96s)]
*  One scenario is that countries could target Moscow's storage bases, which carries huge [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=270.4s)]
*  risks, while another is imposing more sanctions. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=274.92s)]
*  Strategic nuclear weapons like this intercontinental ballistic missile are even less likely to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=279.88000000000005s)]
*  be used. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  But hypothetically, they would be much quicker to deploy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  They're standing in their silos, the missiles, or they're on board ballistic missile submarines, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=289.52000000000004s)]
*  and they're loaded with nuclear warheads, ready to fly in a few minutes. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=295.16s)]
*  However, before any of that, Putin would need to actually order a strike. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  And there's a series of steps that need to take place within the Kremlin for that to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=306.20000000000005s)]
*  happen. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=309.44s)]
*  The process is secretive and hard to monitor and could even have changed since the Ukraine [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=310.44s)]
*  War began. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=315.32000000000005s)]
*  Defense analysts have made an educated guess how it would unfold, based on documents and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=317.04s)]
*  sources. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  The theory is that there are three people that need to be involved in an actual launch [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  of Russian nuclear weapons, the Russian president Putin and the minister of defense, and then [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=332.32s)]
*  also the chief of the armed forces. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=337.52s)]
*  They're supposed to have three briefcases, so to speak, electronic communication devices [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=339.44s)]
*  that can use to activate the nuclear option. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=344.78s)]
*  Some defense experts believe that two out of three of those officials would need to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=348.28s)]
*  agree for the strike to be carried out. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=351.79999999999995s)]
*  If that is the, in fact, the setup, then it's very different from the American setup, where [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=353.76s)]
*  the president has the sole authority to launch this and he doesn't require, he doesn't [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=360.28s)]
*  need approval from anyone else. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=365.47999999999996s)]
*  In addition to the chain of command, Russia has a strategic planning document or military [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=367.84s)]
*  doctrine which lays out how nuclear weapons could be used. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=372.2s)]
*  The document says it allows the use of nuclear weapons if they or other types of weapons [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=376.76s)]
*  of mass destruction are used against it, as well as in the event of aggression that threatens [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=381.35999999999996s)]
*  the existence of the Russian Federation. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=386.0s)]
*  The interpretation of that document rests on the shoulders of Putin, who has already [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=388.52s)]
*  said the territorial integrity of Russia may be threatened and has claimed the annexation [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=392.32s)]
*  of four Ukrainian territories. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=397.2s)]
*  When asked if Russia could use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=399.47999999999996s)]
*  told the Wall Street Journal, we consider such inflated nuclear rhetoric unacceptable. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=403.91999999999996s)]
*  But with Moscow facing setbacks in Ukraine, officials and military analysts say the use [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=411.46s)]
*  of tactical weapons can't be completely rolled out. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yCz_UN5CE&t=415.96s)]
