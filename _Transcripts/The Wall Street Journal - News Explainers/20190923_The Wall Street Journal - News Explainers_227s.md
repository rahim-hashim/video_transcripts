# How Negative Yields Work  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 23, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U)
*  This chart shows the yield on the German government's 30-year bonds over the past few months. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=0.0s)]
*  You'll notice something unusual happened in early August. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=6.8s)]
*  The yield dropped below zero. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  A yield is the return investors receive on a bond. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  A negative yield is the opposite, meaning investors are receiving less money than they [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=17.2s)]
*  originally paid. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=21.64s)]
*  Negative yields are a relatively new feature in the world's bond markets, but they're [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  appearing with increasing frequency. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=28.16s)]
*  Globally, around $16 trillion worth of bonds currently carry a negative yield. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=30.48s)]
*  Bonds are one of the safest investments on the market. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=37.04s)]
*  They're staples of many investment portfolios, from pension funds to retirement accounts. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=39.44s)]
*  Investors like them because of their reliable returns. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  So how did some bond yields go negative? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=48.84s)]
*  And why would investors keep putting their money in assets with negative returns? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=51.8s)]
*  To understand negative yields, you need to understand how bonds work. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=56.68s)]
*  Bonds are a form of debt that governments and companies issue for various lengths of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=67.8s)]
*  time. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=71.08s)]
*  A bond's lifespan can range from a few weeks to a few decades. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=72.08s)]
*  Bond issuers make regular interest payments to bond holders over the asset's lifespan. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=77.08s)]
*  This is known as the coupon rate. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=82.36s)]
*  Bonds are often bought and sold on the secondary market. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=85.4s)]
*  Their prices fluctuate, which affects what an investor can expect to earn. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  The yield is a calculation of how much an investor can expect to make from holding onto [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=93.22s)]
*  a bond bought at a particular price for a particular length of time. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=97.56s)]
*  The yield of a bond is inversely related to its price. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=102.42s)]
*  High demand in the bond market drives up prices and drives down yields. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  This is largely why yields are negative. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=110.72s)]
*  Right now, the bond market is experiencing unusually high demand. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=113.64s)]
*  There are a few reasons for this. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=117.88s)]
*  The first is that investors have grown increasingly concerned about the lack of growth in the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=120.56s)]
*  global economy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=124.76s)]
*  Amid low inflation, political uncertainty and trade disputes, investors are putting [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=126.44s)]
*  more money into safer assets, like bonds. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=130.84s)]
*  The second is that several central banks around the world have set their interest rates below [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=134.72s)]
*  zero. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=139.0s)]
*  Central banks are banks for commercial banks, so when they set negative interest rates, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=140.36s)]
*  commercial banks must pay them for the privilege of holding their money. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=144.72000000000003s)]
*  This incentivizes commercial banks to lower the interest rates they charge to. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=148.66000000000003s)]
*  So far, commercial banks have been reluctant to pass that negative rate to average consumers. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=153.0s)]
*  But some have passed on the cost to companies and large institutional investors. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=158.08s)]
*  Negative rates give investors an incentive to buy bonds rather than park their money [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=163.44000000000003s)]
*  at a bank. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  This drives up demand. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=168.04s)]
*  These factors have pushed bond prices higher and driven down yields, so much so that they [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=171.16s)]
*  are now in negative territory and, in some cases, even below the negative rates set by [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=175.64s)]
*  central banks. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  So why would investors continue to buy bonds with negative yields? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, if demand continues to rise, buying now means potentially selling bonds later [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=186.04s)]
*  at a higher price. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=191.28s)]
*  This can help offset losses in the short term. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  The long-term implications of negative yields could mean lower returns on pensions and retirement [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=196.04s)]
*  accounts, meaning workers might have to save more and work longer. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=200.84s)]
*  Negative bond yields and negative interest rates in general are viewed as a short-term [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  remedy to get economies moving. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=209.16s)]
*  But with the footprint of negative rates getting deeper and wider, investors worry that they [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  may be less of a temporary fix and more of a permanent fixture in the market. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyBZWrp9P4U&t=215.32s)]
