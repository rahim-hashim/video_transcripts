# Former Debate Coach Explains Biden’s and Trump’s Debate Strategy | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE)
*  — Senator Biden. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=0.0s)]
*  — Vice President Biden. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=1.12s)]
*  — Vice President Biden. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=2.42s)]
*  — President Joe Biden has been in more debates [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=3.34s)]
*  on the presidential level than just about any other politician, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=5.42s)]
*  nearly 30 of them. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=8.9s)]
*  And he's getting ready to take the stage again, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=10.42s)]
*  this time for a rematch against former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  — What do you want to call him? Give me a name. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=16.5s)]
*  Give me a name. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=17.78s)]
*  — White supremacist and right-wing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=18.14s)]
*  — Who would you like me to condemn? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=19.14s)]
*  — White supremacist and right-wing. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=20.06s)]
*  — Stand back and stand by. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=22.62s)]
*  — Both Biden and Trump are experienced debaters [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=24.7s)]
*  on the presidential level. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=27.66s)]
*  They both had some stumbles in the last few months and weeks [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=29.16s)]
*  and are both looking to this opportunity [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  to reset the narratives a bit on the campaign. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=36.08s)]
*  — Here's how the two presumed presidential nominees [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=39.68s)]
*  have evolved on the debate stage, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=41.92s)]
*  and what's at stake this time. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=43.72s)]
*  — So as we debate these issues, let's put them in concrete terms [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=46.8s)]
*  and understand that when we talk about these statistics, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=51.3s)]
*  we're talking about people. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=54.6s)]
*  — President Biden, one of the things he does well [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=55.88s)]
*  is he projects well as a decent, honest human being, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=58.74s)]
*  and he wants to make sure that people understand [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=63.52s)]
*  that he is an American just like them, out of the working class. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=66.64s)]
*  — Ted Olson, a former U.S. Solicitor General, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=71.12s)]
*  stood in as Biden during Republican vice presidential nominee [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=73.68s)]
*  Paul Ryan's debate prep sessions in 2012. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=77.28s)]
*  — I was looking at every tape I could get my hands on, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=80.56s)]
*  every video of every debate, every policy statement. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=84.28s)]
*  Now, he does go back in politics for decades, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=88.44s)]
*  so there's an awful lot of material there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=91.98s)]
*  — Biden's first presidential forum was nearly 40 years ago, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  alongside his Democratic rivals in Houston. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=99.5s)]
*  He'd already been in public office for more than a decade. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=102.46s)]
*  — And I believe we can meet all these challenges [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=106.46s)]
*  that we've talked about tonight. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=108.42s)]
*  And it's not just my 15 years of experience [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=110.82s)]
*  as a United States senator that tells me that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  It's my unyielding belief that the American people [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=115.5s)]
*  can solve any problem they set their minds to. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=118.14s)]
*  — He does use certain phrases over and over again. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=121.52s)]
*  He has certain quirky mannerisms with respect to his speech. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=124.52s)]
*  — Look, folks. Look, folks. Look, folks. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=128.44s)]
*  — He has this sort of big smile, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=130.64s)]
*  this like large wattage smile that he would really flash [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=132.64s)]
*  as in a disarming way. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=136.32s)]
*  He did this particularly well, I thought, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  during his vice presidential debates. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=140.44s)]
*  So as he's being attacked, he's not scowling, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=142.4s)]
*  he's not nodding his head angrily, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=145.6s)]
*  he's not furiously taking notes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=147.58s)]
*  He's just flashing this giant smile and chuckling a little bit. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=149.78s)]
*  — Senator Biden, you would remember that in that energy plan [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=154.22s)]
*  that Obama voted for, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=157.18s)]
*  that's what gave those oil companies those big tax breaks. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=158.62s)]
*  Your running mate voted for that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=162.5s)]
*  — By 2012, when Biden faced Paul Ryan [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=164.9s)]
*  in the vice presidential debate, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=167.42000000000002s)]
*  the Democratic nominee had served in the Senate [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=169.06s)]
*  for nearly 40 years. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=171.34s)]
*  — Joe Biden wasn't so inhibited because people knew him. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=173.66s)]
*  He knew himself. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=177.34s)]
*  He roved a lot in terms of the subject of the conversation. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=178.72s)]
*  He was sarcastic, he was smirking, he was snarkish. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=182.52s)]
*  — And when we look weak, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=186.44s)]
*  our adversaries are much more willing to test us. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=187.76s)]
*  They're more brazen in their attacks, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=190.12s)]
*  and our allies are less willing to try that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=191.16s)]
*  — With all due respect, that's a bunch of malarkey. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=192.24s)]
*  — His weakness is that he has difficulty staying on the subject. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=194.84s)]
*  He'll answer or direct something [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=198.88s)]
*  to the point of the question that he has asked, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=200.8s)]
*  but then he will drift off into something [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=203.68s)]
*  that's tangential to that, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=205.76s)]
*  and that distracts from the image [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=207.56s)]
*  that he's going to want to project of someone [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  that's mature, sensible, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=212.72s)]
*  and in full control of his faculties. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=214.76s)]
*  — Joe Biden comes with a half a century of experience [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=218.2s)]
*  in national politics, but interestingly enough, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=221.04s)]
*  it is Donald Trump who has had more times [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=223.84s)]
*  on the presidential debate stage than Joe Biden. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=227.72s)]
*  — Trump has participated in at least 15 debates [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  for the presidency since his first White House bid in 2016. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=234.12s)]
*  — It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=238.24s)]
*  of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=241.52s)]
*  — Because you'd be in jail. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=245.44s)]
*  — Secretary Clinton. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=246.72s)]
*  — Former President Trump does not have a natural inclination [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=248.8s)]
*  to be calm or temperate. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=253.52s)]
*  He has a tendency to be aggressive. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=255.32s)]
*  He is very impulsive. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=257.96s)]
*  He will say what comes into his mind. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=260.04s)]
*  — Don't ever use the word smart with me. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=262.28s)]
*  Don't ever use that word. — Oh, give me a break. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=264.35999999999996s)]
*  — Because you know what? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=266.08s)]
*  There's nothing smart about you, Joe. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=267.28s)]
*  47 years, you've done nothing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=268.67999999999995s)]
*  — President Trump, he casts himself frequently as the outsider. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=270.47999999999996s)]
*  Trump is able to get under his opponent's skin [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=274.4s)]
*  when he's on the debate stage and rattle them [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=277.0s)]
*  and make them say things or do things [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=280.35999999999996s)]
*  or appear to be weak in some way, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=282.35999999999996s)]
*  and he's been able to use that to great effect, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=285.88s)]
*  particularly in 2016. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=287.4s)]
*  — Don't worry about it, little Marco. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=289.44s)]
*  I think you saw in the 2020 debates [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=292.16s)]
*  that Biden was prepared for some of Trump's antics. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=295.04s)]
*  — Vote now. — Are you going to pack the court? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=299.08000000000004s)]
*  — Make sure you, in fact, let people know. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  — He doesn't want to answer the question. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=302.88000000000005s)]
*  — I'm not going to answer the question because— [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=304.28000000000003s)]
*  — Why would you answer that question? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=305.32000000000005s)]
*  — Because the question is— [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=306.64000000000004s)]
*  — The question is— [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=307.8s)]
*  — Rattle left. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=309.36s)]
*  — Will you shut up, man? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=310.52000000000004s)]
*  — Listen, who is on your list, Joe? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  Who's on your list? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  — Gentlemen, I think we've ended this. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=314.8s)]
*  — This is so unprecedented. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=316.04s)]
*  — He's going to pack the court. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=317.04s)]
*  — But the first presidential debate in 2024 [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=318.04s)]
*  will look a little different. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  There won't be a live audience, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=322.08s)]
*  and microphones will be muted [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=323.47999999999996s)]
*  when it isn't the candidate's turn to speak. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=325.24s)]
*  — Having these guardrails, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=327.52s)]
*  they might actually end up benefiting Trump, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=329.12s)]
*  who's sort of been known to be a big interrupter, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=331.28s)]
*  because it will prevent him from being seen [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=334.03999999999996s)]
*  as somebody who is just, you know, so overbearing. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=338.68s)]
*  — This is a 90-minute debate, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  which is in a long period of time. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=343.96s)]
*  Both of these individuals are aged. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=345.84s)]
*  I can say this because I am, too. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=348.12s)]
*  I know that you can get tired readily, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=350.12s)]
*  and the concentration is difficult for that period of time. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=352.48s)]
*  — The stakes for this exchange are very high. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=356.32s)]
*  There's just not a lot of opportunity [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=358.52s)]
*  to clean up a messy performance. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=360.04s)]
*  It makes it all the more important [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=361.96s)]
*  that this one is perfect. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=364.16s)]
*  — Trump and Biden are tied among registered voters nationally, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=366.24s)]
*  according to recent polls. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=369.88s)]
*  And they're both facing heightened scrutiny. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=371.96s)]
*  Trump recently became the first former U.S. president [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=374.56s)]
*  ever convicted of felony crimes, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=377.68s)]
*  and Biden's age and mental acuity [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  have been a major concern for many voters. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=381.88s)]
*  — You have to be very careful when you're a debater. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=385.08000000000004s)]
*  You don't want to reinforce the negative things [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=387.44s)]
*  that people already think about you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=390.28000000000003s)]
*  If the candidate behaves consistent [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=392.04s)]
*  with kind of low expectations [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=394.8s)]
*  that are set for either one of them, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=396.64s)]
*  that's going to reinforce those expectations, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=398.68s)]
*  and then it's going to be impossible to dispel that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  over the remainder of the campaign. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CcbWp5XBgE&t=404.52000000000004s)]
