# Copyright Lawyer Explains Drake AI Song and More  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g)
*  We're going to swap face here with Elvis and here comes South Indian Elvis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=0.0s)]
*  This is Reface, an app that lets users swap faces with others using AI. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=7.2s)]
*  And it's currently embroiled in a lawsuit. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=12.0s)]
*  It's one of dozens of AI-related lawsuits filed in the last couple of years. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=14.32s)]
*  I'm going to break down three of the biggest cases at the intersection of AI and intellectual property law. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=18.72s)]
*  Maybe the biggest issue facing copyright lawyers today is whether or not works created using generative AI tools are even protectable. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=26.08s)]
*  The case that illustrates this copyright conundrum, perhaps the best, is Thaler v. Perlmutter. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=34.96s)]
*  In 2018, scientist Dr. Steven Thaler applied for copyright protection for this piece of art, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=40.16s)]
*  which he said was produced by a generative AI system he created. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=46.0s)]
*  The Copyright Office rejected his application, saying creative works must have human authors to be copyrightable. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=50.16s)]
*  And so what the Copyright Office is basically saying is that we're not going to extend copyright protection to works that are made by machines. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=56.48s)]
*  Thaler sued over the rejection and lost, but he didn't give up. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=64.72s)]
*  He appealed the ruling and a decision is expected by the end of this year. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  The Copyright Office declined to comment. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  In order to receive copyright protection, a work needs to be original, fixed to a tangible medium, and have human authorship. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=74.88s)]
*  This element of human authorship is not really disputed, discussed, or litigated very often. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=82.72s)]
*  However, there was a case that got some headlines that did focus on this element of human authorship. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=90.72s)]
*  In 2011, wildlife photographer David Slater set up and left his camera unattended, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=98.32s)]
*  and a monkey named Nerudo allegedly took photos of himself with Slater's camera. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  PETA argued that Nerudo, not Slater, should be the lawful owner of the copyright. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=108.24s)]
*  Ultimately, the federal court said that photograph lacks human authorship because Nerudo is a monkey. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  And the rise of AI raises new questions. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  If a human edits artwork made by AI, can that count as human authorship? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=125.92s)]
*  Maybe the first case that actually spotted this copyright conundrum involves the artist and computer scientist named Chris Cashtanova. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  Cashtanova used the generative AI tool Mid Journey to create the artwork in their graphic novel. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=141.12s)]
*  They said they personally edited some of the artwork using Photoshop, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=146.56s)]
*  but the Copyright Office said the edits were too minor to be entitled to copyright. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=150.0s)]
*  The Copyright Office also said in its letter to Cashtanova that if there were a sufficient amount of original authorship made by a human, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=154.32s)]
*  that could warrant copyright protection. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  Cashtanova's attorney said in a statement that the Copyright Office's decision was incorrect and is unsustainable. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=164.0s)]
*  So why is all of this such a big deal? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=170.4s)]
*  Without the ability to get a copyright registration, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  people who are making work in this way will not be able to meaningfully commercialize that work. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=177.84s)]
*  I think either a federal appellate court is going to expand on the definition of what human authorship means, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  or I think Congress will be lobbied to a point where they will need to define again the meaning of human authorship as it maybe relates to contemporary society. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=195.44s)]
*  The definition of AI and right of publicity law is important right now. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=207.84s)]
*  AI as a technology has made it exceedingly easy to co-opt or repurpose somebody's name, image, and likeness for some kind of commercial purpose. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=212.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that sounds like Drake. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  But it isn't. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  It was made by an anonymous producer named Ghostwriter, who used generative AI tools to fake Drake and The Weeknd's voices. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  Ghostwriter's song, Heart on My Sleeve, had 600,000 plays on Spotify, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  before it was pulled down following a copyright infringement complaint from Universal Music Group. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=242.88s)]
*  And it isn't the only example. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=248.0s)]
*  Kyland Young, a former contestant on CBS's Big Brother, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=250.16s)]
*  What a fun opportunity to come back to more friends. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=253.44s)]
*  sued Neo Cortex, which owns the app Reface we saw earlier. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=256.88s)]
*  He said his face was in the app's library for paying users to edit without his consent, which violates his right of publicity. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=260.56s)]
*  Young's complaint says that the use of his image for commercial benefit is the core of the issue. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=267.68s)]
*  One example of this is a 1992 case involving Samsung. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=272.8s)]
*  When they ran this ad, I probably don't even have to tell you who that is. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=279.04s)]
*  And that is the problem. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=285.12s)]
*  The robot in the print ad is meant to look like Vanna White, a host on the game show Wheel of Fortune. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  In 1992, she sued Samsung for violating her right of publicity, and the court agreed. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=292.55999999999995s)]
*  That's the question that Kyland Young's lawsuit is wrestling with. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  I think Neo Cortex is going to have a very difficult time defeating this claim by Young. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=301.52s)]
*  Reface said Young's images are no longer available in the app. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=307.44s)]
*  The company argues that because the app's output is derivative, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=311.44s)]
*  the Copyright Act preempts Young's right of publicity claim. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=314.72s)]
*  Most of the actual lawsuits relate to this thing called training data. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=319.20000000000005s)]
*  Or the material used to create large language models that power generative AI systems like ChatGPT. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=325.68s)]
*  One of the first cases involving training data was filed by a group of artists in 2023. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=331.92s)]
*  What these artists are saying is that their copyrighted works, which live in digital form online, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=337.2s)]
*  are used and scraped to train the large language models used by Mid Journey, Stability AI, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  and the other defendants. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=351.92s)]
*  Since these artists never licensed their work to these defendants, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=353.12s)]
*  they argue that that use of their copyright work violates their copyright rights. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=358.0s)]
*  They also argue that the artwork produced by these AI systems should be considered [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  copyright infringement because of how similar they look to the originals. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  Substantial similarity is the legal standard used by courts to determine whether or not [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=371.76s)]
*  copyright infringement has occurred. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=377.35999999999996s)]
*  Courts will usually focus on the similarities, not the differences. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=379.2s)]
*  And they'll focus on the similarities of the protectable elements among each work. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=384.4s)]
*  Like the subjects in this Getty image and the angle of the camera. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=389.84s)]
*  Stability AI didn't respond to requests for comment. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=393.2s)]
*  I think that at the end of the day, the training standing alone is probably going to be OK. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=396.56s)]
*  And here's why. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  There is a case from a few years ago involving H-I-Q and LinkedIn. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=404.96s)]
*  H-I-Q was developing some recruiting software by scraping publicly available data from LinkedIn.com. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=409.52s)]
*  And what the court ultimately said in that case was scraping publicly available information is OK. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=417.28s)]
*  These platforms are still going to have to ensure that the output does not constitute copyright infringement. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=426.96s)]
*  There will likely be more of these copyright issues, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=435.11999999999995s)]
*  especially when OpenAI releases its text-to-video tool Sora to the public. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=437.52s)]
*  You can imagine now if somebody wants to create a cityscape of like Tokyo or New York City [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=442.0s)]
*  or Paris, right, they might end up actually creating modified but recognizable versions of famous trademarks. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=446.96s)]
*  OpenAI declined to comment. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=456.23999999999995s)]
*  The law is just beginning to catch up to the fast advancement of AI. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  Technology in general moves very fast and tests the bounds of the existing laws that we have. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  Oftentimes, it's these types of technologies and shifts in technology and culture [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=469.35999999999996s)]
*  that force us to rethink the law or reapply the law or ultimately even rewrite the law. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cds-p_QG1-g&t=474.72s)]
