# Trump’s Bill Passed: The Tax and Spending Updates, Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50)
*  The motion is adopted. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=0.0s)]
*  The House of Representatives passed President Trump's one big, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=3.48s)]
*  beautiful tax and spending bill. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=6.84s)]
*  Sort of celebrating like the biggest bill of its kind ever signed. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=8.6s)]
*  And it's going to make this country into a rocket ship. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=13.92s)]
*  It's going to be really great. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=16.4s)]
*  We're going to take you through some of the highlights of this bill. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=17.76s)]
*  They extended basically everything that was scheduled to expire as far as the 2017 tax cuts. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=20.84s)]
*  Back then, in President Trump's first term, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Congress set all these tax cuts to expire at the end of 2025. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=28.12s)]
*  Republicans really viewed those tax cuts as a huge success, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=32.32s)]
*  and they made it a priority to remove that expiration date. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=35.84s)]
*  The child tax credit has been $2,000. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=39.24s)]
*  This bill will make it $2,200 and index it to inflation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=42.44s)]
*  The estate tax, they increased the exemption, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=46.96s)]
*  so that's the per person amount that you don't have to pay estate taxes on, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  to $15 million per person. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=52.96s)]
*  Republicans really disfavored electric vehicles and clean energy tax credits. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=55.6s)]
*  Now, anything purchased after September 30th is not eligible for those credits. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=59.92s)]
*  On clean energy, the wind and solar in particular, taking a hit in this bill. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=64.4s)]
*  They're going to be phased out faster. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=68.08s)]
*  The state and local tax deduction has been capped at $10,000 since 2017. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=70.76s)]
*  There was a block of Republicans from New York, New Jersey, California in the House [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=75.76s)]
*  who wouldn't vote for this bill without a much higher cap. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=80.4s)]
*  What they got was $40,000. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=82.88s)]
*  It's a pretty significant amount. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=85.6s)]
*  That starts phasing down once income reaches $500,000. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=87.64s)]
*  This bill also includes some new items, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=92.6s)]
*  particularly ones that President Trump campaigned on last year [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=95.84s)]
*  when he was running for a second term. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  One is no tax on tips, up to a $25,000 deduction for tipped workers. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  Again, you're still going to pay payroll taxes on those, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  similar amounts for overtime pay. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  It's removing income taxes on the sort of half part of time and a half. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  So you'd still pay taxes on straight time, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=113.68s)]
*  but then the additional half increment you wouldn't necessarily pay income tax on, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=116.76s)]
*  you would get a deduction. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=119.92s)]
*  Car loan interest for domestically produced cars, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=121.48s)]
*  you'd be able to deduct thousands of dollars in interest. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=124.08s)]
*  The fourth is a deduction for seniors. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  So the president talks about this bill being making it [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=130.36s)]
*  so there's no tax on Social Security. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=133.88s)]
*  That is not in fact the case. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=135.56s)]
*  There's an approximation of that, an attempt to do something like that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=137.04s)]
*  It's a $6,000 per person deduction for people ages 65 and up. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=140.12s)]
*  Generally these provisions will all kick in for tax year 2025. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=144.72s)]
*  They are temporary. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=149.04s)]
*  They go from 2025 through 2028. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=150.44s)]
*  And we'll see how they go. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  We'll see who wins the 2026 and 2028 elections [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=155.88s)]
*  and how eager they are to continue those policies. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=159.88s)]
*  Republicans were looking for ways to get more money for their priorities. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=164.76000000000002s)]
*  So they were able to say, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=168.8s)]
*  okay, well we'll just take the agencies we like and favor [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=169.68s)]
*  and that Trump wants more money for. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=173.4s)]
*  ICE, Customs and Border Protection, Homeland Security, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  the Defense Department, Missile Defense, those kinds of things, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  and shipbuilding and just plus those up [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=181.84s)]
*  and add several hundred billion dollars that are going to all of those things. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=183.88s)]
*  One open question is what happens with the base levels of funding for those agencies, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=188.12s)]
*  whether Congress, this Congress or future Congresses, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=193.16s)]
*  particularly if Democrats have some more power, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=196.4s)]
*  start carving back some of the annual money for those agencies? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=198.52s)]
*  This dangerous and extreme Republican budget [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=202.64s)]
*  will result in Americans losing their lives. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=206.76s)]
*  The biggest point of contention is Medicaid, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=211.48s)]
*  which is the federal state health insurance program, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=214.04s)]
*  largely for low income people. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=216.12s)]
*  One of the things they did is create work requirements. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=217.92s)]
*  So able-bodied people will have to start looking for work or having work [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  in order to be able to get Medicaid work requirements. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=224.76s)]
*  Among the biggest single items saving money in this bill, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=227.92s)]
*  that's about $326 billion through 2034. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=231.16s)]
*  You also see more frequent eligibility checks in Medicaid. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  There are also changes to premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=237.44s)]
*  All those changes will mean that by 2034, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  11 million people will not have health insurance [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=243.68s)]
*  compared to what would happen if Congress did nothing here. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=246.44s)]
*  Republicans were concerned about the effect of that on the providers, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=249.2s)]
*  and so to deal with the changes they created, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  there's a $50 billion rural health care fund. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=254.04s)]
*  This bill represents, in the text of this bill, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=256.76s)]
*  the largest and greatest loss of health care in American history. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=260.6s)]
*  Democrats have highlighted in this bill is really the contrast [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=266.44s)]
*  between the effects on low income people [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=269.88s)]
*  who are receiving benefits from Medicaid and nutrition assistance [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=272.92s)]
*  and the tax cuts that go to some extent to tipped workers, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  but a lot of the money is certainly going to very high income people. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=280.36s)]
*  So if Democrats win the House Majority next year, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=284.12s)]
*  you may see them try to delay or change those tax cuts. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  It's going to add much more to the debt, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=291.16s)]
*  and so I think without question this is not a fiscally conservative bill. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=293.44s)]
*  This bill absolutely increases the deficit. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=297.88s)]
*  The way that Congress looks at this generally is, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  what happens to deficits over the next 10 years through 2034 [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=303.08s)]
*  if compared to a scenario where Congress does nothing? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=307.24s)]
*  That's about $3.4 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=309.84s)]
*  That's on top of the $21 trillion or so in budget deficits [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=313.4s)]
*  that would happen anyway. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  Republicans have sort of two very different arguments [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=318.12s)]
*  about why they think that's overstated. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=320.44s)]
*  One, and this is coming from the Senate, they say, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=323.28s)]
*  okay, look, let's just assume that the tax cuts [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=325.64s)]
*  were going to be extended anyway. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=328.36s)]
*  That's $3.8 trillion, and so really if you look at it that way, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=330.2s)]
*  this is reducing deficits by $400 billion. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=332.88s)]
*  The other way that House Republicans look at it is they say economic growth. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=335.0s)]
*  They argue that the tax cuts plus other Trump policies, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=339.08s)]
*  whether it's deregulation, energy production, those kinds of things, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  are going to speed up economic growth and throw off more tax revenue [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=345.92s)]
*  and therefore pay for a large chunk of this bill. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=350.64s)]
*  Economists outside of the White House are very concerned [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=354.0s)]
*  about the drag of budget deficits on the economy, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=357.24s)]
*  and they're worried about higher interest rates and growing pile of debt [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=359.72s)]
*  sort of counteracting that growth effect. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dy8SpX_50&t=363.64000000000004s)]
