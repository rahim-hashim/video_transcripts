# The Writers’ Strike Rocking Hollywood, Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA)
*  No contract. No peace. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=0.0s)]
*  For the first time in 15 years, more than 11,000 movie and television writers in Hollywood's Writers Guild went on strike. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=2.08s)]
*  Writers' Guild is coming! [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=9.6s)]
*  This is absolutely an existential moment for the writing profession. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=11.76s)]
*  We want to ensure that working on The Handmaid's Tale isn't the last good job that any of us has. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=14.44s)]
*  The decision brought productions to a halt and dealt a blow to an industry that's been rocked by the pandemic [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=21.72s)]
*  and the new ways people watch movies and television. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=27.32s)]
*  The industry is saying, we're still not sure where this is going. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=30.2s)]
*  We're losing money on these businesses. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=33.56s)]
*  This is not the time to be trying to squeeze us. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=35.64s)]
*  As hundreds of writers from Los Angeles to New York took to the picket lines, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=38.4s)]
*  we sat down with the writers and union members at the center of the strike to understand what led to this moment and what's next. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=42.52s)]
*  What do we want? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=49.6s)]
*  Fair contract! [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  The strike has pitted the Writers Guild of America, the WGA, against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the AMPTP, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=52.4s)]
*  which represents the major studios. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=59.92s)]
*  We came to the table with all these issues and what we got back really felt kind of like gaslighting. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=62.12s)]
*  Yalyn Chang is a showrunner on the Hulu series The Handmaid's Tale. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=68.64s)]
*  Blessed be the fruit. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=72.72s)]
*  She's also a member of the Writers Guild's negotiating committee. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  She was in the room when negotiations with the studios came to a head. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=77.28s)]
*  The companies came back refusing to engage with us on our core existential issues. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  The AMPTP did not respond to requests for comment about Chang's gaslighting accusations, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=89.24s)]
*  but studio executives say every effort was made to engage in meaningful discussions and bargaining. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=94.04s)]
*  Many of the issues dividing the two sides are tied to the ways streaming has completely transformed the industry. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=99.88s)]
*  As the studios moved towards a streaming model, it was an arms race. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=106.48s)]
*  Justin Helburn is a board member for the Writers Guild, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  as well as a showrunner and writer for the ABC sitcom Abbott Elementary. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=112.84s)]
*  I've been teaching here at Abbott Elementary for a year now. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=116.84s)]
*  The staff here is incredible. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=119.6s)]
*  Everybody was trying to amass the most amount of content, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=122.04s)]
*  as many shows as they could possibly kind of pump out to compete with all the other streaming services. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=125.04s)]
*  Then suddenly the orders of shows became much smaller. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=130.72s)]
*  The amount of weeks that they were asking writers to work also became much smaller. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=133.88s)]
*  In a network television show like Abbott Elementary, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=138.36s)]
*  a writer typically has enough work to support themselves for an entire year. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  Because we make 22 episodes of Abbott Elementary, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=145.4s)]
*  our writers are able to make a good living and live in Los Angeles. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=148.0s)]
*  We should not be the anomaly. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=152.4s)]
*  But in the new world of streaming, episode orders have declined to eight or 12. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  And unlike network shows, many stream shows don't go into production until most of the scripts are completely mapped out. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  There's this thing called mini rooms, which have taken over Hollywood. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  And it's the studios deciding, hey, we're going to put together a room of writers, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=169.6s)]
*  but you're not producing the show. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=175.44s)]
*  You're just like writing some scripts and breaking out the season, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  all of the hardest stuff there is to do in writing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=179.48s)]
*  And because you're not producing, we're not going to pay you the producing fee. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=182.6s)]
*  We're going to pay you the minimum, which is the least amount of money they can legally pay us. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  In response to the WGA's concerns, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=191.2s)]
*  the studios agreed to increase minimum rates for writers working in those types of development rooms. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=193.32s)]
*  Still, writers say this new production model has made screenwriting more like a gig economy job. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=198.52s)]
*  Between seasons one and two, we had a writer who had to drive an Uber. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=204.0s)]
*  Most shows, you'll have a writer who gets a 10-week gig or a 12-week gig, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=208.24s)]
*  and that could be it for the whole year. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=213.96s)]
*  That could be it for 18 months. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=215.64s)]
*  And a writer simply can't live on that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=217.68s)]
*  The studios say that employment as a writer has almost nothing in common with standard gig jobs. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=220.04s)]
*  The studios would argue that this is not a gig economy for starters. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=225.88s)]
*  The pension and health benefits are a lot better. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  And secondly, you're employed on a weekly, episodic basis, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  and you're getting paid every week a set wage. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=237.44s)]
*  The studios are also confronting a rapidly changing business. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=240.28s)]
*  Subscriber growth for many of the streaming companies has slowed, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=243.76s)]
*  and viewership has declined for network and cable shows. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=247.04s)]
*  They're always looking for places where they can trim costs, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=250.6s)]
*  whether it's reducing staffing within their own companies [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=253.36s)]
*  or finding ways to squeeze every penny out of a production budget. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=256.28s)]
*  The last time the Writers Guild of America went on strike against the Hollywood studios [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=260.32s)]
*  was in November 2007. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=264.36s)]
*  It lasted for 100 days. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=266.28s)]
*  The strike, centered on the way DVD sales and video on demand [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=271.84s)]
*  were quickly replacing rerun syndication as a main source of revenue. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=275.0s)]
*  The writers wanted their fair share of those profits. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=279.2s)]
*  We want our fair share! [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=282.44s)]
*  We're here because we care! [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=284.48s)]
*  The 0708 strike was incredibly successful because we won coverage of the internet. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=286.32s)]
*  So for all the shows that are streaming now, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=292.48s)]
*  it wouldn't be covered by our union if we had not struck. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=295.44s)]
*  In the moments before the recent negotiations reached a standstill, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=299.28s)]
*  the writers say they weren't the ones to end the talks. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=302.96s)]
*  It was the studios who came back and said, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=306.08s)]
*  if you don't give up on these countless proposals [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=309.4s)]
*  that are essential in courtier negotiation, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=314.2s)]
*  then there's no point in talking anymore. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=317.2s)]
*  So they were the ones who walked away, not us. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=319.67999999999995s)]
*  We were there. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=322.32s)]
*  We were there. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=323.52s)]
*  We had pizza. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=324.76s)]
*  We were waiting. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  The studios say that they listened to the WGA's proposals [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=327.64s)]
*  and presented the writers with a comprehensive offer. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=331.08000000000004s)]
*  The studios have prospered enormously from our shows. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=333.88s)]
*  The budget for writing for each show has stagnated [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=338.6s)]
*  while show budgets have ballooned. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=342.56s)]
*  The WGA says nearly half of guild writers working in television [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  are being paid minimum rates. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=348.6s)]
*  To address these concerns, the studios say they offered a substantial wage increase [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=350.68s)]
*  and created a higher floor for mid-level writers' compensation. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=355.04s)]
*  But the increases didn't meet the WGA's demands. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=358.84s)]
*  The WGA is trying to put protections into our contract for writers [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=362.11999999999995s)]
*  so that we can get a guaranteed number of weeks of pay [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=365.76s)]
*  at a minimum that allows us to live and work in Los Angeles. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=369.56s)]
*  The AMPTP said in a statement that its offer included [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=375.0s)]
*  generous increases in compensation for writers [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=378.32s)]
*  and that it was willing to keep negotiating. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=380.96s)]
*  The studios have offered increases in starting wages for writers. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=383.32s)]
*  They would tell you we've offered our most significant wage increase in 25 years. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=389.44s)]
*  And then there's the issue of residuals, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=395.64s)]
*  which are like royalty payments for screenwriters. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=397.4s)]
*  Writers are typically paid less in residuals for stream shows [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=399.76s)]
*  compared to those on broadcast TV. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=402.96s)]
*  The streamers have been very protective of their data, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=404.84s)]
*  so we have no idea how well shows are doing. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=408.76s)]
*  We have to take their word for it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=412.08s)]
*  We would like some sort of compensation that's tied to the success of the show. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  The AMPTP has provided some counteroffers, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=419.08s)]
*  but they did not meet the WGA's demands. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=421.91999999999996s)]
*  The studio streamers and networks, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  they have offered raises on residuals and on minimum wages. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=427.24s)]
*  Late-night shows were the first to feel the ripple effects of the strike, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=433.4s)]
*  with most heading into reruns. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=437.0s)]
*  I also feel very strongly that what the writers are asking for is not unreasonable. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=439.08s)]
*  Some content providers are in a better position than others to weather the strike. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=444.56s)]
*  Streaming services like Netflix and HBO Max all tend to make their shows far in advance, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=449.0s)]
*  but the fall TV season for broadcast networks could be delayed. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=454.91999999999996s)]
*  The writers' room for season three of Abbott was supposed to start May 2nd, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=458.88s)]
*  and we struck, and so we are not able to start our writers' room and get to work. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=464.04s)]
*  On the Handmaid's Tale, we were breaking and writing our final season. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=469.24s)]
*  When the strike hit, we just all closed down the room. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ex8srthHA&t=473.84000000000003s)]
