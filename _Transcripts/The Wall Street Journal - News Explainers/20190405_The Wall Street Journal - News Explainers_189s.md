# Why Food-Delivery Apps Could Leave Restaurants Footing the Bill  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 05, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg)
*  Delivery is picking up steam in the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=0.0s)]
*  Analysts project a steady increase in the share of delivery sales at restaurants over [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=4.24s)]
*  the next several years. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  But what's convenient for customers might not be best for the restaurants. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=11.4s)]
*  Part of the challenge is the cost of working with third-party apps, which analysts say [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=15.76s)]
*  will be servicing many of these orders. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=19.68s)]
*  But this trend is hitting a nerve in the restaurant business. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=22.52s)]
*  These bar charts can help explain why. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=26.84s)]
*  This analysis compares meal prices for cost for in-store service and delivery by a third-party [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=29.16s)]
*  app. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=34.5s)]
*  When restaurants serve food in their store, their margins are up to 69% of the total check. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=35.5s)]
*  And the same meal ordered via an app? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=40.44s)]
*  Well that's the price of convenience for you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Additional costs in labor, packing, and fees to the apps make the profit margin sink to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  39% of the total check. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=51.68s)]
*  On average, food sellers will pay third-party services a fee of 10-25% on each order. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=54.56s)]
*  Vendors who partner with third-party apps also lose control over valuable customer data. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=60.92s)]
*  For restaurants who want to bypass third-party apps and still get into the delivery game, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=66.56s)]
*  there are other costs. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  Consider Panera's delivery business. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=72.12s)]
*  The chain spent six years building it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=74.56s)]
*  It cost upwards of $100 million to develop its online ordering system. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=76.68s)]
*  That investment cut into profits for three years, but the effort began to pay off in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=81.46s)]
*  2016. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=85.74s)]
*  Today, each delivery costs about $5 after accounting for labor, gas, and packaging. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=87.22s)]
*  But to avoid turning away customers, Panera charges a flat delivery fee of $3 per order [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=93.58s)]
*  in most markets. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=98.46s)]
*  This means that they have to sell a lot more per order to absorb those costs. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=99.83999999999999s)]
*  Many smaller restaurants can't afford that kind of investment. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=104.82s)]
*  Order-taking systems must be developed. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=108.38s)]
*  Drivers have to be hired. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=110.58s)]
*  A third-party app might take care of those logistics, but they take a commission. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=112.17999999999999s)]
*  And typically, customers aren't keen to pay the difference. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=116.7s)]
*  According to a survey by Tilster, 85% of consumers aren't willing to pay more than $5 for restaurant [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=120.94s)]
*  delivery. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=126.78s)]
*  And customers may wind up unhappy anyway because many restaurants sell food that doesn't travel [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=128.02s)]
*  well. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=132.94s)]
*  This analysis from Cohen & Co. reveals a rise in the share of orders from steakhouses and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=134.46s)]
*  burger chains. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=138.9s)]
*  Delivery staples like pizza or Indian foods are losing pace. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=140.70000000000002s)]
*  But the businesses that previously dominated the delivery market sold food that can stay [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=145.58s)]
*  tasty for longer periods of time. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=149.66s)]
*  Whereas say, french fries, prepped in store, probably won't make it to your doorstep, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=152.62s)]
*  tasting their best. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=157.62s)]
*  And when that order of fries shows up cold, consumers tend to blame the food seller, even [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  if it was delivered by a third-party app. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=163.70000000000002s)]
*  Despite the shortcomings, the rise of delivery seems inevitable. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=167.54s)]
*  Though the field is crowded, third-party delivery platforms are expected to rise in value over [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=171.01999999999998s)]
*  the next few years. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=175.42s)]
*  Which means that like it or not, many urban restaurants may soon have to embrace a brave [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=177.1s)]
*  new world of food delivery. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlnIHP7ZCVg&t=181.18s)]
