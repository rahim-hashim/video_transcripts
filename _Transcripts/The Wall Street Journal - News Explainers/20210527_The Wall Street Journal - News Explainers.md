# How the Brain Weighs Risk as Covid-19 Restrictions Ease  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 27, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs)
*  After more than a year of living with COVID-19 safety precautions, quarantines, and social isolation, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=0.0s)]
*  life is starting to return back to pre-COVID normal. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=8.0s)]
*  And that's forcing our brains to rethink how we behave socially. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=12.0s)]
*  Now we have to make individual decisions about what are environments in which we feel comfortable [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=16.0s)]
*  and what are environments where we don't feel comfortable. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=21.0s)]
*  Should I eat indoors? Go to that concert? Wear my mask? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=23.0s)]
*  A new mental toll is emerging. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=28.0s)]
*  Many people are re-evaluating the habits they formed during the pandemic [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=31.0s)]
*  and reassessing how safe it is to resume once normal activities. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=36.0s)]
*  But why do some of us find it difficult to make these choices? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=41.0s)]
*  It has to do with how our brains process information. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=45.0s)]
*  Let's take a look at what happens when you're finally reunited with friends and you're faced with a choice. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=48.0s)]
*  Mia is in her 40s, healthy, fully vaccinated, and is attending a backyard barbecue party. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=55.0s)]
*  But it starts to rain, and the party moves indoors. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=62.0s)]
*  Though CDC guidelines say the risk of infection is minimal for people like Mia who are fully vaccinated, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=66.0s)]
*  she has to decide whether she feels comfortable going indoors with a big group of people. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=72.0s)]
*  When we're making those decisions in our brains, what we're really doing is weighing three sets of factors. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=77.0s)]
*  The first factor is almost the easiest to understand, and that's what risks am I willing to take when I understand the risks completely? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=81.0s)]
*  Making a choice can happen quickly, as several parts of the brain work together to come to a decision. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=88.0s)]
*  When people begin to move indoors, Mia faces a known risk, the chance she could get exposed to COVID-19. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=93.0s)]
*  Her prefrontal cortex starts to assess that risk and the possible outcomes of her actions. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=100.0s)]
*  The second is uncertainty aversion, things that are ambiguous and obscure. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=106.0s)]
*  That assessment happens in part in the amygdala, which is associated with processing fear, distress, or anxiety. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=111.0s)]
*  The more ambiguous a situation is, the more likely someone is to be cautious. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=118.0s)]
*  For Mia, the ambiguous risk is tied to how much she doesn't know. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=123.0s)]
*  Is everyone vaccinated? How high are infection rates in town? Is there enough ventilation in the house? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=128.0s)]
*  If she has a good handle on all this information, her ambiguous risk is lower, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=134.0s)]
*  and she may opt in favor of the reward to go inside and continue spending time with her friends. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=139.0s)]
*  The third factor is the habit system. That's located in the dorsal striatum, near the amygdala. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=145.0s)]
*  When we come into an environment that we've been to a million times before the pandemic, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=152.0s)]
*  and we have some set of behaviors that we've learned to produce in those environments, like walking up to someone and hugging them, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=156.0s)]
*  these habits are going to also influence our behavior. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=163.0s)]
*  Prior to the pandemic, Mia used to hang out at her friends' homes regularly. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=166.0s)]
*  But COVID changed a lot of her habits. She only saw people outdoors. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=171.0s)]
*  In each of these brain areas, there are millions of brain cells. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=176.0s)]
*  And those brain cells generate action potentials, these little electrochemical impulses, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=182.0s)]
*  with which they send information from one part of the brain to another. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=187.0s)]
*  So as Mia weighs her choice, the brain is calculating the risk and reward of going inside versus going home. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=191.0s)]
*  In the final stage of decision making, information from multiple parts of the brain is integrated to make a final choice. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=199.0s)]
*  This includes the prefrontal cortex at the very front of the brain, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=207.0s)]
*  and the ventral striatum, a neighboring region to the dorsal striatum and amygdala. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=211.0s)]
*  So there is where we find groups of nerve cells that represent each of the options [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=216.0s)]
*  and have aggregated together all of the different factors that are going to influence how much you like or don't like doing that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=222.0s)]
*  And then in these areas, in areas closely associated with them, that's where we expect to see this competition, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=229.0s)]
*  where the group of cells that is most active, the ones that are encoding the more desirable option, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=235.0s)]
*  with greater electrochemical activity, will sort of take control and lead us to the behavior that we've chosen to make. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=242.0s)]
*  But we're all different. Our personalities, age, and life experiences influence all three systems uniquely. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=248.0s)]
*  So what Mia decides could be different from her friend Mark. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=256.0s)]
*  Some of us are more concerned about ambiguity, maybe because of prior life trauma. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=260.0s)]
*  Some of us are more concerned about risk, and some of us are more driven by habits. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=264.0s)]
*  So there are individual differences in the way we weigh each of these three sets of factors. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=269.0s)]
*  And then, of course, we all have different inputs from the world around us. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=274.0s)]
*  Another factor that could influence our decisions over the next few months may be related to trauma from the pandemic. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=278.0s)]
*  Dr. Glimcher is actively studying how the events of the last year can affect our choices. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=285.0s)]
*  He says there's still a lot of unknowns, but... [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=290.0s)]
*  We do know that while trauma changes the way people decide and changes the way people behave, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=293.0s)]
*  it makes them more ambiguity averse, for example, it doesn't completely disorder the brain. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=298.0s)]
*  The basic rules and structures for making decisions remain the same. It's the weightings that are different. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=303.0s)]
*  So for Mark, who lost his grandfather to COVID-19, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=310.0s)]
*  the decision of whether to stay or leave the party could be weighted differently due to that trauma. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=314.0s)]
*  As the pandemic eases in many parts of the world, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=320.0s)]
*  it's unclear how trauma and fear associated with the past year will continue to impact people's lives. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=323.0s)]
*  But the brain is flexible. It constantly learns from experience. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=330.0s)]
*  And as we're testing our boundaries of what feels safe and what doesn't, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=334.0s)]
*  we're learning to adjust to old situations that now feel new. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=338.0s)]
*  It's that learning that will ultimately help us get back to a new normal. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ofeOFVJBs&t=342.0s)]
