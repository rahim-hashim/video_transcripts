# Why Investors Are Obsessed With the Inverted Yield Curve
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 04, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI)
*  When markets get shaky, investors and economists start talking about the yield curve. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, the flattening yield curve has been kind of an overhang. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=6.0s)]
*  Inverted yield curve, yikes. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=9.0s)]
*  Inverted yield curves can often, but not always, predict a recession. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=11.0s)]
*  The reason? When the curve inverts, investors see it as an omen for an economic recession. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=16.0s)]
*  But what exactly is the yield curve? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=22.0s)]
*  To understand the yield curve, first you have to understand bonds. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=30.0s)]
*  A bond is a chunk of money an investor lends to a company or a government, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=34.0s)]
*  with the agreement that over time, they'll be repaid with interest. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=39.0s)]
*  The interest, or the amount of money the investor earns annually per $100 of bonds, is called the yield. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=43.0s)]
*  The yield curve measures the yields of all the bonds the Treasury is selling over a long period of time. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=51.0s)]
*  The x-axis shows when the bonds will be repaid, how many months, years, or decades, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=57.0s)]
*  and the y-axis measures the yield, or the interest that bondholders receive annually. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=63.0s)]
*  Here's what a normal, healthy yield curve looks like. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=69.0s)]
*  This means the economy is expanding. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=72.0s)]
*  You can see that when the market is healthy, longer-term bonds trade at a higher yield, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=75.0s)]
*  and shorter-term bonds trade at a lower one. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=80.0s)]
*  So in a healthy yield curve, a two-year bond might yield 3% annually, and a 10-year bond might get 4%. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=84.0s)]
*  Investors and economists look at the way the curve bends to predict the health of the economy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=92.0s)]
*  So what causes the yield curve to change shape and invert? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=98.0s)]
*  There are two levers. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=103.0s)]
*  The first is the Fed, which influences short-term bonds on the left side of the curve. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=106.0s)]
*  In a booming economy, the Fed raises short-term interest rates, also known as yields, to rein in borrowing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=112.0s)]
*  They're trying to limit inflation, which can get out of hand when too many people are borrowing [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=119.0s)]
*  and economic growth is moving too quickly. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=124.0s)]
*  But when the economy is stagnant, the Fed often will lower rates to encourage borrowing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=127.0s)]
*  Right now, the Fed is slowly, slowly raising rates. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=133.0s)]
*  The markets have been trending up for the past 10 years, and unemployment is way down, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=138.0s)]
*  so they're betting it's time to raise rates and restrict borrowing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=143.0s)]
*  Investor sentiment controls the right side of the chart. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=148.0s)]
*  When investors think the economy's in good shape, they take money out of long-term bonds [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=151.0s)]
*  and instead pour their money into riskier assets, like stocks. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=156.0s)]
*  The lower demand causes the price of bonds to sink, pushing up the yield. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=160.0s)]
*  This is an important point. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=167.0s)]
*  The price of a bond is inversely related to the yield, so when bond prices sink, the yields rise, and vice versa. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=169.0s)]
*  But when investors think the economy is headed for a rough patch, they pull their money out of stocks [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=176.0s)]
*  and put it somewhere safer, like long-term bonds. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=181.0s)]
*  This causes yields to drop. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=184.0s)]
*  That started to happen at the end of 2018. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=186.0s)]
*  Investors worried that the global economy was slowing down, and they put more money in long-term bonds. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=189.0s)]
*  Yields, which had been above 3% on 10-year treasuries, fell closer to 2.5%. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=195.0s)]
*  It sounds like a small difference, but that's almost a 20% change. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=201.0s)]
*  This is the key to reading the yield chart. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=206.0s)]
*  When short-term interest rates go up and investor sentiment goes down, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=209.0s)]
*  the yield curve starts to flatten, and it can eventually invert. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=213.0s)]
*  Investors view this as a bad omen. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=217.0s)]
*  Just look at this chart. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=219.0s)]
*  Every time the yield curve dips below zero, a recession follows. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=221.0s)]
*  So what does the yield curve look like today? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=227.0s)]
*  Here's the yield curve in January 2018, and here it is now. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=230.0s)]
*  You can see it's flattening. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=235.0s)]
*  This is a big deal for the markets, and perhaps the strongest signal yet that we're headed toward a bear market. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=238.0s)]
*  But we're not there yet. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=245.0s)]
*  The curve is pretty flat, but it's not inverted. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=247.0s)]
*  That means for now, there's no reason to believe a recession is imminent. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=250.0s)]
*  But if investors put more and more money in long-term bonds, and if the Fed keeps raising rates, that could change. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItazfbSptI&t=254.0s)]
