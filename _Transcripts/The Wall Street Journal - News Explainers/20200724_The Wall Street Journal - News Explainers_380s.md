# What It Would Take to Reach Herd Immunity  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 24, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg)
*  We know that COVID-19 spreads through close contact, making crowded areas potentially [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=0.0s)]
*  deadly. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=7.08s)]
*  But when some members of a crowd are immune, that begins to change. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=8.08s)]
*  This is called herd immunity. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=13.16s)]
*  It's what's protecting much of the population from diseases like measles and polio, and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  it's what's driving vaccine efforts today. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=20.84s)]
*  The notion is there will be enough people in that community who are immune so that when [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=23.68s)]
*  you go to pass the disease on, you won't be able to pass it on in a way that it will [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=27.44s)]
*  propagate. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=33.0s)]
*  Economies around the world could then safely reopen, and some say it could put an end to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  the pandemic. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  But the path to herd immunity includes big hurdles, and experts say it could take years [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  or more if we get there at all. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=45.56s)]
*  We'll explain. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=48.28s)]
*  When scientists want to determine how fast a virus might spread, they look at its reproduction [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=52.96s)]
*  number. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=57.88s)]
*  This represents how many people could catch the virus from a single infected person when [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=58.88s)]
*  no one in the population is immune. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=63.6s)]
*  That helps us to understand how much additional immunity or other measures do we need to implement [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=66.36s)]
*  in place to start to bring this epidemic under control, as opposed to having it expand over [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=74.08s)]
*  time. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=79.92s)]
*  For the polio virus, one infected person will pass the disease to five to seven people on [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=81.44s)]
*  average. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=87.16s)]
*  And from there, the disease will spread exponentially. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=88.28s)]
*  For the novel coronavirus, scientists say an infected person will likely spread it to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=91.78s)]
*  two to four other people. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=96.52s)]
*  That number can go down as more people become immune or also in response to measures like [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=98.44s)]
*  wearing masks, social distancing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=106.56s)]
*  When enough people in a population gain immunity, the chances of infecting others goes down. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=109.36s)]
*  And once it falls below a certain point, it becomes harder and harder for the virus to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=114.84s)]
*  spread. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=119.12s)]
*  As a result, the majority of the community becomes protected, not just those who are [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=120.2s)]
*  immune. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=124.72s)]
*  Over time, the virus dissipates and really essentially goes away or circulates at very [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=125.8s)]
*  low levels in that community. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=131.04s)]
*  Scientists say there are two ways a population can reach herd immunity. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=133.4s)]
*  Through broad infection or more commonly, vaccination. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=137.48s)]
*  To get there through infection, the majority of a population needs to get sick from a virus [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=141.2s)]
*  and develop molecular defenses like antibodies that fight off the disease. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=146.28s)]
*  But this method would be deadly. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  Experts estimate that less than 5% of people worldwide have had COVID-19. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=153.72s)]
*  Yet scientists say to reach herd immunity, that number would have to be between 60 and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=158.83999999999997s)]
*  70%. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=164.12s)]
*  If we need to get to 60 or 70% infections, that's obviously more than, you know, 4 billion [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=165.56s)]
*  people getting infected. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=171.6s)]
*  That would be tens of millions of people dying. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=173.6s)]
*  It would be hundreds of millions of people getting very, very sick. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=176.72s)]
*  It would be devastating. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=179.68s)]
*  It would be devastating for the entire global population. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=180.68s)]
*  It would be devastating for the economies. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=182.88s)]
*  And it is wholly unnecessary. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=184.86s)]
*  There's also no guarantee that broad infection would lead to eradication. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=187.16s)]
*  We don't have many examples of complete immunity to viruses through natural infection because [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=191.72s)]
*  people continue to get born in a population. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=199.68s)]
*  So every year you have a new set of babies who are born and they're going to be susceptible [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=201.96s)]
*  to that infection. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=206.92s)]
*  Experts say the more efficient way to herd immunity is through vaccination. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=208.8s)]
*  That's how scientists eradicated smallpox. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=213.16s)]
*  Because of vaccines, childhood mortality has dropped dramatically. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=216.12s)]
*  Kids no longer die of measles. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=219.28s)]
*  They don't die of a lot of the diseases that kids used to die of. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=220.68s)]
*  Obviously smallpox was one of the horrible scourges of humanity throughout the entire [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=225.32s)]
*  human history. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=229.28s)]
*  We don't talk about smallpox anymore because our vaccination campaign ultimately led to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=230.8s)]
*  the eradication of smallpox. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=235.84s)]
*  But experts say they don't know enough about the coronavirus to predict the likelihood [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=238.22s)]
*  of reaching herd immunity and that there are large barriers to getting there, even with [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=242.84s)]
*  a vaccine. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=247.4s)]
*  One challenge is that scientists don't yet know how long natural immunity might last. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=249.36s)]
*  There's a big difference between being immune for six months and being immune for ten years. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=254.56s)]
*  For other respiratory viruses like the flu, antibodies tend to decrease over time. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=261.0s)]
*  Scientists have observed this in some patients recovering from COVID-19. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=267.0s)]
*  But there isn't enough data yet to be certain about what that means for immunity. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=270.92s)]
*  How long a COVID-19 vaccine will last is still unclear. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=275.24s)]
*  But it may be measured in months or years rather than a lifetime. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=279.16s)]
*  Another challenge? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=283.56s)]
*  Not all vaccines in development will work the same and their effectiveness could differ. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=284.6s)]
*  The better a vaccine is in terms of the level of protection and the duration of protection, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=289.76000000000005s)]
*  the further it gets you towards that point of herd immunity. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=297.36s)]
*  But even a less than perfect vaccine, if given to enough people in the population, can help [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=302.36s)]
*  reduce the spread. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=311.16s)]
*  Scientists are working quickly to test dozens of vaccines already in development. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=314.2s)]
*  But it could take years to figure out which ones are more effective. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=318.64s)]
*  So even if people get vaccinated, some could be more susceptible to catching the virus. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=322.12s)]
*  But even as cases surge around the world, some experts are optimistic. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=327.2s)]
*  We suspect that people who have gotten COVID-19 remain protected for many months at least [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=331.88s)]
*  because we haven't seen a large number of repeat infections. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=338.2s)]
*  We also know that it's possible to give people multiple vaccinations. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  So I'm hopeful that we can develop over time a vaccine that even if we do need to give [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=347.64s)]
*  multiple doses, will be highly effective in generating the levels of immunity that we [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=354.2s)]
*  need to beat this disease. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  If this happens, global herd immunity may be possible. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=364.56s)]
*  But until then, health experts of stress that measures like social distancing and wearing [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=368.24s)]
*  masks will be key to slowing down the spread. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaI20-T2GNg&t=373.0s)]
