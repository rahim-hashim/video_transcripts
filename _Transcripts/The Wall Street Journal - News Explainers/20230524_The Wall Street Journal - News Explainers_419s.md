# The $1.2 Billion Vinyl Industry's Rise, Fall and Rebirth, Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU)
*  I'm gonna get that. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the one I wanted. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=2.24s)]
*  Mike Shinoda co-founded the band Linkin Park, one of the best-selling acts of the 21st century. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=3.52s)]
*  One thing I don't know why It doesn't even matter how hard you try [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=9.24s)]
*  All my first beats were sampled off of vinyl records. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=14.8s)]
*  Lately, he's sold a lot of vinyl records. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=18.12s)]
*  And he likes to buy them. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Dude, now that's what I call rock. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  He's not alone. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=26.36s)]
*  Vinyl albums outsold CDs last year for the first time since 1987 to the tune of $1.2 billion. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=27.6s)]
*  In today's digital era, people can hear hundreds of millions of songs anywhere. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=35.84s)]
*  And yet vinyl, expensive, immobile, and left for dead is booming. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=40.72s)]
*  It was kind of like, well, yeah, that's never coming back. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=47.24s)]
*  I was wrong. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=51.88s)]
*  I didn't foresee it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=52.88s)]
*  No physical formats ever came back until this one did. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=54.12s)]
*  Here's why this antique format is coming back, both in spite of and because of the digital [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=61.04s)]
*  music revolution. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=67.96s)]
*  In the beginning of the beginning, around the very early part of the 20th century, there [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  were wax cylinders that carried sound recording. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=75.16s)]
*  Thomas Edison's phonograph introduced recorded music to the masses. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=78.92s)]
*  Eventually, it used discs like this. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=83.72s)]
*  These little black pellets are ultimately melted down and it becomes a biscuit that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=91.96s)]
*  gets pressed into a record. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=96.8s)]
*  Mark Michaels is the CEO and owner of the largest press in America, United Record Pressing [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=98.4s)]
*  in Nashville. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  Back in the 60s and 70s when vinyl was really the only format that was relevant and it was [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  the core existence of United, it was a very, very busy place. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=111.76s)]
*  But the format had its limitations. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=115.56s)]
*  And you couldn't really listen to it on the way to work or while you were doing anything [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  else. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=121.84s)]
*  And so CDs were far more convenient. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=122.84s)]
*  In 1987, CDs outsold vinyl records for the first time. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  We almost exclusively listened to CDs at the time. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=130.36s)]
*  And vinyl, we thought of it as like that was an old people's thing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=133.0s)]
*  The format hit its lowest point in 2006 as iPods helped digital music take over. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=136.8s)]
*  When I bought the company in 2007, it was a much smaller business. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  We were 38 employees at the time. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=147.42000000000002s)]
*  Music lovers had nearly unlimited options. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=149.84s)]
*  Vinyl seemed dead. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=153.36s)]
*  Nobody thought vinyl was going to come back except for the hardest of the hardcore. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=154.72000000000003s)]
*  But in the early 2010s, it did. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=159.36s)]
*  We could ask the question, why did that happen? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=162.10000000000002s)]
*  All of the music that has ever been recorded is available to almost all of us on our phones. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=165.32s)]
*  There was something missing in that experience. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=171.98s)]
*  The album isn't just about the music. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=173.88s)]
*  The answer lies in the way we express fandom. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=176.12s)]
*  I think a lot of fans see buying things from their favorite artists as keeping those artists [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  going. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, United watched demand skyrocket. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  We grew to 90 to 100 people. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=191.2s)]
*  We went from running one and a half shifts to three shifts. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=193.02s)]
*  We did everything we could to accommodate the growth. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=196.94s)]
*  It cost about the same as a black t-shirt at a concert and less than a hoodie. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=199.56s)]
*  And it contains the actual music and beautiful graphics and photography and lyrics and other stuff. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=204.98000000000002s)]
*  And so for many fans, especially young ones, they consider that to be a pretty good trade. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=211.74s)]
*  Lincoln Park's 2023 reissue of their album Meteora sold more than three times as many [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=217.1s)]
*  vinyl copies as the 2020 reissue of Hybrid Theory. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=222.7s)]
*  The CD sales of Hybrid Theory 20th anniversary were around 13,000-ish. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=226.94s)]
*  The vinyl was around 3,000-ish. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=232.1s)]
*  And by the time we got to Meteora two years later, it flip-flopped. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=234.42s)]
*  To jump from one format so heavily weighted to the other in a couple years' time is pretty substantial. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=237.22s)]
*  And those substantial vinyl sales are helping the artists' bottom lines. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=243.58s)]
*  On-demand streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music and Amazon and so on are paying [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=248.26000000000002s)]
*  out something well under a penny a stream. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=253.62s)]
*  Artists are making significantly more on a per-unit basis from record sales. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=257.54s)]
*  And it stands to reason, right? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=263.26s)]
*  I mean, today, a vinyl record is going to cost somewhere between $25 and $30 per disc. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=264.58000000000004s)]
*  And many fans prefer the sound of vinyl. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=272.86s)]
*  There's more life to it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=279.74s)]
*  It draws me in. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=280.98s)]
*  I don't get tired of it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=281.98s)]
*  I want to listen to it more. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=283.14s)]
*  If I got a record at like a garage sale or something and it's an actually, it's an [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=288.21999999999997s)]
*  old record with dust and scratches and it's got that sound, then to me it's a really [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=292.34s)]
*  different experience. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=297.38s)]
*  While vinyl is rebounding, revenue from physical formats made up just 11% of recorded revenue [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=298.74s)]
*  in 2022. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=304.86s)]
*  Vinyl's continued growth isn't guaranteed because records are really hard to manufacture. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=308.42s)]
*  And most machines are basically antiques. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=314.58s)]
*  These are some of our legacy lended presses, again, 50 to 60 years old. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=317.90000000000003s)]
*  And one of the challenges with these presses is, you know, they break. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=321.7s)]
*  And that can create a backlog for artists and labels. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=325.66s)]
*  Linkin Park is not like a fair comparison because the label does prioritize our projects. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=329.26000000000005s)]
*  Our wait time to get the vinyl done was six months. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=336.1s)]
*  So I have to imagine for a lot of other artists, it's a lot slower. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=338.86s)]
*  It's very, very difficult for an independent artist or for an independent label to schedule [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=342.94000000000005s)]
*  the manufacturing and release of a relatively small run of vinyl with great precision. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=350.1s)]
*  But the industry is catching up. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=356.98s)]
*  New equipment is finally being produced. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=358.82s)]
*  Mark just had 26 new presses delivered from Sweden. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=361.42s)]
*  For the last two years we've been putting this together. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=364.62s)]
*  It's an $11 million project. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=368.18s)]
*  Now United presses 60,000 records a day and has 234 employees. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=370.18s)]
*  Despite the challenges, some industry professionals think the format is here to stay. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=376.26s)]
*  As long as there is demand for a bespoke, analog way for a consumer to connect to an [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=381.42s)]
*  artist, vinyl will continue to be a significant and growing part of the business. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=388.9s)]
*  I don't know that it'll stick. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=395.9s)]
*  It'll beat CDs or beat other formats forever. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=397.5s)]
*  But for now, at least people know that when they're buying an album they love on vinyl, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=400.26s)]
*  they're buying it for a reason. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=404.38s)]
*  It's a keepsake, it's a collectible. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=405.58s)]
*  That's more of the mentality. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocdHzCwotU&t=408.46000000000004s)]
