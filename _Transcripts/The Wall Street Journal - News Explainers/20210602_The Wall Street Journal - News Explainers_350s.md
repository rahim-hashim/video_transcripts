# What Your Breakfast Can Tell You About Inflation Worries | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 02, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ)
*  Your breakfast may be getting more expensive. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Across the board, Americans are paying more for food. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=3.3000000000000003s)]
*  Since last year, the cost of bacon has gone up by over 10%, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  6.2% for fresh fruit, and 0.2% for cereal. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=10.16s)]
*  It may not seem like a lot, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=14.56s)]
*  but all of these little increases add up. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=15.76s)]
*  And it's not just food, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=18.12s)]
*  it's goods and services across the economy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=19.48s)]
*  After years of low inflation that hovered around 2%, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=22.16s)]
*  the Consumer Price Index, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=25.04s)]
*  the benchmark measure of inflation in the US, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=26.48s)]
*  jumped 4.2% in April from the year before. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=29.28s)]
*  These increases are often felt at the grocery store, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=32.94s)]
*  which is why it's affecting the price of your breakfast. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=35.68s)]
*  This has created a lot of concern [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=38.56s)]
*  over whether higher prices are a temporary blip [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=40.3s)]
*  or here to stay. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=42.96s)]
*  During this time of reopening, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=44.6s)]
*  we are likely to see some upward pressure on prices. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=46.74s)]
*  So here's why you're paying more for your breakfast [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=49.84s)]
*  and whether the current price jumps [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=52.38s)]
*  are a bellwether of inflation to come. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=53.86s)]
*  A major factor for increased food prices is corn, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=56.4s)]
*  which has soared roughly 50% in 2021. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=59.36s)]
*  Even if you don't have corn flakes for breakfast, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=62.56s)]
*  many foods have ingredients derived from the grain [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  or come from animals who eat it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  Corn makes up over 96% of all animal feed grain production [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=69.0s)]
*  in the US. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=72.88s)]
*  And around one fifth of the US crop [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=74.2s)]
*  is exported to other countries, like China. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=76.08s)]
*  Right now, the country is on a corn buying binge. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=79.16s)]
*  Farmers are racing to fatten millions of hogs [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=81.84s)]
*  to replace the pigs it had to kill during the 2020 outbreak [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  of African swine fever. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=87.04s)]
*  It's expected to import about four times more corn [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=88.76s)]
*  in 2021, mostly from US farmers. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=91.72s)]
*  On top of that, drought and corn producing regions [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=94.88s)]
*  in South America have led to disappointing crop yields [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=97.2s)]
*  and logistical problems. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=99.84s)]
*  In Argentina, multiple years of drought [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=101.56s)]
*  have made the Paraná River too shallow [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=103.84s)]
*  for boats fully loaded with grain [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  to pass from the country's interior [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=107.4s)]
*  to Atlantic shipping lands. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  Simply put, the high prices of corn [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=110.68s)]
*  Simply put, the higher demand for feed corn from China [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=113.4s)]
*  and smaller supply from South America [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=116.04s)]
*  means more expensive sausage and bacon. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  But that's not all that corn is doing [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  to raise the price for your breakfast. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  It's also making it more expensive [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=125.48s)]
*  to ship food across the country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  About 10% of the gasoline consumed in the United States [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=129.36s)]
*  is ethanol, which is made from corn. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=132.28s)]
*  So the rise in price for the grain [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=134.4s)]
*  has contributed to higher gas prices. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=136.20000000000002s)]
*  But also finding truck drivers to move the food [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=138.8s)]
*  has been difficult. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=141.44s)]
*  Shipping demand for truck freight has risen [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=143.04s)]
*  as the economy has emerged from lockdowns. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  To lure new recruits, trucking companies have raised pay, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=148.32s)]
*  further driving up the price of shipping. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=151.44s)]
*  Kellogg's maker of cereal brands like Frosted Flakes [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  has said that higher shipping costs [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  have contributed to it raising prices. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  And those shipping problems [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=160.88s)]
*  haven't stopped at the water's edge. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=162.12s)]
*  Ocean Freight has made it more expensive to ship sugar, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=164.36s)]
*  whose price has risen over 3%. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=167.24s)]
*  The global supply chain slowdown last year, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=170.52s)]
*  as well as the closing of the Suez Canal in March, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=172.72s)]
*  have backed up shipping for months. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=175.32000000000002s)]
*  But economists say food prices are not the best indicator [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=177.88s)]
*  for tracking inflation across the entire economy. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=180.72s)]
*  There are a few reasons for that, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=183.88s)]
*  according to senior Wall Street Journal economics writer, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=185.52s)]
*  John Hilsenrath. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=187.96s)]
*  It's a very goods-oriented sector of the economy, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=189.16000000000003s)]
*  as opposed to a labor-oriented sector of the economy, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  like a service sector, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=196.28s)]
*  where labor costs really drive the cost of the product. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=198.72s)]
*  A more telling indicator for broader inflation [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  might be what you're paying for that same breakfast [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=205.64s)]
*  at a restaurant. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=208.0s)]
*  While overall food prices have jumped 2.4% from a year ago, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  restaurant meals have gone up 3.8%. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=213.0s)]
*  One reason is restaurants just have more expenses. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=215.6s)]
*  For example, takeout trays became more costly [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=218.2s)]
*  after a February winter storm [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=220.6s)]
*  knocked out plastics production in Texas. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=222.28s)]
*  And another reason is the increased cost of labor. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  Rising vaccination rates, easing lockdowns, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  and federal stimulus aid have boosted consumer spending. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  Yet employers, including restaurant owners, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=233.11999999999998s)]
*  are struggling to find workers. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=235.28s)]
*  As the economy has rebounded, so have wages. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=237.2s)]
*  But participation in the labor force has flattened. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=240.72s)]
*  You know, some people moved out of dense cities [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=244.67999999999998s)]
*  that were seen as being unsafe because of the pandemic. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  And so as restaurants reopen, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=251.48s)]
*  it might be a geographic problem [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=253.39999999999998s)]
*  that there just might not be people in the place. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=254.92s)]
*  And then we also have to think about the policy effects. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=257.56s)]
*  So the government has thrown a lot of money [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=260.04s)]
*  at supporting workers who were affected by the pandemic. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  And some workers at this point might just be saying, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=266.12s)]
*  while they're still getting these unemployment benefits, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=268.6s)]
*  might be saying, you know what, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=271.16s)]
*  I don't have to rush back to work. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=272.64s)]
*  Fast food restaurants have started to offer perks [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=274.72s)]
*  like signing bonuses and free college tuition [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  in a bid to lower hourly workers. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=279.0s)]
*  All this adds up to pricier meals for diners. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=281.24s)]
*  I think most people would agree [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  that we want to see wages rising. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=287.56s)]
*  Particularly for lower-skill, low-income workers, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=290.44s)]
*  when wages are rising, that means they're better off. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=293.56s)]
*  That means they're bringing home bigger paychecks. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  What we don't want to see is wage increases [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=298.16s)]
*  paired together with inflation increases [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=300.48s)]
*  that start feeding on each other [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=303.04s)]
*  and leave workers actually worse off and not better off. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=305.32s)]
*  This effect, known as a wage price spiral, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=308.48s)]
*  contributed to the high inflation of the 1970s. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  But will history repeat itself? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=314.20000000000005s)]
*  The Federal Reserve, for its part, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=316.56s)]
*  has said prices will correct [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=318.36s)]
*  as supply and demand forces even out. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=319.76000000000005s)]
*  These one-time increases in prices [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=322.12s)]
*  are likely to have only transitory effects on inflation. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=324.16s)]
*  For now, indicators that measure expectations of inflation, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=328.04s)]
*  like treasury bond yields, remain low, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=331.56s)]
*  suggesting people expect inflation to be modest, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=334.24s)]
*  at least in the near term. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=336.92s)]
*  So for now, consumers will have to adjust [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  to some rising prices for their breakfast, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=341.04s)]
*  whether at home or at the diner. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=343.28s)]
*  Just don't forget to include the tip. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjjdaLwsBQ&t=345.35999999999996s)]
