# The Court That’s Sometimes Too Extreme for the Supreme Court | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng)
*  The Supreme Court has a lot of controversial cases on its docket. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=0.0s)]
*  Whether domestic abusers should have access to guns, whether the Consumer Financial Protection [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=4.08s)]
*  Bureau is constitutional, and if the abortion bill should be legal. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=8.4s)]
*  All of these cases come from one lower court. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=12.68s)]
*  The same one that also sent the court big cases about the Affordable Care Act and abortion. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  It's the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, arguably the most conservative appeals [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=21.44s)]
*  court in the country. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=26.04s)]
*  And strangely, even though they're bringing a conservative Supreme Court conservative [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=27.7s)]
*  cases, their most pressing rulings are being overturned. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=32.14s)]
*  A lot. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=35.46s)]
*  You have case after case where the Fifth Circuit had done something that was too far to the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=36.46s)]
*  right or too procedurally extreme, even for this Supreme Court. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=42.96s)]
*  That's Stephen Vladek, a professor and legal scholar. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=48.3s)]
*  The federal appeals courts are perhaps the most powerful institution that we spend the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=51.06s)]
*  least time talking about in our public discourse. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=55.3s)]
*  And he'll help us explain how the Fifth Circuit became the go-to place for controversial [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=58.22s)]
*  cases and why so many are making it to the Supreme Court. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=62.419999999999995s)]
*  There are 12 appeals courts representing different parts of the country, and their judges, just [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=67.82s)]
*  like Supreme Court justices, are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=72.34s)]
*  That used to involve getting 60 votes and the approval of the senators from the state [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=77.34s)]
*  they'd be representing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=81.5s)]
*  So there was some bipartisanship needed. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  You had really this long period of time where most, not all, but most of the federal judges [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=85.22s)]
*  being confirmed by the Senate were, you know, maybe a little right of center, a little left [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=91.62s)]
*  of center, but pretty centrist. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  Today, not so much. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=98.98s)]
*  For example, President Trump was able to appoint several judges to the Fifth Circuit who are [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=101.14s)]
*  different. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=105.14s)]
*  The judges are, I think, on anyone's placement pretty far to the right. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=106.3s)]
*  The Senate changed the rules, first in 2013, then more broadly in 2017, for judicial nominees [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=111.86s)]
*  to only need 50 votes for confirmation and removed the home state approval rule. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=117.42s)]
*  So Trump's nominees no longer needed bipartisan support. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=122.26s)]
*  You're seeing the sort of the norm for judicial confirmation be, you know, who is the most [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=125.94s)]
*  ideologically extreme person I can get through the Senate today. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=131.74s)]
*  For obvious reasons, that changes the calculus for what kind of person you're looking for. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=137.86s)]
*  So Trump nominated judges and justices who had extensive and controversial records. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=143.22000000000003s)]
*  Unlike previous appeals court judges who typically had backgrounds in private practice or as [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=149.06s)]
*  judges in other courts, most of Trump's judges, at least in the Fifth Circuit, also had political [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=153.66000000000003s)]
*  backgrounds, either working for campaigns, the White House, or directly for the governor [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=158.70000000000002s)]
*  and attorney general they now hear cases from. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=163.5s)]
*  I actually think that many of the judges that we're seeing nominated during the Trump administration [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=166.82s)]
*  and confirmed during the Trump administration, and indeed many of the judges we're seeing [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=172.14s)]
*  nominated during the Biden administration and confirmed today, would never have been [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=175.78s)]
*  nominated during prior presidencies of the same party. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=179.26s)]
*  And you know, I think folks will have different views about whether that's a good thing or [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=182.85999999999999s)]
*  a bad thing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=185.62s)]
*  What I think we can't deny is it's a thing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=187.12s)]
*  And it's having a pretty profound effect on the nature of the federal judiciary. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=189.98s)]
*  But the judges alone can explain the controversial cases. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=194.94s)]
*  They don't make them up. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=197.7s)]
*  Part of it is litigants steering cases to these judges. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=199.5s)]
*  The modus operandi is to file in Texas, where you can find a sympathetic district judge [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=203.94s)]
*  and where you know that any appeal is going to the Fifth Circuit. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=209.7s)]
*  The case against the abortion pill was filed in Amarillo, Texas. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=212.74s)]
*  Because the district judge there, the court that hears the cases before the appeals court [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=216.82s)]
*  does, is very conservative. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=220.22s)]
*  Dobbs was brought in Mississippi. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=222.58s)]
*  And the Fifth Circuit judges can even make the system work in their interest. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=225.46s)]
*  When a case comes to the Court of Appeals, it's assigned to a panel of three random [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=229.72000000000003s)]
*  judges. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=233.46s)]
*  At the Fifth Circuit, the odds are pretty good that a case will be heard by a majority [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=234.46s)]
*  of conservative judges. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=237.66000000000003s)]
*  But sometimes a case gets a majority of liberal judges. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=239.36s)]
*  Like with a case involving whether felons should have the right to vote in Mississippi. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=242.5s)]
*  The panel ruled they should. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=246.38000000000002s)]
*  But the full court can decide to rehear cases by the entire court, what's called en banc, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=248.02s)]
*  which it plans to do for that felon's one in January. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=253.58s)]
*  Folks tend to use the term judicial activism as a shorthand for decisions they disagree [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=257.02s)]
*  with. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=261.38s)]
*  And I think that in that respect, the term is unhelpful. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=262.38s)]
*  There is, however, I think something that is especially aggressive about the way the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=265.02s)]
*  Fifth Circuit's behaving, not just in the substance of the decisions that the court's [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=270.74s)]
*  But also just in its procedural behavior. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=277.34s)]
*  So one great example of this was the challenges to the Biden administration's vaccination [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=279.85999999999996s)]
*  or testing mandate for large employers. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=285.29999999999995s)]
*  Immediately, dozens of nearly identical lawsuits challenging the rule were filed in different [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=288.21999999999997s)]
*  states. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=292.34s)]
*  So many that every circuit court in the country would have heard the same case. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=293.34s)]
*  It triggered a literal lottery. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=297.14s)]
*  Each court with a pending case would have a ball put into a wooden drum and whoever [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=299.17999999999995s)]
*  had theirs picked out would hear the case. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=302.62s)]
*  But before that lottery happened, the Fifth Circuit cut ahead and ruled on the case anyway, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=304.82s)]
*  blocking the Biden administration's mandate. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=309.7s)]
*  After the lottery, the winning court reversed it and allowed the policy to go into effect. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=312.38s)]
*  It's not just that you have judges all the way to one side of the ideological spectrum [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=316.65999999999997s)]
*  who are being aggressive in adopting and pushing for new interpretations of what had been pretty [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=322.42s)]
*  settled legal concepts. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=330.64s)]
*  It's that they're taking procedural shortcuts. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=331.88s)]
*  And I think that's part of why we're seeing increasingly a disconnect between the conservative [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=335.16s)]
*  judges on the Fifth Circuit and the conservative justices on the Supreme Court, some of whom [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=340.88s)]
*  I think are much more particular about those procedural formalities. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=345.88s)]
*  President Trump was able to appoint a large number of polarizing judges. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=351.36s)]
*  President Biden has done some of the same thanks to that 50 vote rule. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=355.28s)]
*  But not as polarizing as the Democratic Senate has mostly taken the home state approval [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=358.68s)]
*  rule back up. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  I think the real problem at the end of the day is you might be happy with individual [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=364.6s)]
*  results in individual cases, but our legal system is not set up for a world in which [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=369.96s)]
*  you can have this kind of radical polls with no middle. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=376.04s)]
*  What that really is a recipe for is chaos and not a set of coherent, uniform legal principles [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=381.1s)]
*  that actually might allow us to function as one nation as opposed to 50 different states. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=389.12s)]
*  With the Fifth Circuit filled with conservative judges, it will continue to attract the most [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  conservative cases, some of which will inevitably end up at the Supreme Court. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKG9XiMQng&t=398.84s)]
