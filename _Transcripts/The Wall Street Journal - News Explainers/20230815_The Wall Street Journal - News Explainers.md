# Experts Break Down Trump’s Four Criminal Trials and Defense Strategy  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0)
*  Former President Donald Trump has been in court a lot lately. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=0.0s)]
*  Hush money payments. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=4.4s)]
*  Illegally possessed classified government materials. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  His attempt to overturn the results of an election. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=8.64s)]
*  We have seen nothing approaching this before with respect to these indictments of Donald Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=11.68s)]
*  Trump now faces four trials from two federal indictments and two state indictments. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=18.8s)]
*  Here's how Trump's legal team could mount their defense and how these charges could [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=24.72s)]
*  influence his 2024 bid and those of his rivals. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=28.72s)]
*  A Fulton County grand jury returned a true bill of indictment. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=33.6s)]
*  The Georgia indictment charges the former president with 13 felonies for trying to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=39.6s)]
*  undo his 2020 election defeat in the state. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=44.0s)]
*  The probe hinges on a key piece of evidence. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  A recorded phone call then President Trump made to Georgia's top elections official, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=49.76s)]
*  Brad Raffensperger. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more that we have. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=55.92s)]
*  Trump has said that he did nothing wrong and the call was quote, absolutely perfect. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=65.92s)]
*  I think that the strategy here, sort of the umbrella strategy, that it's a quote unquote [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=70.8s)]
*  witch hunt on multiple fronts to stop him from regaining the presidency. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  That's not really a legal defense. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=81.36s)]
*  That's more of a public relations defense. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=83.36s)]
*  But you know, he obviously has people who are buying into that theory. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=85.36s)]
*  One reason the Georgia indictment is different from the federal cases is that even if Trump [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=89.04s)]
*  were reelected as president. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=93.6s)]
*  Let's presume he's convicted in Georgia. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=95.36s)]
*  Federal government president has no pardon power over those state convictions. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=97.52s)]
*  In Georgia, the State Board of Pardons and Paroles doesn't consider pardon applications [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=104.0s)]
*  until five years after an individual has completed their sentence. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=108.72s)]
*  So he could be conceivably under the most outlandish scenario, sitting in prison and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=112.8s)]
*  still being the president of the United States. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=119.28s)]
*  Trump's alleged conduct in Georgia also plays a role in a federal case, accusing him [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=123.84s)]
*  of trying to subvert the will of American voters. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=128.72s)]
*  On August 1st, Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury in Washington. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=132.8s)]
*  The indictment, brought by special counsel Jack Smith, charges the former president with [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=137.44s)]
*  four criminal counts for his actions that culminated in the January 6th Capitol riot. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=142.08s)]
*  The January 6th case is clearly the most significant case. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=151.44s)]
*  It's the most comprehensive. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=154.96s)]
*  The attack on our nation's Capitol on January 6th, 2021, was an unprecedented assault on [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=156.72000000000003s)]
*  the seat of American democracy. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=164.08s)]
*  Trump has a right to challenge the election results. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=166.0s)]
*  Trump has a right to speak out, even lie, about the election results. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  Trump took his right and went to court and lost every single significant case. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=174.08s)]
*  That should have been the end of it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=179.12s)]
*  We fight like hell. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=183.44s)]
*  For the defense, they've already laid some seeds for their approach. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=186.96s)]
*  One is to delay the case as long as possible. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=191.44s)]
*  The second thing is to allege that he was merely exercising his First Amendment rights. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=193.68s)]
*  And I think, you know, as in most criminal defense cases, and I've been a criminal [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=198.32s)]
*  defense lawyer for a number of years myself, you try to distract the jury from the evidence [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=201.2s)]
*  by raising things like the First Amendment and other issues, which I think they'll do. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=205.44s)]
*  In a social media post, Trump said the case was a pathetic attempt by the Justice Department [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  to interfere with the 2024 presidential election. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=214.0s)]
*  When you look at what's happening, this is a persecution of a political opponent. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=217.44s)]
*  This was never supposed to happen in America. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  In June, Trump was indicted for his handling of classified documents, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=226.4s)]
*  marking the first time in history that the federal government has brought [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=230.4s)]
*  charges against a former president. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=233.68s)]
*  The case, also led by Jack Smith, alleges that Trump deliberately withheld sensitive [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, even after prosecutors requested their return last year. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=240.64s)]
*  This is really an obstruction of justice case. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=247.36s)]
*  This is not a possession of classified documents case. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=249.2s)]
*  Yes, you could have left office and accidentally or on purpose taken some documents that you [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=251.76s)]
*  shouldn't have, but once you know you're supposed to give them back, you can't then [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=256.56s)]
*  lie about it and hide them and engage in various schemes enlisting other people to help you do that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=260.48s)]
*  Trump has complained that he is being treated unfairly since classified documents have been [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  found in the possession of other high-ranking politicians. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=271.2s)]
*  They've tried to create a false equivalency between Trump's handling of documents and the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=274.48s)]
*  handling of documents by others. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=281.2s)]
*  Okay, well Mike Pence and Joe Biden had classified documents which they immediately returned [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  as soon as they were alerted. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=288.64s)]
*  Smith added new charges on July 27th, alleging that Trump and a maintenance worker [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=290.24s)]
*  sought to delete surveillance footage from Mar-a-Lago so it couldn't be turned over to a grand jury. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=295.2s)]
*  Trump has said he's an innocent man. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=301.28s)]
*  The April indictment of Donald Trump for allegedly falsifying business records [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=304.4s)]
*  marked the first time in U.S. history that a former president has faced criminal charges. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=308.8s)]
*  The Manhattan DA's case is a case that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the fact that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=314.08s)]
*  Trump was president of the United States. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  It has to do with the fact that he apparently paid hush money to a pornography actress [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=320.0s)]
*  and tried to conceal it, which you know at the end of the day, he's not the first person nor will [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  he be the last who does something like that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=329.2s)]
*  Trump has pleaded not guilty in the New York, Florida, and Washington, D.C. cases. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=331.52s)]
*  It remains to be seen how each trial will play out in court. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=336.48s)]
*  Trump's team, I think that their strategy has got to be to delay as long as possible. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=340.16s)]
*  The other strategy that they have is to try to try this case in the court of public opinion [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=346.16s)]
*  as opposed to in the courtroom where they can make these arguments that aren't really legal defenses [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=350.8s)]
*  like Trump believed that he actually won and I think that's going to be hard for them to [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=355.12s)]
*  convince a jury unanimously that that was the case here. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  Even if the defense doesn't convince the entire jury, a hung jury could still be considered a win for Trump. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=365.2s)]
*  All that Trump has to achieve in any of these cases is one juror who's voting against the other jurors. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=371.28s)]
*  So 11 to 1 for him would be a victory and then the prosecutor would have to decide do I want to retry this case. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=377.12s)]
*  While recent polls show Trump has a commanding lead over the rest of the Republican field, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=384.88s)]
*  his legal troubles have taken a chunk out of his campaign finances. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=389.68s)]
*  Recent data show that his main political committee, Save America, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=394.08s)]
*  shelled out more than 20 million dollars on legal related expenses so far this year. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=397.76s)]
*  But the indictments have also helped Trump fundraise. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=402.88s)]
*  In the days following the indictments, his campaign contributions increased by millions. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=406.24s)]
*  The critical thing will be the trials and whether he is convicted and the conventional wisdom is, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=411.84s)]
*  you know, this may help him, his base will unite behind him. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=418.56s)]
*  They've softened a bit. Yes, we still love Trump, but do we really want [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=422.88s)]
*  to go through all of this again or do we want to look forward? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=427.44s)]
*  Trump may also have to navigate attending various court dates while he's campaigning. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=433.04s)]
*  It's possible he could have four trials before the November election, each of which could take many weeks. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=437.6s)]
*  In other words, during the prime campaign season, he could be tied down in court. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=446.64s)]
*  And as for his political opponents on the 2024 campaign trail? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=452.96s)]
*  You know, if DeSantis and Nikki Haley and Tim Scott and others hope to bring down Trump, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  they have to go after him. Kind of what they've done so far, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=462.96s)]
*  tiptoeing around these incredibly serious charges against Donald Trump [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=465.84s)]
*  is going to do absolutely nothing for them. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRDtUIXfg0&t=470.96s)]
