Video Description: Bitcoin’s volatility has limited its adoption for payments, so entrepreneurs created stablecoins: cryptocurrencies pegged to assets such as the U.S. dollar. But the recent settlement of a probe into the most popular stablecoin, tether, shows the need for transparency in the growing industry. Photo illustration: Sharon Shi/WSJ

# Stablecoins: Why This Hot Cryptocurrency Faces Challenges | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw)
*  Bitcoin has become a popular mainstream investment, but it's also known for its volatility. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=0.0s)]
*  You don't know if in a week's time the value will be 20% lower, 10% lower, 10% higher. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=6.94s)]
*  Its value fluctuates so much that few people would use it to buy everyday goods such as [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=13.42s)]
*  shampoo or a plane ticket. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=18.12s)]
*  Some crypto entrepreneurs say there's one way to change that. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=20.22s)]
*  Stablecoins. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=23.56s)]
*  Dai, this is a really interesting one. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  USD coin or USDC. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=26.44s)]
*  Stablecoins are different from other cryptocurrencies and that they are pegged to assets like the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=28.92s)]
*  US dollar or gold, which is meant to make them more stable. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=33.08s)]
*  They've grown particularly popular among traders online. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=36.56s)]
*  In just a year, as Bitcoin hit new records, the market value of stablecoins has grown [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=40.36s)]
*  tenfold. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  Facebook has announced plans to launch its own stablecoin, and Visa said it would create [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  a stablecoin credit card. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=51.08s)]
*  But a probe of one stablecoin exposed some potential risks with this system. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=53.56s)]
*  It's Tether. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=58.88s)]
*  The New York attorney general had accused Tether, the most popular stablecoin, of lying [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  about the cash reserves it uses to guarantee its dollar peg. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=65.76s)]
*  Tether did not deny nor admit wrongdoing as part of a 2019 settlement, but agreed to release [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=69.68s)]
*  quarterly statements detailing its reserves. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=74.66s)]
*  So can stablecoins accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrencies in our daily lives, and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=78.4s)]
*  will they change the way we pay for goods? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=83.04s)]
*  According to its creators, Bitcoin was meant to allow direct payments without ever going [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=87.2s)]
*  through banks. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=91.72s)]
*  But so far, it's been accepted by few companies, with very few high-profile exceptions like [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=92.78s)]
*  Tesla. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=98.28s)]
*  Market analysts found that Bitcoin's price has at times jumped or crashed by as much [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=100.16s)]
*  as $6,000 in a day. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=104.08s)]
*  But that hasn't been the case for stablecoins. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=106.4s)]
*  In the past year, the value of top stablecoins has fluctuated by as much as four cents to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  their one dollar pegs. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=113.76s)]
*  You can have reasonable assurance that in three months' time or six months' time or [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=115.64s)]
*  one week's time, it'll still be worth $100. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=120.0s)]
*  And that's what was missing in crypto before stablecoins came along. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=123.48s)]
*  Alex Kern is an analyst who researches stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=126.84s)]
*  He says the first stablecoins were created as early as 2014. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=131.9s)]
*  The 24-hour trading volume is often over $90 billion. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=135.88s)]
*  Bitcoin is a little over $50 billion. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=139.32s)]
*  So it trades more often than Bitcoin. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=142.04s)]
*  Tether was pegged to the US dollar, and more than 200 other stablecoins followed. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=144.72s)]
*  Some pegged to the euro or to the Korean won, others to commodities like gold, silver or [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=150.0s)]
*  oil, or a combination of different assets. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=155.04s)]
*  On top of stability, stablecoins like Tether have another key advantage — speed. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=158.36s)]
*  Because this is digital money, transactions go through in a matter of seconds — faster [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=163.8s)]
*  than the three days it usually takes to wire US dollars or euros using traditional banks. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=168.0s)]
*  Stablecoins are also faster than Bitcoin because the payments are centralized and managed by [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=174.96s)]
*  the company that created them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=179.36s)]
*  For example, Tether transactions are managed by the Tether platform, while Bitcoin payments [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=181.36s)]
*  are processed by a vast, decentralized network of people called miners who are spread out [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=186.96s)]
*  all over the world. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=192.0s)]
*  It's instantaneous. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=193.56s)]
*  There's no settlement process that needs to occur. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=194.56s)]
*  Only a handful of e-commerce websites accept stablecoins at the moment. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=198.16s)]
*  But crypto traders have quickly adopted stablecoins like Tether to buy and sell cryptocurrencies [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=202.52s)]
*  online. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=207.72s)]
*  That's because stablecoins don't run on normal banking hours. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=208.72s)]
*  Compared to stocks that have to be traded in locations like New York or Hong Kong during [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=212.4s)]
*  specific hours, cryptocurrencies are traded 24 hours a day, seven days a week, all across [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=216.28s)]
*  the globe. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=222.22s)]
*  Plus, academics who study the role of cryptocurrencies say some banks have been wary to interact [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=223.76s)]
*  with crypto exchanges due to the lack of oversight in the industry and concerns that they could [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=228.88s)]
*  be exposed to illicit activities like laundering money or funding terrorism. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=233.28s)]
*  Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, said it is committed [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=237.64s)]
*  to creating a compliant, safe and reliable trading environment and it asks users to follow [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=242.72s)]
*  all local laws on money laundering and counterterrorism financing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=248.44s)]
*  In 2019, the New York Attorney General accused the companies managing the stablecoin Tether, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=253.88s)]
*  also called USDT, of making false statements to investors about the cash reserves of its [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=259.4s)]
*  currency, an essential component of what makes it stable and secure for investors. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=265.08s)]
*  The crypto community online discussed the probe and Tether's dollar backing. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=270.88s)]
*  If you go to their website right here, it says every Tether is always 100% backed by [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=274.8s)]
*  our reserves. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=279.76s)]
*  Which sounds very much as if one US dollar went in and a Tether was printed in return. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=281.0s)]
*  It's so simple. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=286.6s)]
*  The investigation found that in 2017 and 2018, Beatfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=287.6s)]
*  has common ownership with the company that controls Tether, relied on a third-party company [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=293.88s)]
*  named Crypto Capital Corporation to handle deposits and withdrawals on Beatfinex's [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=298.84s)]
*  trading platform. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=304.56s)]
*  The New York Attorney General's office said that Crypto Capital Corporation failed to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=306.12s)]
*  process some of these orders and Beatfinex lost access to $850 million of its customers' money. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=310.04s)]
*  Crypto Capital said it couldn't process Beatfinex transactions because in 2018, its [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=318.12s)]
*  bank accounts in the US, Poland, Portugal and the United Kingdom were frozen without [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=323.40000000000003s)]
*  justification. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=328.48s)]
*  Naturally, this significantly delayed fiat withdrawals from Beatfinex for its users, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=330.16s)]
*  which started to suspect something was up. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=334.68s)]
*  The New York Attorney General's office said Beatfinex tapped into Tether's dollar reserves [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=336.68s)]
*  to cover up the losses and afterwards lied to its customers when it said its currency [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=340.8s)]
*  was fully backed by US dollars at all times. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=346.0s)]
*  During the course of the New York Attorney General's investigation, Tether said it [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=350.32s)]
*  held 74% of the necessary reserves, which some investors consider to be enough to make [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  the digital currency secure. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=359.4s)]
*  This is perfectly common in modern banking in which only a fraction of bank deposits [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=361.4s)]
*  are backed by actual cash on hand. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=365.48s)]
*  As part of a settlement with the New York Attorney General's office, Beatfinex and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=368.76s)]
*  Tether Ltd. paid $18.5 million in penalties and stopped trading activity with New Yorkers. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=372.56s)]
*  This is finally coming to an end. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=379.32s)]
*  Beatfinex and Tether said the amount of money they agreed to pay should be viewed as a measure [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=382.24s)]
*  of their desire to put the matter behind them. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=386.44s)]
*  The firms did not admit or deny any wrongdoing. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=388.88s)]
*  History insiders say this investigation should be a warning to all companies that created [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=392.68s)]
*  stablecoins and to expect the stablecoin industry to be more tightly regulated in the coming [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=397.18s)]
*  years. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=402.48s)]
*  Some companies are already looking towards a future of using reliable virtual money as [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=404.28000000000003s)]
*  payments. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=408.6s)]
*  Visa announced a stablecoin-based credit card and said that making its digital currency [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=409.6s)]
*  strategy secure, private and trusted is a key priority. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=413.76s)]
*  Facebook's new cryptocurrency project, Diem, aims to create stablecoins pegged to different [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=417.56s)]
*  fiat currencies. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=422.36s)]
*  Diem says the system is being built with security in mind. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=423.72s)]
*  Some countries are also working on what financial analysts call the next iteration of stablecoins, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=427.72s)]
*  which will be a digital currency pegged to the national currency and controlled by central [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=433.16s)]
*  banks. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=437.2s)]
*  But before this type of digital money truly goes mainstream, Kern says its creators and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=438.2s)]
*  issuers are going to have to convince regulators and users that their technology will keep [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=444.04s)]
*  their money safe. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=448.72s)]
*  It's going to be very important for people to trust the entity that's issuing the stablecoin [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=450.04s)]
*  and the one that has the most trusted people over a period of time be the one that becomes [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=455.36s)]
*  the most heavily used. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEvxWQmloLw&t=459.92s)]
