# How the World’s Largest Shipyard Is Challenging China’s Dominance  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo)
*  This is Jeongjo the Great, a next-generation warship made in South Korea. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=0.0s)]
*  It's one of the most powerful of its kind, and it cost only $600 million to build. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=7.0s)]
*  A similar ship would cost almost a billion dollars more to construct in the US. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=12.0s)]
*  The cost of building a warship in the US has soared, while production times have slowed to a crawl [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=16.0s)]
*  after decades of deindustrialization left America with only a handful of shipyards. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=21.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, its strategic rival China has turned out hundreds of new ships, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=26.0s)]
*  now commanding the world's largest and fastest growing navy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=31.0s)]
*  Now the US is looking to Asia's shipyards to help close that gap [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=35.0s)]
*  as the two superpowers move closer to a potential conflict. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=38.0s)]
*  In the 1970s, the US shipbuilding industry had 13 public shipyards operating across the country, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=43.0s)]
*  building about 5% of the world's tonnage. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=49.0s)]
*  Today, only 4 yards are still in operation. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=52.0s)]
*  The navy is prevented from buying or constructing new ships abroad by a 1965 amendment to federal law. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=56.0s)]
*  And that has allowed China to set a course to one-day end US naval dominance. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=62.0s)]
*  Beijing is now the top global shipmaker by a wide margin. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=67.0s)]
*  Giant Chinese firms that crank out merchant ships for the world [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=71.0s)]
*  are often the same ones building warships for China's navy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=74.0s)]
*  Less than a decade ago, the US Navy held more battle-force ships compared to China. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=77.0s)]
*  Since then, China's fleet has rapidly overtaken the US Navy [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=82.0s)]
*  and is projected to have 435 military vessels by 2030, outsizing the US by over a third. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=86.0s)]
*  Officials are now in a race against time to stop that from happening. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=92.0s)]
*  While the navy can't buy ships from abroad, it can import expertise. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=96.0s)]
*  And if there is one place that can rival China's shipbuilding prowess, it's South Korea. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=100.0s)]
*  The country is a leader in shipbuilding specializing in high-end military vessels and large commercial ships. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=104.0s)]
*  Much of that work takes place here, at the largest shipyard in the world, operated by Hyundai Heavy Industries. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=110.0s)]
*  Each year, dozens of military and commercial ships are built here. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=116.0s)]
*  And the US Navy sees this as one answer to a vexing problem, how to catch up with China. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=120.0s)]
*  Zhengzhou the Great is the first of several new destroyers Hyundai is building. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=125.0s)]
*  The US is prohibited from buying these vessels directly, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=129.0s)]
*  but naval officials want to replicate how Hyundai makes them at a fraction of the cost. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=131.0s)]
*  The ship measures more than 550 feet and can carry up to 300 crew. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=136.0s)]
*  It's fitted with a weapon system that has a detection range of about 500 miles and can track over a thousand targets at once. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=141.0s)]
*  The ship has a vertical launch system capable of firing missiles at targets in the air or on land. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=149.0s)]
*  Expanded sonar capabilities allow the vessel to detect submarines at a range far greater than older destroyers. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=155.0s)]
*  We have a hexagon radar out there. That radar is very powerful. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=159.0s)]
*  So once North Korea launches the missile, that radar can detect in less than a second. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=164.0s)]
*  America has a fleet of ships just like this, but what makes this one different being built here in Korea? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=170.0s)]
*  We can build a ship in a very cost-effective way. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=176.0s)]
*  We have a very healthy and reliable marine industry around us. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=180.0s)]
*  We can control the cost and we are adapting the cost of the ship. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=184.0s)]
*  We are developing very good shipbuilding technology from our main shipyard. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=189.0s)]
*  Hyundai's military ships are built in the same yard as the company's commercial vessels, where about 40 to 50 hulls are built each year. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=194.0s)]
*  It means the company can build a destroyer in just 18 months, significantly faster than the 28 months it would take in the U.S. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=201.0s)]
*  We are sharing all the shipbuilding technology from the commercial shipbuilding. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=208.0s)]
*  We share all the new technology for improving the productivity for the shipbuilding. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=212.0s)]
*  So that also makes us very efficient. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=217.0s)]
*  That efficiency is what U.S. naval officials are hoping to replicate. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=221.0s)]
*  Secretary of the U.S. Navy, Carlos del Toro, traveled to Asia as part of a pitch to shipbuilders to help revive American shipyards. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=225.0s)]
*  We shut down many shipyards in this country thinking that we would not need them. We became less competitive. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=233.0s)]
*  Because of that, our building of our naval capabilities, of our naval ships, have become far more expensive [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=238.0s)]
*  because there are far fewer shipyards that actually build our navy ships. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=244.0s)]
*  Once those vessels are built, analysts say that in a prolonged conflict, maintaining the fleet near the battle space is key. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=249.0s)]
*  Hyundai Heavy Industries recently signed an agreement to allow U.S. naval hulls to be repaired in South Korea. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=257.0s)]
*  This will allow U.S. vessels in need of repair to stay in Asia instead of making the lengthy journey back to American shipyards. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=264.0s)]
*  You are looking at the Chinese having greater availability of ships. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=271.0s)]
*  There's also a geographical advantage that China faces of where they should maintain, repair, and overhaul the ships. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=276.0s)]
*  You don't want to have a battle out there in the Philippine Sea and then you have to retire all the way to Guam or even all the way to stateside. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=282.0s)]
*  Then you will leave a gap where you have no ships or too few ships to make any difference in the theater. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=289.0s)]
*  Hyundai Heavy Industries will soon help start training shipbuilding engineers in the U.S. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=296.0s)]
*  but these measures may not meet the need to revive the U.S. Navy and South Korea's prowess can't easily be replicated. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=301.0s)]
*  We need engineering, procurement, construction, and integration. So all has to be aligned and well balanced. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=307.0s)]
*  So we cannot build a ship, just engineering is powerful. All has to harmonize together. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=315.0s)]
*  America's efforts to revitalize its shipbuilding capacity has taken on a new urgency as tensions rise over Taiwan. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=322.0s)]
*  Beijing claims the self-ruled island as part of its territory and is threatened to take control by force if necessary. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=329.0s)]
*  America's naval superiority is a deterrent to a Chinese invasion as long as it can be maintained. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=336.0s)]
*  Assuming that there is not just a Taiwan conflict but assuming there is also conflict elsewhere. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=342.0s)]
*  The ongoing availability issues for the U.S. Navy to concentrate enough forces in the theater while having to take care of other regions, it will be a huge stretch. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=346.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean the U.S. will not win a conflict over Taiwan but then the question is at what cost? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=357.0s)]
*  While the U.S. Navy is technologically superior to its Chinese rival, naval strategists argue that fleet size also matters. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=364.0s)]
*  The bigger the better. The clock is ticking for the U.S. to increase its number of warships. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=371.0s)]
*  But the laws designed to protect America's shipbuilders have backed the Navy into a corner. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=376.0s)]
*  The U.S. will need to look beyond its shores if it is to avoid falling irreversibly behind in a new era of great power competition. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJkyurhnAQo&t=381.0s)]
