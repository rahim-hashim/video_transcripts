# Elon Musk’s $46B Pay Package Four Ways the Vote Could Unfold  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw)
*  Will Elon Musk's 2018 pay package be approved for a second time? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the $46 billion question at the upcoming Tesla shareholder meeting. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=5.28s)]
*  Tesla is now going to be going to shareholders asking them to vote again on Elon Musk's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=9.92s)]
*  multi-billion dollar pay package. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=14.56s)]
*  The ratification of the pay package is really about fairness. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=16.32s)]
*  We would not be voting in favor of that proposal. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=19.6s)]
*  After a judge shot down the initial pay deal, Tesla's board is hoping a second vote will [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=22.56s)]
*  help secure Musk's compensation and keep the CEO, who also owns X and runs SpaceX and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=27.68s)]
*  XAI, focused on Tesla. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=34.4s)]
*  Sometimes the work pain level is quite excruciating. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=36.8s)]
*  Here are the four ways the shareholder vote could go and how the outcome could affect Tesla. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=41.2s)]
*  Two hurdles currently stand between Musk and the compensation package, shareholders and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=49.2s)]
*  a Delaware judge. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=54.08s)]
*  In January, the judge, Chancellor Kathleen McCormick, struck down the initial pay deal, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=56.32s)]
*  calling the approval process deeply flawed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=61.52s)]
*  She said Musk held some of the most influential corporate positions, enjoyed thick ties with [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=65.2s)]
*  the directors tasked with negotiating on behalf of Tesla, and dominated the process that led [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=69.84s)]
*  to board approval of his compensation plan. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=74.8s)]
*  Instead of waiting for McCormick to issue her final judgment and then appealing, Tesla's [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=77.6s)]
*  board decided to hold a second vote on the pay package. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=82.16s)]
*  It's just unprecedented. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=85.44s)]
*  I have never heard of a situation where after a court concluded that there had been a breach [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  of fiduciary duty and ordered some kind of remedy, there was an attempt to undo that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=92.88s)]
*  with a new shareholder vote but no substantive changes to the original conduct. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=98.32s)]
*  It's just, it hasn't been done. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=102.64s)]
*  Legally, there are four ways the vote could play out. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=106.24s)]
*  If shareholders decide against the package, court proceedings move forward as though the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=109.2s)]
*  vote never happened. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=113.52s)]
*  If they vote for the pay deal, Chancellor McCormick can accept that result. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=114.72s)]
*  She says, okay, you got me. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=119.28s)]
*  That's it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=120.72s)]
*  I guess I'll give it all back and we're done. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=121.36s)]
*  Musk is probably very happy he doesn't want to appeal, but the plaintiff appeals to the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=123.52s)]
*  Delaware Supreme Court. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  The other extreme is that she looks at it and she says, this is ridiculous. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=128.32s)]
*  You can't undo a trial finding this way. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=132.16s)]
*  And then that all gets appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=133.92s)]
*  The third possibility is she says, I don't have enough information to be able to determine [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  if this fixed it all. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=141.68s)]
*  In which case, maybe there has to be document production discovery. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=142.72s)]
*  Maybe there has to be depositions. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=146.88s)]
*  Maybe there has to be a whole new hearing. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=149.2s)]
*  Whatever the shareholders say and whatever Chancellor McCormick decides, the second vote [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=151.36s)]
*  could still play a role in any appeal. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=155.68s)]
*  Either way, it's color. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=157.92s)]
*  And you have to wonder, especially when this gets to the Delaware Supreme Court, which [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=159.92s)]
*  it absolutely will, whether the Delaware Supreme Court, when it evaluates what happened in [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=163.68s)]
*  2018, whether in the back of their minds is, well, there was this new vote, even if it's [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=168.16s)]
*  not technically relevant. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=173.68s)]
*  Back in 2018, Tesla was valued at around $53 billion, less than one-tenth of where it stands [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=176.4s)]
*  today. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=183.28s)]
*  And Musk was struggling with production issues. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=183.84s)]
*  At times, he was sleeping on the factory floor. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=186.56s)]
*  When this deal was proposed, the future of Tesla was really a big question mark. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=189.28s)]
*  We're not perfect, but we pour our heart and soul into the product and we really care. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=195.12s)]
*  Tesla was struggling. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=202.24s)]
*  It had posted its seventh consecutive quarterly loss in the second quarter of 2018. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=203.68s)]
*  And by August of that year, the company barely had enough cash on hand to function. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=208.96s)]
*  The size of the pay package was unheard of. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=214.32s)]
*  And Musk was going to have to earn it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  His compensation was tied to Tesla's performance. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=218.96s)]
*  In a recent video addressing shareholders, the board chair laid out the strategy. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=222.32000000000002s)]
*  If he failed, Elon was entitled to receive no salary, no cash bonuses, and no equity. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  The award worked. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=235.12s)]
*  Elon Musk wants to get paid. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=236.8s)]
*  He argues that he had a deal. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=238.56s)]
*  He had a deal in 2018 to meet incredibly ambitious targets for the company, to get the market [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=240.56s)]
*  valuation to huge levels that didn't seem possible to a lot of outsiders. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=247.52s)]
*  And he achieved those things. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=252.88000000000002s)]
*  The Tesla board is hoping shareholders will support Musk's pay package in Thursday's vote. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=254.88000000000002s)]
*  But it's not a sure thing. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  For some investors, this is a referendum on Elon Musk. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=261.68s)]
*  There has been criticism that he has been distracted, been distracted by Twitter, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=265.6s)]
*  now known as X, been distracted with XAI, this startup that he created for artificial intelligence, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=270.56s)]
*  that to some looks like a competitor to Tesla. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=276.72s)]
*  A referendum on is he engaged enough? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=280.56s)]
*  Some feel that he's distracted and they're not getting the best of him. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  On top of that, Musk has said he wants a greater stake in the company. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=288.64000000000004s)]
*  Currently, he directly holds about 13%. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  In January, he posted on X, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI and robotics without having [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=298.0s)]
*  around 25% voting control. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=302.8s)]
*  Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can't be overturned. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=305.68s)]
*  Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=309.12s)]
*  That's a problem for some Tesla investors who have thought of the company as an AI company, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=313.44s)]
*  that its future is not just making cars, but cars that can drive themselves and also humanoid robots. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=318.8s)]
*  This big vision for the future has been taking that stock to record heights in past years. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  So the big existential question is what is Tesla going forward? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=330.24s)]
*  And the idea that Elon Musk might not be there really rattles a lot of investors. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=334.08s)]
*  Musk has been retweeting supporters and sharing voting instructions on X. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=339.84s)]
*  But with the legal battle still looming, the shareholder vote will likely be just one element, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=344.4s)]
*  and not the deciding factor in Musk's future at Tesla. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  The hope among Tesla's board is that if investors approve this pay package, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=352.4s)]
*  it will remove this cloud hanging over the company. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=357.52s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is, there will still be some uncertainty. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=360.8s)]
*  There is still a court case going on. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=364.24s)]
*  There are still legal questions that are plaguing the company regarding this pay package, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  and it is not decided yet. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--cU7IU1dHw&t=372.88s)]
