# Biden’s High-Stakes NATO News Conference, Analyzed | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ)
*  The President of the United States, Joe Biden. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you. Please be seated. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=7.44s)]
*  President Biden, in a closely watched press conference on Thursday, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=9.44s)]
*  calmed down some of the most nervous Democrats, but it remains to be seen if he's done enough [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  to save his candidacy. President Biden's performance at the press conference was pretty [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=18.72s)]
*  consistent with what people who watch the president closely would see. He had the same kind of strong [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=22.88s)]
*  moments and weak moments that he has had at multiple press conferences over the last few months. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=29.44s)]
*  What has changed is the scrutiny on him is much, much more intense. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=35.52s)]
*  I'm not in this for my legacy. I'm in this to complete the job I started. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=39.68s)]
*  The stakes for this were extremely high for the president. He has been, since the debate, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=45.2s)]
*  on this sort of cleanup tour trying to do a number of things to show that he has the mental acuity [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=49.6s)]
*  to continue to run the country. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=55.28s)]
*  I beat him once and I will beat him again. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=56.64s)]
*  He had some flubs early on. He mixed up Vice President Trump when he meant to say Vice President Harris. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=59.68000000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=67.44s)]
*  though I think she was not qualified to be president. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=71.04s)]
*  The press conference showed him the way he is. You know, he's an 81-year-old man and, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=73.28s)]
*  you know, he does have really good moments and he has a deep knowledge of foreign policy, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=77.76s)]
*  which was very clearly on display. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=82.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of things in retrospect I wish I had been able to convince the Israelis to do, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=83.84s)]
*  but the bottom line is we have a chance now. It's time to end this war. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  Doesn't mean walk away from going after Sinwar and Hamas. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  There are questions about whether or not he would be able to physically do this job [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=99.84s)]
*  in two or three years. Already he has said, I'm not as good of a debater that I used to be. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=105.44s)]
*  I want to shift my schedule so that I'm doing fewer things later at night. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=113.04s)]
*  Instead of my every day starting at seven and going to bed at midnight, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=118.48s)]
*  it'd be smarter for me to pace myself a little more. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  He was a little reflective, I think, and I think that is something that there has been a desire [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  for among Democrats that I've talked to at least. He was asked at the very end what it would take [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=131.52s)]
*  for him to leave the race. If your team came back and showed you data that she would fair better [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=136.24s)]
*  against former President Donald Trump, would you reconsider your decision to stay in the race? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=142.08s)]
*  No, unless they came back and said, there's no way you can win. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=148.0s)]
*  Me. No one's saying that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=153.84s)]
*  The Democratic Party going into this press conference is in complete disarray. There have [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=157.12s)]
*  been about a dozen lawmakers at this point, elected members of Congress who are Democrats [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=162.8s)]
*  who have called on President Biden to drop out of the presidential race. Talking to donors [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=169.52s)]
*  who were texting me during the press conference is that there's this fear that they have when [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=174.72s)]
*  they're watching him that, you know, oh my gosh, is it going to be OK? Are we going to see the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  debate version of Joe Biden again? Or is he going to get through it? And there's this [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=187.36s)]
*  heightened anxiety every time he is talking. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=192.56s)]
*  And so our military is where I'm following the advice of my commander in chief, my, my, my, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=196.0s)]
*  the chief of staff of the military, as well as the secretary of defense and our intelligence people. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=203.36s)]
*  And that's also playing into the sense of, I don't know, four months is really a lifetime [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=209.12s)]
*  in politics. Can we really ride this horse all the way to November? There's a kind of anticipation [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=213.52s)]
*  and anxiety in the White House about whether there's going to be an onslaught of additional [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=221.84s)]
*  Democratic leaders who are going to call on the president to drop out. And if you think of it as [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  a sort of a dam that's about to break, it is leaking. It is a leaky dam. It is a sort of about [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=232.88s)]
*  to break. There is, you know, one theory by people who are close to Biden's advisors, which is that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=238.96s)]
*  the president really has up to this weekend to make a final, final decision. And the thing that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=246.72s)]
*  is going to change, and this is the mind of many of the Biden people and the people close to the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=251.84s)]
*  Biden's, is that the Republican convention starts on Monday. And for them, they believe that the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=256.16s)]
*  sort of glare of the media is going to shift away from Joe Biden and onto Donald Trump. And that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=263.12s)]
*  is really where they want the attention to be. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FTajHP4JoQ&t=268.96s)]
