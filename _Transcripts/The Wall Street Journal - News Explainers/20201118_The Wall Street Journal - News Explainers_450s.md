# Section 230: The Law at the Center of the Big Tech Debate | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 18, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU)
*  Leaders in government and tech want to rewrite a law that shapes the Internet. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=0.0s)]
*  It is clear that Section 230 in its current form is no longer working. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=5.0s)]
*  This law needs to be updated so that it continues to work well. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=10.0s)]
*  I think that Congress should update the law to make sure that it's working as intended. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=15.0s)]
*  Section 230 is a law that governs who's liable for what people post on social media. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=21.0s)]
*  But some critics say it lets platforms censor users or spread harmful information and should be rewritten. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=26.0s)]
*  Most everyone agrees that it's time to review Section 230, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=33.0s)]
*  but there's not a lot of consensus about what the problems are with it or what to do about it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=38.0s)]
*  To understand this debate, it will help to dissect the bill. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=44.0s)]
*  Here's the first critical passage. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=48.0s)]
*  No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=50.0s)]
*  This gives websites the first of two key protections. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=61.0s)]
*  One is immunity when one of their users posts something that might be offensive or harmful. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=65.0s)]
*  In that case, the user is the one liable for the speech, not the Internet company that hosted it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=71.0s)]
*  In other words, Twitter isn't liable for what people tweet. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=77.0s)]
*  That's different from traditional media companies who can be sued over what they publish. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=81.0s)]
*  The other key protection that Section 230 gives Internet companies is the freedom to moderate the content that users upload. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=85.0s)]
*  The freedom to moderate comes from this passage. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=93.0s)]
*  Companies that operate in good faith have the power to restrict access to material that they consider to be objectionable, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=96.0s)]
*  whether or not such material is constitutionally protected. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=103.0s)]
*  So if they take down a post that's offensive or harmful, they won't be held liable for that either. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=106.0s)]
*  It was written when the Internet was really growing up, and there were a lot of websites out there, there were a lot of startups, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=113.0s)]
*  and it was kind of a free-for-all in terms of what the rules of the road were around who could say what and who would be liable if something bad happened related to Internet content. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=119.0s)]
*  In the 90s, Internet service providers like Prodigy were developing interactive features for their platforms, like bulletin boards. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=130.0s)]
*  But on one of these bulletin boards, a Prodigy user wrote a post that led to a lawsuit from an infamous brokerage firm called Stratton Oakmont. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=137.0s)]
*  You may remember it from the Wolf of Wall Street movie where it was portrayed. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=146.0s)]
*  They got involved in the Section 230 story because they sued someone who had posted something about them online. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=150.0s)]
*  Stratton wanted its defamation suit, in part because Prodigy had moderated its content, which, in the court's view, made it a publisher. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=158.0s)]
*  So the Stratton case created this dynamic where Internet companies had kind of a perverse incentive. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=166.0s)]
*  If they took down a piece of content because it was harmful, they could be sued for doing that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=171.0s)]
*  And so in a way, they had an incentive not to do anything, to just let people say whatever they wanted, or they could just not allow any posts by users at all. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=177.0s)]
*  And neither of those outcomes seemed very beneficial to consumers. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=187.0s)]
*  And that's why Congress stepped in. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=192.0s)]
*  Senator Ron Wyden co-authored the 1996 text and has said that Section 230 was written to relieve the burden on fledgling tech companies. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=194.0s)]
*  We wanted small businesses to start out focusing on hiring engineers, developers and designers, rather than worrying about how they had to hire a team of lawyers. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=203.0s)]
*  But since Section 230 was written, the reach and political importance of platforms has grown, and that's led to numerous calls to update the law. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=216.0s)]
*  Republicans have challenged the legal protections that Section 230 grants and say that the law lets tech companies censor conservatives. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=224.0s)]
*  Here's Senator Roger Wicker commenting on a range of content takedowns that occurred ahead of the 2020 election. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=231.0s)]
*  These recent incidents are only the latest in a long trail of censorship and suppression of conservative voices on the Internet. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=238.0s)]
*  Reasonable observers are left to wonder whether big tech firms are obstructing the flow of information to benefit one political ideology or agenda. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=246.0s)]
*  But platforms debate these claims. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=257.0s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=259.0s)]
*  We approach our work without political bias, full stop. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=260.0s)]
*  To do otherwise would be contrary to both our business interests and our mission. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=264.0s)]
*  If Republicans are concerned that Internet companies are taking too many posts down, Democrats have the opposite concern. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=269.0s)]
*  They're worried that Internet companies are leaving too many posts up, in particular false information about elections or any other issue. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=277.0s)]
*  So they really want to see these companies be a lot more active. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=286.0s)]
*  Facebook is profiting off and amplifying disinformation that harms others because it's profitable. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=290.0s)]
*  This isn't a speech issue. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=298.0s)]
*  On the campaign trail, Joe Biden said that it's time to revoke how much protection tech platforms get. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=300.0s)]
*  I, for one, think we should be considering taking away the exemption that they cannot be sued for knowingly engaged on in promoting something that's not true. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=306.0s)]
*  Others like Susan Ness, a former FCC commissioner, say that limiting the liability protections in Section 230 could chill free expression. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=319.0s)]
*  To the extent one plays around with it too much or removes it, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=327.0s)]
*  it will have a dramatic and negative impact on freedom of expression. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=332.0s)]
*  Others question the assumption that tech companies are acting in good faith, especially when harmful content goes viral. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=338.0s)]
*  Some lawmakers look at this issue and say, look, if an Internet company takes a piece of content and processes it, puts it through an algorithm, promotes it and helps it go viral, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=344.0s)]
*  well, in that case, maybe the company should have more responsibility about whether that content was harmful. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=356.0s)]
*  Others simply think the companies have too much leeway to decide what stays up and what comes down. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=362.0s)]
*  One bill from Senate Republicans aims to strike the otherwise objectionable standard and replace it with narrower guidance on content that promotes self-harm, terrorism or unlawful activity. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=368.0s)]
*  Another area of focus is transparency. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=379.0s)]
*  There is real mistrust among the American people about whether you're being fair or transparent. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=382.0s)]
*  This is one area where tech executives say they agree. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=388.0s)]
*  I hear the concerns and acknowledge them, but we want to fix it with more transparency. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=391.0s)]
*  You know, these companies really have come to a point where they've been under criticism for years and they're realizing that saying, hey, just keep your hands off us isn't going to work. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=397.0s)]
*  And so they are now advocating for some form of regulation that they can live with. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=407.0s)]
*  All these solutions we're talking about are legislative and it's hard to pass laws, particularly when Congress is divided. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=412.0s)]
*  And that means the courts could be the first place where Section 230 changes. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=419.0s)]
*  Justice Clarence Thomas issued a statement where he questioned whether the provision has been interpreted too broadly by the courts. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=425.0s)]
*  And he was sort of inviting legal challenges to Section 230 and the way that it's been interpreted. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=433.0s)]
*  With a review of Section 230 underway, the web that we know could morph into something fundamentally different. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTc6s5YTbU&t=439.0s)]
