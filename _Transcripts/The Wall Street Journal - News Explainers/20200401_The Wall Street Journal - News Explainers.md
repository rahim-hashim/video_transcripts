# Why the Coronavirus Stimulus Is Limiting Stock Buybacks  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 01, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY)
*  On March 27th, President Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion stimulus plan aimed at combating [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=0.0s)]
*  the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=8.08s)]
*  But the bailout comes with strings attached. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  A ban on share buybacks and dividends for any company receiving a government loan from [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=13.86s)]
*  the stimulus package. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=17.76s)]
*  The ban will last the term of the government assistance plus one year. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=19.84s)]
*  This clause was added after critics argued that companies like Boeing and airlines have [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=23.78s)]
*  spent too much money buying back their own shares from the stock market. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=28.8s)]
*  Money they could have been saving for a rainy day. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=32.94s)]
*  We'll explain, but first you have to understand how buybacks work. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  In 2017, Trump's tax overhaul left companies flush with cash. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=41.16s)]
*  Over the following two years, companies on the S&P 500 bought back an estimated $1.5 [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  trillion of their own shares from investors. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=51.68s)]
*  The purpose of the tax cut was not directly to encourage stock buybacks. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=54.6s)]
*  The purpose of the tax cut was to encourage companies to bring money home and put it to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=58.32s)]
*  more productive use in the United States economy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=61.8s)]
*  In common share buybacks, the company buys back shares on the open market, leaving fewer [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=66.32s)]
*  shares outstanding. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=71.18s)]
*  This boosts a metric called earnings per share, or EPS. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=74.1s)]
*  EPS is calculated by taking the company's net income and dividing it by the number of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=77.56s)]
*  outstanding shares. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=83.0s)]
*  When the divisor shrinks, the EPS goes up. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=84.78s)]
*  Higher earnings per share makes the stock look more attractive to investors, which can [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=88.42s)]
*  push up the share price. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=92.14s)]
*  There's a raging debate about the benefits of buybacks and how they work, but I think [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=94.06s)]
*  the people who support them would say first of all that they do benefit shareholders, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=98.26s)]
*  and shareholders don't have to be rich people or hedge fund owners. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=102.42s)]
*  They can be pension funds who pay money to wide ranges of people, including a lot of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=106.06s)]
*  organized labor. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=110.3s)]
*  They also, according to the advocates, benefit the economy as a whole. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=111.38s)]
*  Critics of buybacks say it's part of a whole distorted incentive system for corporate America. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=115.69999999999999s)]
*  They say that a lot of it is related to the fact that corporate executives now themselves [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=120.02s)]
*  get paid with stock. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=123.97999999999999s)]
*  The reason that that has evolved over time was to try and more closely align the incentives [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=125.38s)]
*  of CEOs with shareholders. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=130.46s)]
*  But it also, in the minds of buyback critics, has created a perverse incentives where it's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  also given CEOs an elevated incentive to worry more about the share price than about [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=137.06s)]
*  long-term investments or investing in their workers. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=141.86s)]
*  Buyback activists saw the stimulus package as an opportunity to implement limitations. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=146.26s)]
*  The stimulus sets aside at least $50 billion for cargo and passenger airlines and $17 billion [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=150.86s)]
*  for businesses deemed critical to national security, such as Boeing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=156.82s)]
*  This comes after the coronavirus pandemic caused a severe dip in ridership, sending [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=161.18s)]
*  shares into freefall. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=165.7s)]
*  Critics point out that over the past 10 years, the biggest U.S. airlines have spent 96 percent [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=168.5s)]
*  of their free cash flow on buying back their own shares. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=173.57999999999998s)]
*  American Airlines said it's put considerably more money into capital investments and its [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=177.94s)]
*  team than buybacks in recent years. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=182.22s)]
*  The aircraft manufacturer, Boeing, is also expected to receive aid from the stimulus [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=185.06s)]
*  package. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=189.26s)]
*  So the criticism about buybacks and corporate behavior are aimed at airlines and Boeing [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=190.38s)]
*  and some sectors looking for federal money, specifically because they are looking for [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=195.78s)]
*  federal money. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=199.62s)]
*  The argument is that if you are asking taxpayers for funds, that first of all, we need to tie [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=200.62s)]
*  up some strings so you're not abusing that money. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  A lot of that is sort of a hangover from the 2008 bailouts, whether it was a feeling of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=208.7s)]
*  banks got taxpayer funds, then they used it to pay big bonuses to their executives. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=212.66s)]
*  As buybacks have increased in recent years, they've become a contentious issue in Washington. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=217.1s)]
*  Democrats have long favored restrictions on buybacks before this latest crisis, and they [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=223.26s)]
*  see this crisis in a way as an opportunity to begin to impose new government restrictions [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=227.78s)]
*  on them. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=232.85999999999999s)]
*  Republicans in general have taken the opposite point of view, feeling like it's illegitimate [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=234.29999999999998s)]
*  for the government to weigh in, imposing new limits on how companies spend their money. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=238.22s)]
*  And Trump, surprisingly in recent days, has taken a sense of the Democratic view and has [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=242.98s)]
*  echoed their views that buybacks are not a legitimate way of using corporate money at [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=248.06s)]
*  a time of crisis. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=253.62s)]
*  Over $500 billion in support for the hardest hit industries with a ban on corporate stock [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=254.94s)]
*  buybacks, which is something I insisted on. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=261.78s)]
*  The inclusion of an anti-buybacks clause in the stimulus package is a big win for those [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=264.74s)]
*  who oppose buybacks. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=268.98s)]
*  But even with the stimulus in place, the U.S. economy is still shaky. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=271.22s)]
*  Because of this, most companies are staying focused on liquidity rather than buybacks. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=275.54s)]
*  This is really a true crisis where companies are not as much worried about propping up [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=281.02000000000004s)]
*  their own shares as just preparing for their survival. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=285.62s)]
*  In fact, at this moment, a lot of companies are canceling share repurchase plans, canceling [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=287.94000000000005s)]
*  dividends, trying to keep as much cash on hand as they can in order to make it through [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  the next few difficult weeks and months. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIO44phvHY&t=296.42s)]
