Video Description: China has been the most populous country for more than two centuries – until this month. India's population may have surpassed China’s, a milestone that some believe heralds a new global order.

# What India’s Population Surpassing China’s Means for Global Economies | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4)
*  You are looking at the demographic breakdown of China and India's populations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=0.0s)]
*  In 1990, both countries' demographics resembled a pyramid, which meant that there were far [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=6.32s)]
*  more young people being born than there were old people. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=11.16s)]
*  But fast forward to projections for 2050, and you'll notice a dramatic change. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  The Chinese pyramid narrows to resemble a shape more like a funnel. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=19.6s)]
*  For more than two centuries, China has had the largest population in the world. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=24.8s)]
*  This year, the UN said India will take its place. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=29.6s)]
*  India's population is expected to keep growing for the next four decades, peaking at nearly [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  1.7 billion in 2063. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=38.44s)]
*  China's population is projected to shrink rapidly. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=41.68s)]
*  By the start of the next century, India's population is expected to be double that of [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=44.72s)]
*  China's. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=49.28s)]
*  All the signs point to a very challenging future for China demographically. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=50.28s)]
*  Here's why this shift marks a watershed moment for both nations and what the change could [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  mean for the global economy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  This year, China announced its first population decline since 1961. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=65.74s)]
*  In 2020, China's fertility rate, or the number of children a woman has over her lifetime, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=70.84s)]
*  came in at 1.3, which is one of the lowest in the world. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=76.8s)]
*  The roots of China's demographic crisis can be found in its one-child policy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  The policy was designed to keep birth low so that China would have the opportunity to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=85.48s)]
*  grow its economy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=92.44s)]
*  It turns out in reality, the one-child policy has far more long-lasting impacts than policymakers [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  intended. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=102.72s)]
*  In a way, it worked too well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=103.72s)]
*  Starting in 1980, most Chinese couples were strictly limited to one child. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  Despite reversing the one-child policy in 2016, China's fertility rate has continued [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=110.96s)]
*  to decline. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  Meaning that a woman would need to give birth to at least two children to keep the population [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  stable and essentially replace the parents. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=127.72s)]
*  With a fertility rate of 2.0, India's fertility rate is slightly lower than the replacement rate. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=130.72s)]
*  In China, the one-child policy produced a dramatic gender imbalance that originated [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=140.96s)]
*  in strong cultural and social preferences for male children. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=155.84s)]
*  In 2021, the number of marriage registrations plummeted to 7.6 million, the lowest since [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=159.88s)]
*  the government started keeping records in the mid-1980s. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=165.74s)]
*  The global economy has grown to rely on China's vast pool of factory workers for manufactured [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=169.6s)]
*  goods. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=174.76s)]
*  And, its consumers represent a growing market for Western-made cars and luxury goods. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=175.76s)]
*  In the coming decades, demographers expect China will face a huge worker-to-retiree gap. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=198.12s)]
*  In 2020, 14% of China's population was over 64 years old, while in India, just 7% of people [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=203.84s)]
*  were over 64. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=211.52s)]
*  By 2070, nearly 59% of people in China will be over the age of 64, while in India, only [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=213.04s)]
*  30% of the population will be in the same age bracket. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  In some ways, India looks like China did 30 years ago. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=228.12s)]
*  It has a rapidly expanding working-age population with 610 million people under age 25, and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=238.84s)]
*  relatively few older people to care for. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=245.24s)]
*  India's rising population means it's likely to keep its economy growing, buy more of the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=248.24s)]
*  world's goods, and play a bigger role in global affairs. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=252.76s)]
*  But India's rise isn't assured. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=256.52s)]
*  India is primarily a rural nation and still lags behind China in urbanization. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=271.64s)]
*  Unlike China, where millions of migrant laborers move to cities to work in factories, many [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  Indians are reluctant to leave their hometowns. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=281.53999999999996s)]
*  India also significantly lags behind China in terms of female labor participation. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=284.88s)]
*  India's cultural norms have meant that families who can afford to keep their daughters and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  wives at home prefer to do so. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=294.04s)]
*  When Mao took power, he really pushed the idea that women is equal to men. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=296.32s)]
*  For a long time, China's women labor participation rate has been very high. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  And for India, that seemed to be not the case. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=306.56s)]
*  Whatever happens, the world's future population will be tilted more towards the global south [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=310.12s)]
*  and South Asia in particular. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=315.04s)]
*  In 2060, the three successor states to pre-independence India will have 2.3 billion people versus [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=316.92s)]
*  China's 1.2 billion, guaranteeing profound changes to the global economy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib7JDV6_wb4&t=323.56s)]
