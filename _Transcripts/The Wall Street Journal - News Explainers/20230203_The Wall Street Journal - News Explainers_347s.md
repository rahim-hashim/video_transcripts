# The Man Richer Than Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o)
*  This man rubbing shoulders with the likes of Natalie Portman, Paul McCartney and Rihanna [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=0.0s)]
*  is French business mogul Bernard Arnaud. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=5.04s)]
*  While he might not be as recognisable as those three, he's got more money than all of them [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=8.2s)]
*  combined. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=11.8s)]
*  Arnaud is the world's richest person, with a net worth of $191 billion at the start of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=12.8s)]
*  2023. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=19.36s)]
*  He is one of the most important businessmen in the world, certainly the most important [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=20.36s)]
*  in France right now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=23.84s)]
*  He is the CEO of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which is basically the first word [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=25.52s)]
*  in luxury. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=30.12s)]
*  In addition to Louis Vuitton, the conglomerate includes brands such as Dior, Tiffany's and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=31.12s)]
*  Belvedere Vodka. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=35.4s)]
*  Luxury for me is how can you create desire. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=36.76s)]
*  He's been in charge of LVMH since 1989 and all of his children have powerful roles within [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=42.64s)]
*  the business. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=47.0s)]
*  Here's how Bernard Arnaud built his wealth and how he plans to keep it under family control. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=48.0s)]
*  The richest person in the world isn't a tabloid mainstay or red carpet regular, even if he [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  is seen on the front row at his brand's fashion shows. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  He's a guy who is somewhat shy, even maybe a tiny bit awkward. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=62.92s)]
*  There's a saying which gets repeated to me constantly by French billionaires and French [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  CEOs, which is, for vivre au ruil, for vivre caché, which basically means to live happily, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=74.12s)]
*  you have to live hidden. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=79.44s)]
*  The beginning of the Arnaud empire starts with an acquisition, which would become something [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=80.72s)]
*  of a modus operandi for him over the next 30 years. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=84.28s)]
*  In 1984, he took over Boussac, the holding company that owned French fashion house Christian Dior. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=87.28s)]
*  Christian Dior is maybe the most recognisable and the most well-known fashion name in the world. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=92.88s)]
*  He sold off pretty much all of the group's brands but Dior and pulled it out of bankruptcy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  In the late 80s, Dior's revival helped Arnaud amass a stake in the recently founded LVMH, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=105.0s)]
*  of which he soon became the majority shareholder, CEO and chairman. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=109.88000000000001s)]
*  Over 30 years and several acquisitions later, LVMH now includes 75 brands covering wine, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=114.68s)]
*  jewellery, hotels and fashion. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=120.2s)]
*  The European company has also expanded into China and the US, where Arnaud once joined [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=123.04s)]
*  then-President Donald Trump at the opening of a Louis Vuitton factory in Texas. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=127.64000000000001s)]
*  He's a great gentleman, a great businessman and he's really an artist. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=132.16s)]
*  To me, Bernard is an artist and what he's done is incredible. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=135.16s)]
*  The luxury giant now has a market value of nearly $438bn and revenue last year was around $86bn. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=139.8s)]
*  These results have boosted Arnaud's wealth and put him above the likes of big tech billionaires [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=147.44s)]
*  such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=151.6s)]
*  While those men have seen their company shares drop in recent months, LVMH's share price [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=154.12s)]
*  is up over 165% since lows in March of 2020. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  Though the stock market is apparently not something Arnaud pays attention to. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  I never look at a stock exchange but I never sell stock. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=166.64s)]
*  That price boost was thanks to a surge in demand for luxury goods during the pandemic [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=170.68s)]
*  when affluent shoppers were stuck at home flushed with cash. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=174.6s)]
*  And more recently, China's loosening of strict Covid-19 rules. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=177.6s)]
*  The country is one of the luxury industry's biggest markets. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=181.48s)]
*  Bernard Arnaud himself has a tonne of legitimacy because he built up this company from scratch, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=184.76s)]
*  he built this empire. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=190.16s)]
*  Through several battles he's obviously involved in all the key aspects of the business. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=191.88s)]
*  Also involved in key aspects of the business are his five children, who are often seen [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=197.16s)]
*  with him at brand events. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=201.16s)]
*  Let's meet the family. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=202.92s)]
*  Arnaud married his first wife, Anne de Wavrin, in 1973 and they had two children, Delphine [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=205.24s)]
*  and Antoine. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=209.68s)]
*  Delphine is the newly minted CEO of Christine Dior, while her younger brother Antoine is [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=211.84s)]
*  CEO of the family holding company. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=215.96s)]
*  After divorcing Anne, Arnaud married Helene Mercier and had three more children. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  Alexandra holds an executive vice president position at Tiffany's, the American jeweller [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=223.88s)]
*  LVMH took over in 2021. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=227.28s)]
*  Frédéric is CEO watchmaker Tang Hauer. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=229.68s)]
*  And Jean heads up marketing development for Louis Vuitton watches. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=232.92s)]
*  We can aim for long-term success because you are all associated with a family business, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=236.4s)]
*  a company controlled by my family. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=243.4s)]
*  The Arnaud's own more than 97% of Dior, which in turn owns 41% of LVMH. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=246.64s)]
*  The family also owns close to 7% of LVMH directly. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=250.92s)]
*  On top of that, they have total voting rights of more than 60%. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=254.39999999999998s)]
*  So essentially what the Arnaud's and what Bernard Arnaud himself decides goes in that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=259.2s)]
*  company. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=264.28s)]
*  And Arnaud has taken steps to ensure his family retains control over the empire. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=265.28s)]
*  Last year, LVMH voted to raise the age limit of its CEO, meaning the 73-year-old Arnaud [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=269.56s)]
*  could remain in charge until he's 80, if he wishes. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=274.91999999999996s)]
*  He also changed the structure of the family holding company. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=277.79999999999995s)]
*  The children will each have a 20% stake in this structure and they can't sell their [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=280.44s)]
*  shares for 30 years and essentially will keep the shares in the family even beyond that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=285.84s)]
*  And it's one of the kind of favourite pastimes in Parisian business circle to kind of watch [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=290.35999999999996s)]
*  his children and track their progress with a view to succession. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=295.32s)]
*  Arnaud has not publicly named a successor, but whoever it is will inherit a company that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=299.2s)]
*  has successfully navigated the pandemic amid concerns for the future of the industry. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=302.88s)]
*  High inflation and the war in Ukraine have prompted estimates of a slowdown in luxury [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=307.36s)]
*  goods sales in 2023. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=310.68s)]
*  And in China, a recent wave of Covid infections means life there remains disrupted. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=313.0s)]
*  Economists also haven't ruled out a global recession. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=317.76s)]
*  For now, though, at least, the luxury market's wealthy customers seem happy to keep spending. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=320.08s)]
*  The luxury goods industry has been a good one for investors in part because global wealth [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=325.7s)]
*  every year is rising. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=330.88s)]
*  And so more and more people are coming into the luxury goods market each year and that's [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=333.2s)]
*  obviously good for LVMH, for Bernard Arnaud and for people selling luxury goods. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgWmQ_6M_2o&t=337.2s)]
