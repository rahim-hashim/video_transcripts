# How Cloud Computing Became a Big Tech Battleground  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 02, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM)
*  IBM, Google, Microsoft. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=0.0s)]
*  All are making big bets on cloud computing. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=3.4s)]
*  That's for good reason. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=6.76s)]
*  Research firm Gartner forecasts public cloud revenues [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  to exceed $260 billion in 2020. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=10.84s)]
*  For years, Amazon's AWS led the market, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=14.84s)]
*  but that lead is starting to slip [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=17.84s)]
*  as other firms make moves [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=19.48s)]
*  to bolster their cloud computing offerings. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=20.96s)]
*  In October, Microsoft surprised onlookers [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=23.6s)]
*  when it won the US military's Jedi cloud contract. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=26.32s)]
*  It could be worth $10 billion over 10 years. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=29.64s)]
*  Weeks later, Amazon filed a protest of this decision [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  to the US court of federal claims. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  In July, IBM spent $34 billion to acquire Red Hat [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=37.52s)]
*  and boost its cloud business. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  So why are tech firms going to battle for cloud services? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=43.32s)]
*  To understand, you've got to know the basics. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, like any market that grows, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=48.64s)]
*  it's strong because it offers a value proposition to people [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=51.16s)]
*  that they find attractive, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  and so they shift their spending. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=55.44s)]
*  Cloud computing at its core is about changing the way [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=57.36s)]
*  that businesses manage data. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=59.96s)]
*  Everything done online, shopping, video, texts, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=61.8s)]
*  it all takes data. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=65.28s)]
*  The data is processed in behind-the-scenes computers [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=66.52s)]
*  called servers. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=69.04s)]
*  Managing that equipment takes time, energy, and money. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=70.32s)]
*  When a business moves to the cloud, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=74.12s)]
*  it's really just outsourcing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=75.88s)]
*  In other words, tech firms like Amazon [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=77.44s)]
*  handle some IT services [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=79.44s)]
*  so businesses can focus on what they do best. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=81.12s)]
*  Startups who use a cloud provider [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=84.52s)]
*  won't have to spend as much on a custom data center. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=86.04s)]
*  They can use resources from a third party. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=88.8s)]
*  In-house IT has to maintain enough server space [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=91.32s)]
*  to account for peak demand. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=94.12s)]
*  That could mean that your company has a bigger data center [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=95.92s)]
*  than it needs on a consistent basis. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=98.44s)]
*  Instead, cloud computing lets companies pool their resources. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=100.72s)]
*  The companies use as many servers as they need [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=104.32s)]
*  and only pay for what they consume. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=106.72s)]
*  Companies that use the cloud [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=109.52s)]
*  can benefit from the remote management of data [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=110.92s)]
*  in places like Ashburn, Virginia. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=113.16s)]
*  Amazon, IBM, and others host some of their data centers [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=115.48s)]
*  in less populated areas like this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  Both energy and land can be cheaper here [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=120.84s)]
*  than, say, a city center. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=123.16s)]
*  You even see groups like Facebook and the NSA [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=125.04s)]
*  opening private data centers in small towns in Utah. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=127.4s)]
*  There's potential for lower costs. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=130.52s)]
*  The views aren't bad either. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=132.44s)]
*  Cloud computing is tougher for some businesses than others. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=134.24s)]
*  In the years after the launch of AWS, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=137.52s)]
*  businesses like Netflix, Lyft, and Slack [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=139.88s)]
*  launched products with intense IT demands. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=142.4s)]
*  They were a natural fit for cloud computing. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=145.2s)]
*  Some companies who are moving to the cloud today are bigger [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=147.72s)]
*  and are in more regulated industries like health and finance. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=150.52s)]
*  They're companies like JP Morgan, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=154.0s)]
*  which operates under strict standards [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  from regulators like FINRA. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=157.16s)]
*  In 2017, Dana Deese was the chief information officer. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=158.92s)]
*  At the time, he moved portions [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=163.12s)]
*  of the financial giant's data to the cloud. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=165.0s)]
*  His next task will be even more formidable. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=167.68s)]
*  Do the same for the Defense Department. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=170.24s)]
*  So I've mentioned we have a need for an enterprise cloud. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=172.4s)]
*  So we have massive compute capability [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  where we can start to store our data [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  in a more common way and make it accessible. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  The multi-billion Joint Enterprise Defense Initiative [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  is supposed to centralize the military's technology [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=185.8s)]
*  and reap gains in innovation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=188.24s)]
*  Getting there will mean untangling years [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  of different IT systems. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=192.12s)]
*  That will take time, money, and expertise, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=193.96s)]
*  which is why Microsoft's potential win is so significant. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=196.76s)]
*  Amazon is no longer the only big name in cloud computing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=200.4s)]
*  Microsoft's Azure cloud service was announced three years [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=204.04s)]
*  after Amazon AWS took an early lead. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=207.08s)]
*  More than a decade has passed, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=210.12s)]
*  and AWS still dwarfs Azure in revenues. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  But more deals are on the horizon. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=215.0s)]
*  The cloud markets are still relatively small. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=216.96s)]
*  So their growth rate naturally is gonna be higher. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=220.4s)]
*  And we do see that growth rate coming down slightly [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=222.96s)]
*  over time as the cloud markets get bigger. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  But the strong growth rates are still driven by the fact [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=228.56s)]
*  that people prefer cloud models over the traditional models [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=232.08s)]
*  for a lot of their workloads. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=235.76s)]
*  Which is why you see the largest firms in tech [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=238.48s)]
*  betting big on the cloud. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=241.08s)]
*  Billions of dollars hang in the balance. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7MqvJAKLoM&t=242.68s)]
