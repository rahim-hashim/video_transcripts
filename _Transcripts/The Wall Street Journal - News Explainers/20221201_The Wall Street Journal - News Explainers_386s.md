# The 1933 Law Behind the SEC's Crypto Strategy | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI)
*  FTX, Celsius, BlockFi. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=0.0s)]
*  A wave of bankruptcies is hitting the crypto industry [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=3.88s)]
*  and policymakers are calling for regulation. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=7.2s)]
*  Regulatory framework. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=10.44s)]
*  We really need to make sure that that environment [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=11.68s)]
*  has the appropriate regulatory guardrails. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=14.08s)]
*  To find out how Washington might regulate [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=17.2s)]
*  the crypto industry moving forward, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=19.6s)]
*  let's look at a few past SEC investigations [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=21.6s)]
*  that reveal how the agency sees crypto. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=24.52s)]
*  In 2020, the SEC sued cryptocurrency company Ripple [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=28.32s)]
*  over the company's coin, XRP. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  It is by far the biggest piece of litigation [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=34.28s)]
*  that the SEC has against a cryptocurrency. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=37.52s)]
*  The agency charged two Ripple executives [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  with engaging in an illegal securities offering [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=43.04s)]
*  by selling XRP. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=45.6s)]
*  The agency argued that it wasn't a currency. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=47.36s)]
*  It was a security, making the distinction [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=50.04s)]
*  using the Securities Act of 1933. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=52.64s)]
*  The law says that if something is an investment contract [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=55.68s)]
*  or one form of a security, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=58.56s)]
*  it can be regulated under this act. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=60.52s)]
*  But the courts didn't clarify what that was [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=63.04s)]
*  until a Supreme Court case in 1946. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=65.48s)]
*  To call something an investment contract, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=69.0s)]
*  it has to pass a test, aptly named the Howey Test. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=71.0s)]
*  There's just three questions. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=75.04s)]
*  First, has someone invested money? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=77.8s)]
*  Then, is there a common enterprise? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=80.68s)]
*  Is the success of the buyer intertwined with the seller? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=83.64s)]
*  And third, is the buyer led to expect profits [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=87.4s)]
*  derived from others? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=90.48s)]
*  If all the answers are yes, it's a security. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=92.2s)]
*  The Ripple lawsuit says the SEC are holding their ground [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=94.88s)]
*  and insisting that this whole new world of crypto [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=98.24s)]
*  is really just a new form of the same old function, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=101.44s)]
*  which is to issue a kind of an asset [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=105.36s)]
*  in order to raise money to build a business. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=108.44s)]
*  But some crypto companies, like Ripple, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=110.68s)]
*  don't accept this idea. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=113.04s)]
*  They say their products aren't securities. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=115.0s)]
*  They're commodities, like gold. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=117.2s)]
*  They say that digital assets with a real-world purpose [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=119.48s)]
*  don't trade because of the seller. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=122.4s)]
*  There is no common enterprise, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=124.2s)]
*  so the tokens aren't securities. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=125.88s)]
*  Ripple said the SEC was acting outside their legal limits, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=128.12s)]
*  and they would continue to fight the case. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=131.48s)]
*  In September, both parties filed motions [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=133.68s)]
*  asking a federal judge to render a verdict. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=136.16s)]
*  With this case, the SEC took its biggest shot [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=138.76s)]
*  at broadly establishing its jurisdiction [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  over the crypto market. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=143.64s)]
*  Then, a year later, the SEC took the same law [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=145.11999999999998s)]
*  and applied it to a new part of the industry, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=148.48s)]
*  crypto lending. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=151.12s)]
*  It started investigating BlockFi, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  a platform that allowed users to loan crypto [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  to others for trading. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  BlockFi was doing something [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=158.92s)]
*  that the SEC had not yet enforced against. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=160.76s)]
*  And the SEC said that that transaction, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  that offering that BlockFi was doing [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=166.12s)]
*  was also an investment contract, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=168.88s)]
*  which is a form of a security. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=170.68s)]
*  For the case, the agency's reasoning was this. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  The way BlockFi's product worked [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=174.72s)]
*  is that it borrowed crypto assets from customers [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=176.28s)]
*  with the promise to repay it with interest. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=178.8s)]
*  That, as SEC said, counted as investment of money. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  BlockFi would lend those assets to institutional borrowers [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=184.52s)]
*  and keep some profits for itself, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=187.84s)]
*  their's common enterprise. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=189.8s)]
*  And based on BlockFi's statements about paying interest, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  the company led investors to expect profit. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  So, BlockFi's crypto lending accounts [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=197.8s)]
*  passed the Howey Test, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=200.16s)]
*  making it, in the SEC's eyes, a security. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=201.68s)]
*  The SEC moving into trying to regulate [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  crypto lending products [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=207.44s)]
*  shows you that a lot of this crypto ecosystem [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=210.72s)]
*  resembles traditional finance. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=214.76s)]
*  And the SEC, therefore, is going to look at that and say, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=217.56s)]
*  that looks like the kind of thing we regulate. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=222.16s)]
*  BlockFi settled for $100 million, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=224.52s)]
*  the highest fine ever agreed to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=227.12s)]
*  by a cryptocurrency company. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=229.0s)]
*  BlockFi CEO, Zach Prince, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=230.96s)]
*  said the company cooperated with regulators. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=232.6s)]
*  We have a long history of compliance [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=235.16s)]
*  and working with regulators, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=236.64s)]
*  and this is another example of that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=237.76s)]
*  BlockFi, which filed for bankruptcy in November, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=239.48s)]
*  did not reply to a request for comment. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=242.12s)]
*  But the case expanded the SEC's use of the Howey Test [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=244.68s)]
*  to regulate crypto, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=247.64s)]
*  showing the agency was willing to target [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  non-traditional digital assets. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=251.12s)]
*  Then, later in 2022, the agency took aim [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=253.16s)]
*  at a different part of the industry. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=256.44s)]
*  Celebrity endorsements, though, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=258.4s)]
*  don't mean that an investment product is right for you, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=260.44s)]
*  or even, frankly, that it's legitimate. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=264.4s)]
*  The SEC was prosecuting celebrities [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=268.2s)]
*  for advertising crypto. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=270.67999999999995s)]
*  For example, let's look at the agency's recent action [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=272.76s)]
*  against Kim Kardashian. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=276.08s)]
*  In September 2021, Kardashian posted a video [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=278.4s)]
*  and swipe-up story on Instagram, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  promoting Ethereum max tokens, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=283.44s)]
*  and was paid $250,000 for the post. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=285.6s)]
*  The SEC said that because Ethereum max was a security, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=289.44s)]
*  with, you guessed it, an investment of money, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=292.72s)]
*  common enterprise, and a reasonable expectation of profits, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=295.92s)]
*  the agency argued that Kardashian's post [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=299.88s)]
*  should be regulated under another part [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=302.12s)]
*  of the Securities Act that said she couldn't advertise [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=304.16s)]
*  a security without revealing that Ethereum max paid her. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=306.76000000000005s)]
*  The SEC fined her over a million dollars [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  for the lack of disclosure. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  Kardashian did not respond to a request for comment. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=314.88s)]
*  These cases, because they involve celebrities, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=317.92s)]
*  they allow the SEC to amplify their message [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=320.96s)]
*  to a much broader audience [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=323.76s)]
*  than the SEC's enforcement actions typically reach. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=326.0s)]
*  The cases against Ripple, BlockFi, and Kardashian [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=329.24s)]
*  show the SEC's strategy [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=332.48s)]
*  for applying securities regulations to crypto. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=334.2s)]
*  The SEC is going to continue to apply these laws to crypto [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=337.44s)]
*  unless and until Congress decides that crypto [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=343.44s)]
*  should fall under its own sort of customized [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=348.36s)]
*  regulatory regime. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=351.04s)]
*  The SEC said in May it would add 20 new investigators [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=352.44s)]
*  to its crypto unit. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=355.64s)]
*  But if regulations changed, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=356.88s)]
*  some of the crypto market could fall [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=358.68s)]
*  under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=360.64s)]
*  the SEC's sister agency. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=362.92s)]
*  We are gonna continue to see a lot of the same kinds [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=365.2s)]
*  of enforcement actions, but we don't know yet [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9eYmDXXRI&t=368.0s)]
