# How Doctors Stay Safe Battling Coronavirus | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 24, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ)
*  These are Chinese medical workers arriving at Wuhan Red Cross Hospital with a patient suspected of infection with a new coronavirus. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The workers are wearing personal protective equipment, or PPE, designed to prevent exposure to infectious materials. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=8.84s)]
*  Infections and deaths from the novel coronavirus have continued to rise throughout China and around the world. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=16.68s)]
*  According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, how the new virus spreads isn't completely understood. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=23.96s)]
*  Here's the protective equipment that health care workers have worn during major outbreaks such as SARS and Ebola, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=30.96s)]
*  and why it's crucial in the battle against the novel coronavirus epidemic. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=36.28s)]
*  PPE is used for a variety of hazards. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=40.6s)]
*  In the health care world, one of the biggest hazards is microbial, and that could be viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=43.8s)]
*  Some are fine air particles that enter your lungs. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=50.8s)]
*  Some are contact materials. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=54.12s)]
*  Others can enter through various orifices, your nose or eyes. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=56.8s)]
*  So when we're choosing PPE, it's very important to understand the transmission. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  Coronavirus is likely spread through a cough, sneeze or other contact with saliva. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  But because much is unknown about the virus, health care workers are following precautions to prevent different types of exposure. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=70.64s)]
*  So today when you look at personal protective equipment for microbial risks such as coronavirus, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  you're looking at four items, and they would be a face shield, followed by a respirator of some sort, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=83.44s)]
*  followed by a disposable coverall, and finally gloves. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=89.56s)]
*  Coveralls, face shields, goggles and gloves protect against hazards like Ebola that can spread by direct contact with bodily fluids. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  The respirator prevents inhaling droplets in the air from sneezes and coughs. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=103.92s)]
*  Health care workers wear respirators while treating patients during the SARS and MERS outbreaks. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=107.8s)]
*  The most sort of effective way of these pathogens entering your body is through the respiratory system. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  So that's why most PPE in health care settings tends to focus around respiratory protection, protecting what comes into your lungs. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  The highly infectious nature of Ebola led to the death of health care workers in Africa and exposed a potential fatal flaw in the use of PPE. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=128.88s)]
*  We learned very quickly that the sequence of taking off the clothing was very critical. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  We had people making the mistake of taking off their gloves and then taking off their respirator or their eyeglasses or their face shield. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=141.84s)]
*  And that simple mistake of taking one off before the other contaminated them. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=150.0s)]
*  And of course, they ended up with the disease. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=155.16s)]
*  The Ebola epidemic prompted an update of PPE guidelines by the WHO. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=158.16s)]
*  A global shortage of masks has emerged as everyday people try to protect themselves from the virus. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=163.4s)]
*  As you travel the streets of any city, especially in these days, you'll see a variety of respiratory protection. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=169.84s)]
*  You'll see people wearing bandanas. You'll see people wearing surgical masks. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=176.8s)]
*  You'll see people wearing very colorful masks that they buy downtown. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  While both respirators and surgical masks are effective at filtering out large droplets, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  surgical masks are less effective at filtering out smaller droplets which can be inhaled through the sides of the mask. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=191.04s)]
*  So what we have here is an N95 respirator. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=196.64s)]
*  It's 95 percent efficient at particles down to 0.3 microns in diameter. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=199.44s)]
*  Very, very small. As referenced, your hair is 50 microns. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=205.16s)]
*  So this is 0.3. It's a fraction of your hair. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=208.12s)]
*  As health care officials look to contain the spread of the coronavirus, they will rely on the availability and proper use of PPE in impacted areas. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=211.36s)]
*  The key to stopping this epidemic is a combination of isolating those that are infected and making sure no one gets reinfected. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=219.64s)]
*  And the key for that infection would be personal protective equipment. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  So it's not just about you wearing the equipment to protect your health. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  It's also about stopping the disease. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=236.84s)]
*  And in this case, personal protective equipment is really the vital answer to stopping this epidemic from spreading. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vulXSaTaJyQ&t=239.16s)]
