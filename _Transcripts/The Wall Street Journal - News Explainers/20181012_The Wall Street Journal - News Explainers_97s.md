# Markets Analysis Three Reasons the Fed Is Raising Interest Rates
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 12, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8)
*  Stock markets have been tumbling and President Trump is blaming the Federal Reserve. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=0.0s)]
*  He says the Fed's gone crazy raising short-term interest rates. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=4.64s)]
*  Higher interest rates not only do they spook investors, but they also make it harder and more costly to finance a rising budget deficit. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=8.48s)]
*  So why is the Fed doing this? Here's three reasons. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=15.8s)]
*  First of all, inflation has gotten back to the Fed's 2% target after running below it for most of this expansion. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=19.52s)]
*  With inflation back at the Fed's target, it stands to reason that interest rates should also be getting back to normal. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=27.12s)]
*  The Fed kept them near zero while inflation was running below target. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=33.52s)]
*  And now it's trying to get interest rates back towards around 3% on the short end. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=37.52s)]
*  They're getting closer to 5% for mortgage rates. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=42.72s)]
*  The other reason is unemployment. The unemployment rate hit 3.7% in September. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=45.52s)]
*  Low unemployment is a great thing for workers and for the economy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=51.52s)]
*  But we tend to see bad things happening when it gets too low. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=55.92s)]
*  We've had outbreaks of inflation or sometimes financial bubbles when it gets too low. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=58.92s)]
*  And the Fed wants to make sure that the economy doesn't overheat. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  Raising interest rates do that. So that's another reason why they've been pushing them higher. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=66.92s)]
*  The third reason is that growth has picked up. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=71.92s)]
*  Growth was near 2% for most of this expansion. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=74.62s)]
*  It's now closer to 3% on a year-on-year basis. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=77.72s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=81.12s)]
*  It means a stronger economy can bear higher interest rates. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=82.32s)]
*  So the Fed thinks that what it's doing is justified by the economy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=85.91999999999999s)]
*  And that it hasn't, as the president said, gone loco. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctpPsD76ye8&t=89.72s)]
