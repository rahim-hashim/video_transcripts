# How Middle East Tensions Could Complicate Iran Crash Investigation  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 10, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc)
*  On Wednesday, January 8, a Ukraine International Airlines jetliner crashed shortly after takeoff [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=0.0s)]
*  from Tehran, killing all 176 passengers and crew members on board. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=6.92s)]
*  The crash occurred hours after Iran fired a missile strike at U.S. forces in Iraq in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  retaliation for the killing of a top Iranian general. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=17.28s)]
*  According to U.S. officials and others, the early evidence suggests the flight, a Boeing [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=20.96s)]
*  737-800, was shot down by Iranian missiles. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=25.42s)]
*  We have intelligence from multiple sources, including our allies and our own intelligence. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=29.34s)]
*  The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=36.78s)]
*  This may well have been unintentional. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  This new information reinforces the need for a thorough investigation into this matter. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=48.58s)]
*  The process for determining the cause of a plane crash can take months or even years [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=55.42s)]
*  and often involves coordination between different countries. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=59.86s)]
*  But this time, with heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran, the process is facing complications. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=63.02s)]
*  Iranian officials had earlier said the plane suffered a technical fault. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=69.94s)]
*  A spokeswoman for the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said Ukraine is interested [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=73.26s)]
*  in finding the truth. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=78.48s)]
*  Therefore, I ask all our international partners, if you have any evidence to assist the investigation [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=79.86s)]
*  please provide it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=85.76s)]
*  International Protocol lays down specific guidelines for conducting post-crash investigations. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=88.0s)]
*  It's a very fluid process. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=93.04s)]
*  It's concurrent actions. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=94.8s)]
*  A lot of things are taking place at the same time. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=95.8s)]
*  Dr. Daniel Kwasi Adjekum is a former investigator with more than two decades of experience in aviation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=99.16s)]
*  Investigations are usually conducted under the auspices of the government of the country [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  where the crash takes place. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=109.92s)]
*  The country of occurrence is taking the lead of the accident. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=111.6s)]
*  The country of registry, an operator of the aircraft, will be notified so that they can [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=116.32s)]
*  send in what we call an accredited representative to be part of the investigation. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  The country of design and manufacture of the aircraft is going to be part of it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=128.0s)]
*  So these are the major stakeholders. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=133.12s)]
*  In a more typical accident probe involving a U.S. manufactured plane, at least some U.S. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=136.54s)]
*  safety experts would be on their way to the site within a day or two. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=141.36s)]
*  But given the diplomatic and security issues clouding this accident, decisions about U.S. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=144.84s)]
*  participation are in limbo. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=148.96s)]
*  Dr. Adjekum said that countries with a high portion of citizens aboard the flight may [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=151.16000000000003s)]
*  also become involved in the investigation. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=155.4s)]
*  Even under less fraught circumstances, collaboration between multiple countries can be difficult. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  Dr. Adjekum said that in previous crashes like Ethiopia Airlines Flight 302, healthy [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=163.36s)]
*  diplomatic relations made it safe for the two countries to collaborate. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=168.44s)]
*  But even then, investigators tussled over where to send the planes black boxes. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=171.72s)]
*  But in this case, because of the peculiar situation where the two of them cannot reconcile, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=176.68s)]
*  a third party entity might suffice. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=183.6s)]
*  So what could happen is that in such a situation, IKO might broker a third party. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=186.96s)]
*  Most likely, the French or the Germans might be brought in by the Iranians to do the readout. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=193.04s)]
*  Once an investigation shifts into national security or military issues, civil investigators [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  generally are relegated to a marginal role. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=207.23999999999998s)]
*  If they have hard evidence based on maybe satellite photography, which is sort of irrefutable, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=209.64s)]
*  then the dynamics change. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=220.0s)]
*  It becomes a criminal investigation. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=222.04s)]
*  When that happens, international treaties about data sharing and broad participation [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=224.4s)]
*  no longer apply, and participants tend to be focused on protecting intelligence sources. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=228.36s)]
*  Despite the hurdles, Iranian authorities have indicated through intermediaries, including [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=233.76s)]
*  the Civil Aviation Army of the United Nations, that they want the U.S. National Transportation [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=238.04s)]
*  Safety Board to provide technical assistance. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=242.72s)]
*  In the normal course, this also would mean some level of participation from the Federal [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=245.28s)]
*  Aviation Administration, Boeing, and General Electric Company, which made the plane's [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=249.76s)]
*  jets with a French joint venture partner. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82MX3hkeNc&t=254.23999999999998s)]
