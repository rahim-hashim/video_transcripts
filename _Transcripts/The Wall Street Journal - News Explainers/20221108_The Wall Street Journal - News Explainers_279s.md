# Midterm Elections Are Different This Year. Here’s Why  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ)
*  It's election day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=0.0s)]
*  While it's unclear which races Republicans and Democrats will win, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  It could be days, perhaps even longer, before we know the final midterm results. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=6.04s)]
*  what is certain is that this election looks different for voters across the U.S. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=10.28s)]
*  There are many laws in many states that voters are going to be having to navigate for the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=14.82s)]
*  first time this year. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=20.04s)]
*  In the wake of the contentious 2020 election, rules have changed and more observers have [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=22.02s)]
*  been deployed. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=28.16s)]
*  Here's a look at how the presidential election made a lasting impact and why some people [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=29.56s)]
*  are concerned that the changes we see this year, from voting regulations and voting [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=33.92s)]
*  methods to poll watchers, could affect voter turnout and the future of our elections. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=38.56s)]
*  At least 40 states have passed laws in the last two years that either tighten voting [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=46.04s)]
*  rules or expand voting access, according to NYU's Brennan Center for Justice, a public [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=49.92s)]
*  policy think tank that tracks election legislation. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  If we're talking about whether it's become harder or easier to vote, then I really think [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=58.56s)]
*  it depends on where a voter happens to live. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=62.2s)]
*  Since 2020, 28 states have passed measures that would make it easier for eligible Americans [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=65.64s)]
*  to register, stay on the rolls, or vote. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=70.82000000000001s)]
*  In Vermont, all registered voters will be mailed a ballot for the November presidential [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=74.06s)]
*  and midterm elections under a law passed in 2021. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=78.26s)]
*  And in Kentucky, a new law established three days of early in-person voting. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=82.36s)]
*  Expensive voting laws are a recognition by legislators that more access means a more [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=88.0s)]
*  full, fair, and engaged democracy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  Twenty states have passed laws that the Brennan Center classifies as restrictive, which can [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=97.2s)]
*  include measures that shorten windows to apply for a mail ballot, limit the availability [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=101.64s)]
*  of ballot drop boxes, impose stricter signature requirements, or impose stricter voter ID [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=106.84s)]
*  requirements. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  Among these are Arizona's HB 2492 law, which established a proof of citizenship requirement [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=115.12s)]
*  for voter registration, and Georgia's SB 202, which requires voters to provide an approved [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=121.08s)]
*  type of ID, like a driver's license or voter identification card, when requesting and returning [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  an absentee ballot. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  Republicans say the changes were needed to restore confidence among voters in the integrity [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=134.88s)]
*  of elections, while Democrats believe the law is meant to depress minority turnout, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=139.16s)]
*  and that former President Donald Trump and his supporters corroded faith in the process. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=144.26s)]
*  No evidence of widespread fraud has been found in the 2020 election, but the unsubstantiated [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  claims have motivated some people to get involved. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=155.85999999999999s)]
*  While poll watching is a common feature, where people monitor ballot casting and counting [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=160.1s)]
*  for possible rule violations, there are concerns that highly partisan volunteers could try [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=164.01999999999998s)]
*  to intimidate voters this year. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=168.94s)]
*  One of the features of our election system is this transparency, the ability for people [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=171.42s)]
*  to watch and observe, but it also does create a vulnerability if a bad actor gets in. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=175.22s)]
*  Trey Grayson oversaw two presidential elections and two midterm elections as Kentucky's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=180.45999999999998s)]
*  Secretary of State. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=185.22s)]
*  We have to make sure that the observers aren't intimidating voters or doing something that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=186.61999999999998s)]
*  they shouldn't be doing during that observation process. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=190.22s)]
*  The RNC says it has recruited over 123,000 poll workers and poll watchers in primary, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=194.01999999999998s)]
*  general and special elections this cycle. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=200.26s)]
*  The DNC said state-level Democratic parties take the lead on recruiting poll watchers. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=203.14s)]
*  It all comes back to balancing the transparency of our system with not wanting folks to be [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  intimidated. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=213.62s)]
*  We don't want voters to feel like somebody's watching or will do something to them, and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=214.62s)]
*  that causes them to not vote. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=218.73999999999998s)]
*  More than 43 million ballots have been cast as of November 7th, and there are signs that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=221.22s)]
*  this year's elections could meet or possibly exceed 2018's midterm turnout. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=226.02s)]
*  It'll take until well after the election, when most or all mail-in ballots have been [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=231.02s)]
*  counted before we get a full picture of voter participation. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=234.94s)]
*  We'll find out if that's just a sign of people shifting their voting preference or a sign [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=238.46s)]
*  of high overall turnout. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=242.78s)]
*  A recent Wall Street Journal poll shows voter enthusiasm is high, with 81% of respondents [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=245.74s)]
*  saying they definitely will vote this year and 8% saying they already have. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=251.26000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to be looking for some of these new laws that we're seeing in states, how [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=255.98000000000002s)]
*  they work, how they impact turnout, and also the poll watcher issue. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=258.94s)]
*  And then finally, I want to see the results of some of these election administrator races, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=263.02s)]
*  secretary of states, and a few governors that appoint secretaries, because that could have [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=266.38s)]
*  a tremendous impact on the future of our elections. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kRcB9PuXxQ&t=270.14s)]
