# How Lithium Became a Hot Commodity  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 20, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8)
*  When it comes to electric vehicle manufacturing, few resources are as vital as lithium. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=0.0s)]
*  Over the past decade, prospectors unearthed troves of the lithium chemicals that power [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=8.2s)]
*  batteries, but the shift toward a cleaner economy is accelerating, and batteries play [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=13.4s)]
*  a central role. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  As a result, demand for lithium is expected to exceed supply through 2025. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=20.44s)]
*  Powermakers and analysts say that more lithium is needed to produce more batteries at a [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=27.68s)]
*  faster pace. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=32.28s)]
*  And as China takes a leading role in the battery supply chain, the U.S. government is trying [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=34.16s)]
*  to boost domestic supply of the metal. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=39.2s)]
*  Here's how lithium became such a hot commodity. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=42.08s)]
*  Lithium is scattered not only across the U.S., but the entire world. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=47.86s)]
*  In the top lithium-producing country, Australia, miners excavate a mineral called spodumene, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=53.42s)]
*  which contains the metal. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=58.86s)]
*  And in Chile and Argentina, companies extract lithium from massive salt lakes by pumping [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=61.300000000000004s)]
*  water into the ground. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=66.54s)]
*  The extracted metals are mixed with other elements to produce compounds like lithium [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=69.62s)]
*  hydroxide and lithium carbonate. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=74.08s)]
*  These compounds are a key part of many batteries. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=77.78s)]
*  Powermakers and battery researchers like Dr. Guihayu value lithium because of its unique [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=81.78s)]
*  chemical properties. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=87.26s)]
*  Lithium ions, being so small, they can be very easily recharged as they diffuse quickly [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=88.26s)]
*  during battery charge discharge. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=94.78s)]
*  Lithium ions are also very lightweight, so batteries based on lithium ions can offer [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=96.42s)]
*  high energy, meaning that a lot of energy can be packed in a small amount or small volume [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=101.66s)]
*  of materials. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=106.94s)]
*  These two properties, energy density and rechargeability, are the reason why lithium is found in so [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=108.74s)]
*  many batteries. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=113.8s)]
*  Inside of all batteries are two major components, the cathode and the anode. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=115.69999999999999s)]
*  Compounds that contain lithium ions transfer from one component when power is drawn down, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=120.33999999999999s)]
*  and they return when the battery is recharging. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=125.5s)]
*  They can be charged hundreds or thousands of times. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=127.74s)]
*  So they have different kind of degradation kind of mechanism. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=131.88s)]
*  Lithium ions are so small, so they are very stable. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=134.86s)]
*  So that's the reason why the lithium ion can offer at least these years of use. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=137.98000000000002s)]
*  Scientists have spent decades perfecting lithium based batteries. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=143.86s)]
*  Lithium was discovered in 1817, but more than a century passed before businesses used the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=147.8s)]
*  chemical in mainstream batteries. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  In the 1990s, Sony took advantage of new lightweight lithium ion batteries in a design for a handheld [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=156.26000000000002s)]
*  video camera. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=161.88000000000002s)]
*  The result was the Handycam, a smash commercial hit. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=163.58s)]
*  Shortly afterward, rechargeable batteries began to appear in laptops and smartphones. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=167.18s)]
*  And batteries are increasingly used in conjunction with wind and solar power. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=173.46s)]
*  Analysts like Simon Moores point out that demand for the chemical is growing as companies [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=179.22000000000003s)]
*  build bigger battery powered machines. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=183.18s)]
*  People need more lithium today and in the future than in the past because you're going [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=186.54000000000002s)]
*  So it's an order of magnitude bigger and as a result you need an order of magnitude more [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=191.1s)]
*  of lithium supply. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=205.66s)]
*  Which means that mining companies around the world are searching for lithium. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=207.82s)]
*  In the United States, companies like Lithium Americas and Piedmont Lithium are looking [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=212.14000000000001s)]
*  for metal-bearing spodumene minerals in familiar places. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=216.86s)]
*  In the past, lithium from the tin spodumene belt of the Carolinas was used in the production [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=221.10000000000002s)]
*  of both medication and nuclear weapons. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=225.56s)]
*  Today prospectors are fanning out in search of new deposits here, as well as in Arkansas, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=228.9s)]
*  Nevada, and California. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=233.70000000000002s)]
*  The search is based on expectations of consumer demand for electric vehicles. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=236.46s)]
*  It takes four to seven years to build a lithium mine. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=241.5s)]
*  It takes 24 months to build a battery plant. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=244.7s)]
*  These two parts of the supply chain, they don't live in the same time zones. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=247.54s)]
*  And that is the major challenge, is matching the supply when the demand is needed. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=250.98s)]
*  And at present, the industry has really failed to date. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=256.3s)]
*  Even though EV sales currently make up about 2% of the US auto market, that share is expected [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=260.53999999999996s)]
*  to grow to 10% by 2025, according to Morgan Stanley. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=265.94s)]
*  And policies coming out of Washington could further boost demand for battery components. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=271.26s)]
*  President Biden ordered a review of domestic supply chains for critical products. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=276.7s)]
*  That includes semiconductors, key minerals, pharmaceuticals, and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=281.53999999999996s)]
*  advanced batteries like the ones used in electric vehicles. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=285.94s)]
*  They're strong bipartisan support for fast reviews of these four areas because they're [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=289.98s)]
*  essential to protecting and strengthening American competitiveness. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=294.98s)]
*  President Biden's emphasis on supply chain is driven in part by geopolitics. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=298.94s)]
*  When it comes to lithium, only about 1% of global output is both mined and processed [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=303.82s)]
*  in the US. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=309.17999999999995s)]
*  China unearths about 10%. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=310.82s)]
*  China also processes about two thirds of the world's lithium supply and dominates the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=313.73999999999995s)]
*  global battery market. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=317.94s)]
*  The US government has said that relying on overseas sources for these materials creates [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=320.09999999999997s)]
*  a strategic vulnerability, which means that a new hunt for lithium is only getting started. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=324.92s)]
*  The race is on to see who will supply the world with this powerful metal. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGx8GAtTh8&t=331.12s)]
