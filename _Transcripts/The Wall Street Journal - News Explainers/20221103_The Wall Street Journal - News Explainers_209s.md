# An RSV Outbreak Is Taxing Pediatric Hospitals. Here's Why. | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs)
*  Rates of RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=0.0s)]
*  have been surging since August. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=3.4s)]
*  That's weeks earlier than the typical season. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=5.14s)]
*  Pediatric hospitals are pretty stressed right now. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=7.44s)]
*  So doctors are warning of a possible... [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=10.28s)]
*  Tripledemic. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=12.6s)]
*  That means cases of COVID flu and RSV, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=13.76s)]
*  a virus that's been impacting children, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  are all expected to rise. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Here's what to know about the surge in RSV [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=20.12s)]
*  and what it means for your winter. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=22.56s)]
*  RSV is a virus spread through droplets [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=25.32s)]
*  from coughing and sneezing and on surfaces. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=27.72s)]
*  It's so common that nearly all children [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=30.4s)]
*  come in contact with the virus by the age of two. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  And while RSV feels like a cold for most people, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=35.04s)]
*  it can be severe for some infants and older adults. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=38.04s)]
*  According to the CDC, about 58,000 children under five [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=41.12s)]
*  are hospitalized due to RSV every year. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=44.56s)]
*  In pre-COVID times, hospitalizations looked like this, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=47.28s)]
*  peaking in January. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=50.84s)]
*  But in the first year of the pandemic, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  RSV rates flattened. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=54.36s)]
*  That's because COVID safety measures, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=56.24s)]
*  like distancing and face masks, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=57.96s)]
*  also likely protected people from other diseases. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  But around the summer of 2021, cases of RSV shot up. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  Once you sort of start mingling again [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=66.88s)]
*  and dropping those restrictions, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=68.64s)]
*  you get a lot of cases happening at once. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=70.4s)]
*  There's no approved vaccine for RSV. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=72.6s)]
*  And children who didn't get sick from the virus [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=75.12s)]
*  in 2020 or 2021 might have less immunity protection. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=77.08s)]
*  And for this fall surge... [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=81.12s)]
*  There's a couple things at play here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  One of them sort of being that a lot of kids [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=84.28s)]
*  have gone back to school in the fall. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=86.88s)]
*  And this year, there was significantly less masking [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=89.0s)]
*  in a lot of schools and other safety precautions [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=92.16s)]
*  that there were for the past two years. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=94.19999999999999s)]
*  There's been less exposure. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=95.88s)]
*  Some of the tiniest kids haven't seen RSV before. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=97.52s)]
*  And so you have sort of a higher susceptible population [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=103.24s)]
*  among sort of the youngest. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=106.6s)]
*  This surge in RSV comes at a time [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=108.64s)]
*  when other respiratory illnesses, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  like the rhinovirus and enteroviruses, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=112.4s)]
*  have increased hospitalizations in children. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=114.84s)]
*  So doctors are bracing for more cases. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  The Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  is considering setting up a field hospital [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=122.4s)]
*  in case things get worse. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=124.64s)]
*  And some physicians are worried about precautionary measures [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  for high-risk infants. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=129.28s)]
*  Vulnerable babies, as a precaution, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  get injections of this monoclonal antibody [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=132.96s)]
*  during the normal respiratory season. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=135.24s)]
*  But if RSV strikes earlier or during the summer, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=137.68s)]
*  like a lot of those babies in most hospitals [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=141.84s)]
*  sort of can anticipate and keep up quickly, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  sort of lose that extra protection. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=146.4s)]
*  It's not just RSV. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=148.96s)]
*  The flu season arrived earlier than usual this year too. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=150.52s)]
*  There is a lack of exposure [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  because less people have had it for the past two seasons. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=155.4s)]
*  Lower vaccination rates because, you know, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  that's sort of a better way to build up exposure. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  Less precautions as people are heading inside [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=163.96s)]
*  and into schools and workplaces again. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=167.0s)]
*  And that, combined with a possible uptick in COVID cases, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=170.44s)]
*  has doctors worried about a triple threat [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=173.76s)]
*  of RSV, COVID, and flu. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=175.88s)]
*  A confluence of all of these viruses [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=178.12s)]
*  could put hospitals under serious strain this winter [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=180.52s)]
*  because for the last two winters, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=183.44s)]
*  hospitals were completely slammed entirely just with COVID. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=185.56s)]
*  What we saw during the pandemic [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=190.48s)]
*  is that if a hospital is overrun, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=191.84s)]
*  it's harder to get in for any other sort of care [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=193.64s)]
*  that you might need. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=196.56s)]
*  An overwhelmed hospital isn't good for anybody. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=197.72s)]
*  To help reduce hospital capacity, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=200.04s)]
*  health officials are encouraging people [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=202.16s)]
*  to get their flu and COVID vaccines. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8QIRAKAHKs&t=203.88s)]
