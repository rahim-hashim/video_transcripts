# Tesla vs. NIO: Battle for the World’s Largest EV Market | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 05, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM)
*  A little out of juice, only 42 kilometers range left, and that's why we need to come here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=0.0s)]
*  When Jeff Sha needs to get his car refueled, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=9.0s)]
*  he doesn't go to a gas station and not always one that charges electric vehicles. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=13.0s)]
*  Instead, he goes to a battery swap station. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=19.0s)]
*  In about five minutes, he can have his EV battery replaced with a fully charged one that has a driving range of up to 260 miles. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=22.0s)]
*  More than enough for the 42-year-old's daily commute to work. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=30.0s)]
*  And it's way faster than the gas station experience, I think. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=36.0s)]
*  Sha is driving a NIO, a rising star in China's electric vehicle market. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=43.0s)]
*  Once on the brink of bankruptcy, the startup was bailed out by the government and has since seen its share soar. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=48.0s)]
*  At the end of 2020, NIO is worth more than General Motors. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=54.0s)]
*  Ranking as the world's fifth most valuable automaker. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=57.0s)]
*  And that has a lot to do with its batteries. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=61.0s)]
*  In other words, a NIO customer doesn't need to buy the vehicle with the battery. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=71.0s)]
*  And so far, it's the only automaker in China to do this. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=76.0s)]
*  Many investors say NIO's commercial strategy is revolutionary. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=79.0s)]
*  So as Tesla speeds ahead as the market leader in China, should it be worried? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=82.0s)]
*  The gas station is on the big screen and there's the battery pack getting swapped out. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=89.0s)]
*  NIO isn't the first electric vehicle company to try switching out the battery. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=94.0s)]
*  You have the choice of a battery pack swap, which is faster than you can fill a gas tank. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=98.0s)]
*  In 2013, Tesla demoed its battery swap technology and the following year, built a trial swap station in California. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=104.0s)]
*  Tesla later dropped the project, saying drivers weren't interested in swapping their batteries because the supercharging stations were fast enough. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=113.0s)]
*  Even as these charges can take more than 75 minutes to fully power a car. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=121.0s)]
*  We'll be expanding the supercharger network quite substantially over time. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=126.0s)]
*  Despite Tesla pulling the plug on battery swaps, its Chinese rival NIO is moving ahead with the technology. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=132.0s)]
*  The concept of battery swapping is fairly straightforward. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=138.0s)]
*  The actual, actually implementing it and making a viable business out of it is quite a bit more complicated. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=142.0s)]
*  Sam Abiel-Samed is a car analyst who has been watching the EV industry for more than a decade. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=149.0s)]
*  Batteries are a single most expensive component in an electric vehicle. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=154.0s)]
*  But the problem is batteries are also still in a rapid stage of development. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=158.0s)]
*  And so to date, manufacturers have been reluctant to standardize anything. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=161.0s)]
*  But NIO is choosing to standardize the battery. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=168.0s)]
*  So while most electric vehicles have battery packs that are uniquely designed for specific models and are built into the cars, NIO has one battery pack that fits into all its models. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=171.0s)]
*  And this battery costs about $10,700. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=181.0s)]
*  So that means NIO's cheapest model, which costs around $52,000, gets a 20% discount if buyers choose to skip the battery. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=183.0s)]
*  The company said a third of its customers are buying cars without the battery. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=191.0s)]
*  Tesla and NIO, they have taken some different approaches to the business model. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=195.0s)]
*  I think battery swapping would certainly make NIO very competitive to Tesla and to other companies. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=200.0s)]
*  For a flat fee of about $150 a month, NIO drivers can get six battery packs in a month. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=206.0s)]
*  They can get battery replacements at more than 160 battery swap stations across China. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=213.0s)]
*  When you drive these gasoline vehicles, their service comes to the end when the dealer delivers the car to you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=218.0s)]
*  But for NIO, it's a very different experience. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=226.0s)]
*  NIO drivers also have other battery options like charging at home or using an app to request a charging truck to show up. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=229.0s)]
*  But its services and stations in China fall far short of what's needed to convince the world's largest EV market to uptake battery swap vehicles. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=235.0s)]
*  Just compare the number of NIO's battery swap stations to Tesla's supercharging stations in the country and the more than 2,000 stations it has worldwide. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=243.0s)]
*  And this is where the government comes into play. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=252.0s)]
*  Battery swap now is getting more attention, right? Looking to the policy support behind it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=255.0s)]
*  Xu Gong is an auto consultant based in Shanghai. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=263.0s)]
*  He says in the long run, government policy will likely determine how the EV industry in China develops. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=266.0s)]
*  Beijing already has a 2035 goal for broad EV adoption in the country. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=271.0s)]
*  We will continue to promote the construction of charging stations and improve the related technology standards and management policies. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=277.0s)]
*  Battery swapping is getting a push this year. For the first time, the technology was mentioned in China's annual policy blueprint. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=285.0s)]
*  There's also a subsidy that seems designed to help NIO. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=292.0s)]
*  Consumers who purchase battery swap vehicles with a minimum driving range of 250 miles can receive about $3,500 in subsidies. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=294.0s)]
*  However, electric vehicles without battery swaps can only qualify if priced below $46,000. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=303.0s)]
*  Tesla had to cut the price of its Model 3 in China by 10% to meet that threshold. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=309.0s)]
*  This type of support has persuaded other Chinese automakers to signal that they too could adopt the technology. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=314.0s)]
*  But Xu says it'll take a critical mass of automakers to commit before China runs in battery swaps. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=320.0s)]
*  You can think of it could be like a mobile or Chevrolet. They build the small station. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=326.0s)]
*  They provide a different type of batteries, you know, big size, small size to fit into different vehicles. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=333.0s)]
*  Tesla Shanghai Dragon Factory. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=339.0s)]
*  But Beijing isn't only supportive of NIO. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=341.0s)]
*  We want to very much say thank you and appreciation for the Shanghai government and the support. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=344.0s)]
*  About one year after Tesla started building its Gigafactory in Shanghai, it started delivering Model 3 sedans in China, far outpacing the sales of NIO vehicles. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=348.0s)]
*  We intend to continue making a significant investment and increasing the investment in China. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=360.0s)]
*  NIO is still playing catch up, but Jeff Shaw is betting on the future of the Chinese startup. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=367.0s)]
*  So much so that he bought shares of the company. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=372.0s)]
*  NIO is absolutely in the front line of our state of art. It's more than a brand. It's more than a vehicle. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrgH07lwfVM&t=374.0s)]
