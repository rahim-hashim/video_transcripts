# Why the Pandemic May Accelerate Airbus Investing in Greener Air Travel | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 27, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ)
*  Could commercial planes soon be powered by clean energy? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The aviation industry, which accounts for around 5% of all greenhouse gases, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=4.0s)]
*  has been experimenting with technologies like battery, solar and even hydrogen. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=8.0s)]
*  So far, none of these projects have gone beyond testing and are far from being commercially viable. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=13.0s)]
*  But in the midst of an industry-wide crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=18.0s)]
*  the world's largest plane maker, Airbus, announced plans to put zero-emission aircraft into commercial service by 2035. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=23.0s)]
*  We unveiled today three concept planes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=30.0s)]
*  So why now? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=34.0s)]
*  Well, economists, climate change experts and engineers alike are arguing that if governments attach climate conditions to bailouts handed out in the pandemic, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=36.0s)]
*  it could not only help save the aviation industry, but could also help reduce its carbon footprint and, crucially, create new jobs. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=44.0s)]
*  It's in these periods of recession and downturn that governments spend the most. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=52.0s)]
*  And so really it is the single greatest opportunity to redirect the future of our industries. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=57.0s)]
*  So could the coronavirus pandemic lead to green air travel? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=64.0s)]
*  The aviation industry has been hit hard by the pandemic. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=68.0s)]
*  A 95% drop in air travel in April has led to airlines cancelling orders for new planes, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=72.0s)]
*  and Boeing and Airbus axing tens of thousands of workers, with governments stepping in to provide aid. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=77.0s)]
*  In the US, $25 billion has been offered to US airlines through the CARES Act. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=83.0s)]
*  But some in the industry, as well as scholars and officials, believe that governments should be attaching climate conditions to stimulus. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=88.0s)]
*  There's an opportunity to combine economic performance and for positive environmental performance. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=95.0s)]
*  The benefits of adding green conditionality to these bailouts is that you both protect the current jobs and you induce new jobs, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=100.0s)]
*  both in the short term in some of the research-intensive industries, but then also in the long term in terms of actually building new products. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=110.0s)]
*  So what options are available for the sector to decarbonise? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=120.0s)]
*  Well, the industry has been exploring ideas for a few decades. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=124.0s)]
*  Despite its continued heavy dependency on kerosene-based jet fuel, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=128.0s)]
*  it has managed to reduce its emissions per passenger by some 70% since the 1960s, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=132.0s)]
*  simply by focusing on making planes that are lighter and can fly farther using less fuel. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=138.0s)]
*  The problem is, there are way more people flying now than there were in the 60s, and that's wiped out all of those gains. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=143.0s)]
*  And while researchers predict the pandemic will lead to emissions dropping by more than a third this year, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=150.0s)]
*  it's expected that air traffic will rebound in the coming years, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=155.0s)]
*  all of which leaves the sector nowhere closer to hitting targets of cutting CO2 emissions in half by 2050 compared to 2005 levels. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=158.0s)]
*  If we want to make another big change in emissions per passenger, we need to radically change things. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=168.0s)]
*  Gr√©goire Carpenter is co-founder of Supera de Carbo, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=177.0s)]
*  a group of former students from France's leading aviation university who are lobbying for the industry to decarbonise. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=180.0s)]
*  He believes that in its ambitions to become less carbon-intensive, the aviation industry faces a problem unlike many other industries. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=186.0s)]
*  There is a massive amount of energy in a minimum space. Otherwise, you cannot carry that energy in the air. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=194.0s)]
*  While many alternatives to jet fuel have been proposed, they all share one common problem. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=203.0s)]
*  Right now, nothing is as efficient or economical as kerosene. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=208.0s)]
*  Kerosene has been the most concentrated energy that we ever found. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=213.0s)]
*  Biofuels, derived from organic biomass, are an alternative that's already available, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=220.0s)]
*  but it's currently more expensive than kerosene and requires huge investment to achieve widespread availability. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=225.0s)]
*  Battery technology has been tested by some companies, including Airbus, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=231.0s)]
*  but the company believes they're just too heavy to be economically viable in planes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=235.0s)]
*  We don't believe that really it's a today relevant technology for large commercial aircraft. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=239.0s)]
*  And solar simply doesn't generate enough power. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=245.0s)]
*  This solar-powered plane, made by startup Solar Impulse, has a wingspan wider than a 747 and is as light as a family car, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=248.0s)]
*  but can still only average 47 miles per hour. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=255.0s)]
*  This is where Airbus is hoping hydrogen can become aviation's fuel of the future. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=258.0s)]
*  One particular technology pathway which we find most promising is hydrogen. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=263.0s)]
*  Remember those plane designs? Airbus has said it can have these hydrogen planes in production by 2035 [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=269.0s)]
*  and is hoping that by announcing them now, it can prompt the rest of the industry to follow suit. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=275.0s)]
*  We're putting a stake in the ground and making it very clear that the aviation industry [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=280.0s)]
*  needs to also be powered by renewable energy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=285.0s)]
*  But even hydrogen has its problems. Right now it's projected to be more expensive than kerosene [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=288.0s)]
*  and would take up more space, which means less seats on the plane. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=294.0s)]
*  It's four times more volumic than kerosene, so restore it in the fuselage again [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=297.0s)]
*  and you see this aft part of the fuselage being windowless. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=303.0s)]
*  There's also the problem that hydrogen is currently synthesised mostly by burning fossil fuels. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=308.0s)]
*  And while it might be good for powering small vehicles, it may not be efficient enough to power large planes on long haul flights. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=313.0s)]
*  At least in the first iteration of hydrogen aircraft technology, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=320.0s)]
*  long range will not be a market segment that we address. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=324.0s)]
*  And of course, none of this technology or its development comes cheap. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=329.0s)]
*  When talking about its ambition to make these planes, Airbus says... [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=334.0s)]
*  That is an ambition which will require billions in terms of investment. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=337.0s)]
*  Airbus hopes that some of that money will come from the government, if it's to turn its hydrogen concepts into a reality. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=342.0s)]
*  And that's why these bailout funds could come in. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=348.0s)]
*  In France, Airbus' home, the government has attached climate conditions to recent investments. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=351.0s)]
*  Air France, for example, was bailed out by the French government to the tune of some $8.2 billion in June this year, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=356.0s)]
*  under the condition that the airline halve its carbon emissions by 2030. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=362.0s)]
*  But while France may be using the pandemic to push for its aviation industry to reduce emissions, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=367.0s)]
*  for some countries, that opportunity may already have passed. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=372.0s)]
*  Brian O'Callaghan's research studied thousands of economic policies and found that many have not opted for climate conditions. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=376.0s)]
*  In total, we find that at least $140 billion has been spent on aviation. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=383.0s)]
*  Now, of that, we've seen only $14 billion, only 10% with green conditions. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=388.0s)]
*  That is 90% of airline bailouts that's going towards the continuation of a dirty industry without enabling the long-term transition. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaeFMog99jQ&t=393.0s)]
