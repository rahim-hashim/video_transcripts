# How Coronavirus Test Kits Work | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 26, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM)
*  Researchers around the world are hustling to create this test kit. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=0.0s)]
*  The rapidly spreading new coronavirus has put test kits at the center of how infected [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=7.12s)]
*  patients are diagnosed so they can get treatment quickly. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=11.36s)]
*  But there's one issue with these nose and throat swabbing tests. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=16.12s)]
*  The results aren't always accurate. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=19.6s)]
*  At the center of the epidemic in Wuhan, some people tested negative, only later to find [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=22.84s)]
*  out that they actually have the disease. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=27.48s)]
*  In the U.S., the CDC sent out test kits to public health labs that gave inconclusive [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=29.84s)]
*  results in the verification process. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=34.44s)]
*  The unreliability of these tests even forced Chinese health officials to expand how they [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=37.0s)]
*  classify patients, which resulted in a surge of more than 14,000 cases in one day. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=41.12s)]
*  They are now including results from test kits and other diagnostic methods like chest scans. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=47.08s)]
*  So how do these test kits exactly work and why are there so many problems? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=51.96s)]
*  This government lab in Singapore has produced test kits for the country's public hospitals. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=58.08s)]
*  It's also shipped about 10,000 tests to China. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=62.64s)]
*  Dr. Sydney Yee leads a team that developed them. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=65.48s)]
*  She says most doctors use a type of lab test called RT-PCR, which can be used to detect [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=68.72s)]
*  small amounts of pathogens, including viruses like HIV. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=73.72s)]
*  So this is the gold standard that's being used. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=77.36s)]
*  What it does is it actually directly detects the presence of the pathogen. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=80.68s)]
*  It's pretty easy to use. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=87.48s)]
*  A doctor collects samples from a patient by swabbing the nose or throat for mucus. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=89.04s)]
*  Those swabs are then sent to a lab for a test that detects the genetic material of a pathogen. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  The sample is first mixed with reagents in a tube, then put into a machine that duplicates [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=99.2s)]
*  the genetic material. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=104.28s)]
*  So if the virus exists, these copies will amplify its presence, confirming that a patient [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  has tested positive for the coronavirus. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  Dr. Yee says the first place for error could be at the swabbing stage. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=116.08s)]
*  Most of the time, the sampling for COVID-19 comes from throat swab. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=120.12s)]
*  COVID-19 is actually a lung infection disease, so doing the throat swab really depends on [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=124.4s)]
*  how much of the pathogen you're able to capture. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=130.68s)]
*  Another place for error is the time it takes for the sample to reach the lab. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=133.92s)]
*  The pathogen on the swab is not going to last for many, many hours, so the transportation, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=137.6s)]
*  the logistics is also important. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=143.2s)]
*  Transportation is a huge hurdle in Wuhan, where the city has been on lockdown since [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  mid-January. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=149.88s)]
*  When the sample gets to the lab, what is the infrastructure of the lab that is able to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=151.6s)]
*  deal with running tests, as well as the expertise and the experience of the lab technicians [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=156.67999999999998s)]
*  that are running these tests? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=162.83999999999997s)]
*  Dr. Yee says the most critical moment for human error is when doctors decide to use [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=165.04s)]
*  a test kit. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  For instance, many people have been showing mild symptoms, but that doesn't mean they [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=172.16s)]
*  don't have the pathogen. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=176.24s)]
*  It's very hard to make the direct correlation between what our test kit can be used on, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=178.24s)]
*  which stage of the disease progression with respect to how much the pathogen is present [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=184.44s)]
*  in the patients. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=188.88s)]
*  Just how accurately these test kits are being used is on trial in Wuhan. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=190.48s)]
*  Here, hospitals have been overstretched with limited resources. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=194.44s)]
*  There are not enough staff to swab patients, and labs are inundated with a backlog of samples [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=198.88s)]
*  that wait to be tested. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=203.32s)]
*  There are many, many different steps and different processes involved in just running a test. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=204.32s)]
*  It's not just with respect to the test kit itself. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&t=210.64s)]
