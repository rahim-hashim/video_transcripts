# Volatility Trading: The Market Tactic That’s Driving Stocks Haywire | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 25, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c)
*  Over the past few months, volatility has ruled the markets. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's the S&P 500 on Thursday, June 11, when the index fell 6% in a single day of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=6.4s)]
*  trading. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=12.0s)]
*  It was a rough day. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=13.0s)]
*  But not for everyone. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=15.0s)]
*  This chart from the same day shows the price of UVXY, a fund that's tied to market volatility. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=16.86s)]
*  You can see, as the S&P tumbled, UVXY gained. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=23.88s)]
*  This fund is a type of volatility trade, which is a kind of bet that has lately attracted [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=28.6s)]
*  more investors and critics. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  Analysts say volatility trading doesn't only benefit from market turbulence, it can [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=36.52s)]
*  actually make the swings bigger, which could make markets riskier for everyone. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=40.46s)]
*  We'll explain. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=45.16s)]
*  To understand volatility trading, a good place to start is the CBOE Volatility Index, or [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=50.24s)]
*  the VIX. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  The VIX is known as Wall Street's fear gauge, and it basically measures market volatility. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=57.36s)]
*  And it's based on options prices tied to the S&P 500. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=63.44s)]
*  The VIX tracks the price of calls and puts, which are contracts that allow investors to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=68.08s)]
*  bet on whether stocks will rise or fall. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=72.56s)]
*  When a lot of investors are expecting big swings, that demand can drive up the price [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=76.16s)]
*  of calls and puts. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=80.88s)]
*  For example, on March 16, the VIX rose by 43 percent, a huge jump that led the index [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=82.68s)]
*  to a record close. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  So on March 16, the market crashed. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=90.36000000000001s)]
*  Stocks had one of their worst days in history. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=94.2s)]
*  Investors were reaching for options contracts throughout the day, driving up the prices [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=97.5s)]
*  of those options contracts because they expected more volatility in the future. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=101.28s)]
*  And that drove the VIX up. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=105.66000000000001s)]
*  Now on that day, traders were not only betting on which way stocks would go, they were also [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=107.76s)]
*  betting on which way the VIX would go. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=112.48s)]
*  That's a type of volatility trade. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=115.68s)]
*  But there are others, too. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=117.72s)]
*  In fact, there's a whole ecosystem of trading products that allow investors to bet on how [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=119.4s)]
*  rough or calm the markets will be. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=124.08s)]
*  Experts say these bets, and the hedging traders do to cover them, could be affecting the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=127.0s)]
*  market in really big ways. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=131.2s)]
*  So volatility started out as a metric to measure the market. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=133.28s)]
*  But now we're seeing these products that trade volatility and the whole host of derivatives [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=136.8s)]
*  to trade volatility getting so big that some analysts say that they can actually influence [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=142.08s)]
*  the market and drive more volatility. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  This current stretch of market swings comes after a decade of increased interest in this [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=151.14000000000001s)]
*  type of trading. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=155.44s)]
*  Here's a look at assets and hedge funds that trade market turbulence. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=156.44s)]
*  And here are assets under management for exchange traded products tied to the VIX, like the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  UVXY. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  You can see the volatility business took off after the financial crisis and grew from there [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=168.36s)]
*  as bankers devised new and risky ways to trade it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  Both charts mark 2020 as a record high. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  It's been a crazy few months for the stock market and we've seen some of the biggest [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  swings we've ever seen in history. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  And what that's done is actually that's drawn more interest to these types of trades, the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=188.44000000000003s)]
*  volatility trades. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=194.24s)]
*  That means people are putting more money in these exchange traded products that bet on [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=195.32000000000002s)]
*  volatility. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  For some investors and hedge fund managers, the strategy has paid off. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  One investor I spoke to, his strategy is up more than 200 percent through May while the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=206.0s)]
*  S&P 500 has fallen over that time frame. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=211.12s)]
*  Remember UVXY? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  Here it is for the full year. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  And this is the spike we showed earlier. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=218.56s)]
*  UVXY has had some big gains, but not everyone has won. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=220.92s)]
*  There have also been big downward moves, leaving some investors with huge losses. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=225.55999999999997s)]
*  We saw just this year professional investors and professional hedge funds that trade volatility. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=231.27999999999997s)]
*  Some of them took some really big losses or shut down entirely. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=237.64s)]
*  Look, you know, these are really risky strategies and it's important for investors to proceed [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=241.11999999999998s)]
*  with a ton of caution because it's definitely not a guaranteed win for you to bet on market [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=246.84s)]
*  volatility. And even some of the most successful and sophisticated investors can have trouble [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=252.67999999999998s)]
*  with these trades because it can be really difficult to manage the risk associated with [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=258.44s)]
*  derivatives trading. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=263.0s)]
*  It's unclear how long this current bout of market turbulence will last, but experts agree [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=264.92s)]
*  on something. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  The more volatile market is also a riskier one. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYeDy7AE5c&t=270.88s)]
