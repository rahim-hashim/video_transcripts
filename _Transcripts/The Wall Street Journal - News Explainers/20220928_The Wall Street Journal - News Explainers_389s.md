# Can We Vaccinate Covid Like the Flu With Yearly Shots?  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0)
*  This is a COVID virus and this is the flu. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=0.0s)]
*  The two have some similarities. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=4.12s)]
*  Both are respiratory diseases, both mutate regularly, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=6.24s)]
*  and both have vaccines that can prevent serious illness. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=10.08s)]
*  And the framework for updating the COVID vaccine [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=13.48s)]
*  might look similar to the one used [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=15.8s)]
*  for the flu vaccine in the future. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  We likely are moving towards a path [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=19.56s)]
*  with a vaccination cadence similar [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=22.44s)]
*  to that of the annual influenza vaccine. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=24.88s)]
*  But there are some key differences [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=27.84s)]
*  between the viruses and the vaccines [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=29.32s)]
*  that experts say makes applying the same framework challenging. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=31.44s)]
*  And those challenges have created a debate [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=35.04s)]
*  on whether vaccinating COVID like we vaccinate the flu [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=37.28s)]
*  is actually the best way to tackle the virus. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=40.36s)]
*  Here's how the update process for the flu vaccine works. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=44.44s)]
*  The flu is the only vaccine that the CDC recommends [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=48.0s)]
*  be taken annually across the public. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=51.28s)]
*  Even if you've been naturally affected [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=53.84s)]
*  or vaccinated the year before, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=55.32s)]
*  you may well not be protected against serious illness [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=56.52s)]
*  from the new strains that then come into the country. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=59.84s)]
*  So that's why we need a yearly flu vaccine. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=62.0s)]
*  Dr. Paul Offit is a member of the FDA committee [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=64.28s)]
*  that advises the administration on which vaccines to approve [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=66.84s)]
*  and to authorize for emergency use. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=70.16s)]
*  Influenza is a single stranded RNA virus. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  Single stranded RNA virus reproduce themselves, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=76.16s)]
*  they're not terribly faithful. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=79.4s)]
*  For that reason then, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  as that genome is reproduced and reproduced and reproduced, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=82.04s)]
*  there are errors that can be incorporated. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=85.68s)]
*  Annual flu vaccines are typically trivalent or quadrivalent, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=87.84s)]
*  meaning they cover three or four different strains of the virus [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=91.68s)]
*  that can be circulating at one time. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=94.24s)]
*  Global health organizations and researchers [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=96.56s)]
*  work together twice a year to decide which strain [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=98.84s)]
*  should be included in the vaccine. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=101.48s)]
*  Since the Northern and Southern hemispheres [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=103.8s)]
*  have different flu seasons, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=105.48s)]
*  they look at which strains are already circulating [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=107.04s)]
*  in other countries to predict which ones [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=109.0s)]
*  might make their way to the other side of the globe. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=110.84s)]
*  Updated flu vaccines don't typically go through human trials [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=114.16s)]
*  for efficacy or safety [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=117.16s)]
*  before they are distributed to the public. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=118.84s)]
*  Instead, they rely on tests on human samples [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  like mucus and blood, animal testing, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  and extensive experience with the disease and vaccines. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=125.84s)]
*  We have now decades worth of correlations [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=129.24s)]
*  between if we give this vaccine [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  and it induces a certain immune response in mice or ferrets, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=133.28s)]
*  then we can take a pretty good guess as to whether or not [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=136.68s)]
*  it's going to be effective based on what's circulating. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=138.68s)]
*  And there are similarities between that process [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=141.24s)]
*  and the process for the new bivalent COVID vaccines, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=143.6s)]
*  which were authorized by the FDA in August. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=146.16s)]
*  These new vaccines were cleared for use [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  without being tested in humans [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=151.64s)]
*  or having the results from the human testing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=154.2s)]
*  Also, they target more than one strain. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=156.48s)]
*  But there are also some differences [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  because COVID is less predictable than the flu. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=161.12s)]
*  Flu season typically runs from October to March in the U.S. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=164.44s)]
*  That's when activity peaks. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=167.88s)]
*  But while COVID has had the strongest surges in winter, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=170.6s)]
*  there isn't a predictable pattern yet [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=173.12s)]
*  for when the spikes will start [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=174.76s)]
*  or when a new variant might appear. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=176.24s)]
*  Flu vaccines have also been produced for a long time [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=179.0s)]
*  and use a standardized process to target the same strains. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=181.8s)]
*  COVID vaccines don't have the same coordination [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=185.24s)]
*  mapped out yet. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=187.84s)]
*  With COVID, we've got lots of companies [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=188.96s)]
*  working on different technologies of vaccines, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  and they are testing their vaccines with different strains. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=195.24s)]
*  You know, it's sort of just, you know, a little murky [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  or a little messy there as to what the industry is doing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=202.88s)]
*  The unpredictability of the virus has made it tricky to know [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=205.68s)]
*  when the right time to boost is. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=208.72s)]
*  An FDA spokesperson said they don't know yet [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  if individuals will need to receive additional booster doses [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=213.68s)]
*  of the COVID-19 vaccine. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=216.48s)]
*  But it may be possible the annual ones will be needed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of variables that are sort of unknown right now. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=222.16s)]
*  One is that the how long the protection [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=224.88s)]
*  from these vaccines will last [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=228.44s)]
*  is one thing that's still being studied. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=230.28s)]
*  With the original COVID vaccines, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=232.56s)]
*  some studies show that neutralizing antibodies, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=234.32000000000002s)]
*  which help prevent viruses from infecting cells, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=236.8s)]
*  may start to wane after six months [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  or even sooner with newer variants. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  But vaccines also induce T cells, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=244.16000000000003s)]
*  which attack cells infected by the virus [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=246.72s)]
*  when antibodies fail. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=248.72s)]
*  Some studies show that these cells [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  might offer longer protection even after antibodies wane. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=251.96s)]
*  Some experts think annual shots [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=256.44s)]
*  are the best way to balance timing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=258.0s)]
*  Others aren't convinced yet. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=260.12s)]
*  There are experts, there are doctors out there who say, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=262.44s)]
*  hold on, maybe we need to do it more frequently. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=264.91999999999996s)]
*  Maybe we need to have a new vaccine every time. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=267.32s)]
*  We see a sort of a worrisome variant. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=270.4s)]
*  We have some who are saying, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=272.88s)]
*  one booster shot will last you for several years. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=274.28s)]
*  Maybe just the first booster will be enough for some people. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=277.28s)]
*  Some, like Dr. Offit, also say that while it's not clear [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=280.44s)]
*  if the entire population would benefit from updated boosters, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=283.44s)]
*  there's a clear benefit to some. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  This booster dose, frankly, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=288.56s)]
*  for those who are at highest risk, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  is really about the elderly, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=292.36s)]
*  people who are compromised, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=294.92s)]
*  people who have long-term heart or long kidney [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=297.04s)]
*  or neurological disease. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  But I don't think there's a downside to taking it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  I just don't think the upside is quite what it's made up today. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  Offit was in a minority that voted against [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=307.08000000000004s)]
*  including an Omicron component to updated boosters in June. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=309.24s)]
*  He says he would have liked to see more data on the vaccine [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=312.72s)]
*  and how it was administered. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=315.8s)]
*  I didn't think data were presented [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=317.32000000000005s)]
*  that were convincing that the bivalent vaccine [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=318.76000000000005s)]
*  was any better than the current vaccine. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  But other experts say that updated boosters [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=323.64000000000004s)]
*  will be a useful tool in fighting the virus moving forward. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=326.04s)]
*  Modeling projections show that an uptake [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=329.48s)]
*  of updated COVID-19 vaccine doses [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=331.72s)]
*  similar to an annual flu vaccine coverage early this fall [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=334.12s)]
*  could prevent as many as 100,000 hospitalizations, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=338.12s)]
*  9,000 deaths, and save billions of dollars [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=343.12s)]
*  in direct medical cost. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=347.12s)]
*  Medical experts will be watching the rollout [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50IdIuAWpn0&t=348.96s)]
