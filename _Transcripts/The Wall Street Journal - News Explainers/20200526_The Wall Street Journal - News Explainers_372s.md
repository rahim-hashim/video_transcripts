# With SpaceX Poised for Takeoff, Small Rocket Startups Fall Behind | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 26, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc)
*  On May 27th, SpaceX and NASA are scheduled to launch the first orbital human spaceflight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=0.0s)]
*  from U.S. soil since the space shuttle program ended in 2011. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=7.0s)]
*  Lift off, the final lift off of Atlantis on the shoulders of the space shuttle. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=10.84s)]
*  America will continue the dream. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=16.84s)]
*  And we view it as an opportunity but also a responsibility for the American people, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=19.64s)]
*  for the SpaceX team, for all of NASA. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=24.64s)]
*  But while SpaceX dominates the headlines, small launch startups face an increasingly [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=28.02s)]
*  tough trajectory, operating along slim margins with small cash flows. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=32.76s)]
*  And with funds drying up during the coronavirus pandemic, many small launchers could falter. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=38.82s)]
*  Analysts say as many as 90 percent of the 100-plus companies in the industry are likely [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  to fail. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=50.18s)]
*  If this happens, thousands of jobs could be lost and plans for new technologies and research [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=52.1s)]
*  could be delayed. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=56.940000000000005s)]
*  To understand how we got here, you have to go back to 2009, when SpaceX's Falcon 1 [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=59.46s)]
*  took off, becoming the first major private space company to successfully launch a commercial [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  satellite into orbit. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=75.38s)]
*  Investors took notice and funneled more than $20 billion into hundreds of small space companies [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=78.18s)]
*  over the next decade. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=83.22s)]
*  During the same period, demand for small satellites grew. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=86.52s)]
*  Companies like OneWeb and SpaceX's Starlink made plans to launch constellations of thousands [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=90.56s)]
*  of tiny satellites that would expand global internet access. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=95.84s)]
*  Other small satellites were developed to collect navigation data and detect forest fires from [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=101.8s)]
*  space. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=106.6s)]
*  Some could eventually provide advanced missile defense for the military. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=107.8s)]
*  So we put some weather satellites up, you know, a couple of years ago. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=111.64s)]
*  They provide weather to New Zealand. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=114.38s)]
*  A few minutes later, they provide weather to Australia, then, you know, the UK and then [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=115.7s)]
*  America. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=120.38s)]
*  And every 90 minutes, they're going around the planet providing data that influences [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=121.38s)]
*  tens of millions of people's everyday lives and decisions. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=126.3s)]
*  Large rocket launchers like SpaceX's Falcon Heavy weren't designed for small, relatively [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=130.98s)]
*  inexpensive payloads. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=136.5s)]
*  For years, the only option for small satellites to get into space was to piggyback on larger [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=138.7s)]
*  payload flights, where they got dropped off en route in orbit. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=143.98s)]
*  For many small satellite startups and programs, this isn't ideal. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=148.76s)]
*  They're reliant on the bigger payloads, which have their own orbit paths. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=152.92s)]
*  And the small satellite missions have little control over delays and scheduling. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=156.67999999999998s)]
*  For some, this could mean waiting on the shelf for over a year, which costs money. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=161.28s)]
*  If they can't afford to wait, that could mean some research programs and new technologies [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  never make it into orbit. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=170.83999999999997s)]
*  This is where small launch vehicles come in. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=173.24s)]
*  Companies like Rocket Lab and Virgin Orbit have developed lighter payload rockets that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=176.14000000000001s)]
*  can carry small satellites directly into orbit. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=180.18s)]
*  Small launch vehicle enables a customer to deliver those satellites to exactly where [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=183.62s)]
*  they want to go and exactly on the timeframe that they need. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=187.88s)]
*  Experts say these launchers have the potential to revolutionize the industry. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=191.86s)]
*  But as the pandemic continues, much of the financing these companies need to survive [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=196.70000000000002s)]
*  is drying up. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=201.32000000000002s)]
*  Some of this funding comes from government contracts. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=203.0s)]
*  In April, the Pentagon said there'd be fewer defense contracts for at least three months. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=206.36s)]
*  Domestically, we are seeing the greatest impacts in the aviation supply chain, shipbuilding [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=211.68s)]
*  and small space launch. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=217.88s)]
*  Other funding comes from venture capital. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=220.2s)]
*  To date, the vast majority of the capital raised by these small launch providers has [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=222.84s)]
*  been from financial investors with smaller pools of money coming from grants or early [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=227.5s)]
*  stage investors. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=233.66s)]
*  And the key challenge for many of these companies in a very crowded market is to continue to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=235.66s)]
*  draw additional and larger upsized rounds of capital in order to hit their development [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=241.46s)]
*  milestones. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=247.06s)]
*  This type of funding has all but stopped, and it isn't expected to flow back into the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=249.06s)]
*  small launch industry for at least the next year. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=253.5s)]
*  Experts say there are just too many of these companies for all of them to succeed in a [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=257.14000000000004s)]
*  tighter market. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=260.82000000000005s)]
*  It's so blatantly obvious that it's unsustainable to have so many small launch companies for [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=261.82000000000005s)]
*  such a small market. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=266.70000000000005s)]
*  The pandemic has really pushed the dominoes over a bit faster and the hardest point in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=267.74s)]
*  time is yet to occur. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=273.06s)]
*  Many small rocket startups also won't have access to some of the stimulus funds. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=275.32000000000005s)]
*  Most companies with more than 500 employees are ineligible for small business administration [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=280.20000000000005s)]
*  loans during the pandemic. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=285.06s)]
*  This includes some small space startups that are funded by larger venture capital firms. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=287.14s)]
*  Some industry executives and trade groups are asking for a change of rules, saying the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=292.58s)]
*  lack of access is hurting business and could lead to layoffs. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=297.14s)]
*  Although many of the companies in the space industry have a favorable exposure to government [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=301.74s)]
*  spending, which tends to be pretty secure, it's also true that they're dependent on [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=306.29999999999995s)]
*  raising new capital and the inability to capture a PPP loan could be the difference [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=311.3s)]
*  between life and death. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=317.34000000000003s)]
*  Experts say lack of funding could lead to consolidation of the sector, which could cost [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=318.90000000000003s)]
*  jobs, delay research and innovation and favor more robust established companies. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=323.14s)]
*  SpaceX is expected to continue to dominate the industry as it increases its own small [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=328.7s)]
*  satellite rideshare program and drives down launch prices. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=333.62s)]
*  Meanwhile, the smaller players are expected to suffer. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=337.7s)]
*  There will be a massive number of failures of companies that never make it across the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=341.46000000000004s)]
*  finish line. And that's simply due to the fact that there's not sufficient demand in [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=346.02000000000004s)]
*  terms of the number of launches required. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=351.42s)]
*  There's not sufficient capital to fund this many companies. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=353.78000000000003s)]
*  And quite honestly, there's not enough differentiation between the technology or the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_tkBFvaTc&t=357.18s)]
