# How an Imminent Government Shutdown Was Triggered by GOP Infighting | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY)
*  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy can't seem to catch a break. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=0.0s)]
*  15 rounds of voting before McCarthy was able to take control of the gavel. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=4.0s)]
*  Political battle over raising the debt ceiling. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=8.0s)]
*  Chaos in Congress as the government lurches towards a possible shutdown. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=10.0s)]
*  McCarthy has a razor-thin majority in the GOP-led House [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=14.0s)]
*  and is facing a looming partial government shutdown that could cost him the gavel. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=18.0s)]
*  Many Republicans think he's doing the best that anyone could do, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=22.0s)]
*  but you have a number of very hard-line Republicans who either want him out [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=25.0s)]
*  or want him to do exactly what they say, and it's going to be really hard to satisfy [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=29.0s)]
*  both of those wings with such a small majority. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=33.0s)]
*  Here's a look at the power struggle amongst House Republicans [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=36.0s)]
*  that is affecting McCarthy's control over his own party [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=39.0s)]
*  and how that could lead to a government shutdown. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=42.0s)]
*  House lawmakers are scrambling to pass a short-term spending bill by September 30, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=48.0s)]
*  the end of the fiscal year, to avoid a partial government shutdown. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=53.0s)]
*  The only problem? The majority of House Republicans can't seem to agree on what goes in that bill. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=56.0s)]
*  A faction of Republicans is threatening not to pass legislation [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=62.0s)]
*  if McCarthy doesn't include their demands in any funding deal. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=66.0s)]
*  It's a group of Republicans who are willing to basically undercut the party's legislation [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=69.0s)]
*  to make a point and to try to hold out for a better deal. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=74.0s)]
*  This group of lawmakers all agree on the need to do one thing, cut government spending. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=77.0s)]
*  But some in the group are also making other disparate demands, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=82.0s)]
*  like ending aid to Ukraine and tightening border security. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=85.0s)]
*  Some are also threatening to oust McCarthy if he doesn't meet their demands. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=89.0s)]
*  Members of the Freedom Caucus are very hard-line members who want to sharply cut government spending. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=94.0s)]
*  But then there's other folks like Matt Gaetz, who's not a member of the Freedom Caucus, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=99.0s)]
*  but is a very, very outspoken critic of McCarthy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=102.0s)]
*  He's got a whole list of demands and things he wants McCarthy to do, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=105.0s)]
*  but at the end of the day, he really just doesn't want McCarthy as speaker. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=108.0s)]
*  The path forward for the House of Representatives is to either bring you into immediate, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=113.0s)]
*  total compliance or remove you, pursuant to a motion to vacate the chair. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=118.0s)]
*  This isn't the first time McCarthy has gone head-to-head with Gaetz and other hard-line House Republicans. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=125.0s)]
*  A speaker has not been elected. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=131.0s)]
*  A speaker has not been elected. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=133.0s)]
*  Back in January, McCarthy struggled to obtain the majority of votes needed to become speaker, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=135.0s)]
*  enduring 15 rounds of voting before he won the seat. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=139.0s)]
*  Gaetz and several other Republicans led that opposition, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=145.0s)]
*  and to win them over, McCarthy made several concessions, like promising deep spending cuts. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=149.0s)]
*  The problem is that every time he gets one thing done, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=155.0s)]
*  he makes promises to some members about doing future things, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=158.0s)]
*  or to win them over, and at some point all those promises start to come due. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=162.0s)]
*  McCarthy's plight is an unfamiliar territory. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=167.0s)]
*  John Boehner. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=172.0s)]
*  Speaker John Boehner resigned in 2015 after being squeezed by clashing factions [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=174.0s)]
*  within his own party over spending cuts needed to avoid a government shutdown. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=178.0s)]
*  Republican House speakers have a long history of having a lot of dissidents [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=183.0s)]
*  who nip at their heels for years and years, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=186.0s)]
*  and try to push them on issues, including deficits, debts, and spending. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=188.0s)]
*  What is new is that his majority is so small that he cannot just ignore people. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=192.0s)]
*  He has to actually deal with them in order to get legislation passed. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=196.0s)]
*  Past speakers could probably ignore 10 or 15 or 20 members [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=199.0s)]
*  and still get bills over the finish line. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=202.0s)]
*  McCarthy cannot. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=204.0s)]
*  To pass the short-term spending bill, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=206.0s)]
*  McCarthy can't afford to lose more than four votes without help from Democrats. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=208.0s)]
*  Let's make sure the government stays open while we finish doing our job, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=213.0s)]
*  passing all the individual bills and getting this done. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=217.0s)]
*  McCarthy is a very personable leader. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=220.0s)]
*  He likes having relationships. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=222.0s)]
*  He's not so much a policy guy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=223.0s)]
*  So it really is a matter of managing his caucus, getting a bill they can pass. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=226.0s)]
*  The Republican-controlled House and the Democrat-controlled Senate [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=229.0s)]
*  will also have to negotiate a full-year spending agreement. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=232.0s)]
*  You know, I'm not a fan of spending. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=235.0s)]
*  I've seen a few of them over the years. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=239.0s)]
*  They never have produced a policy change, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=242.0s)]
*  and they've always been a loser for Republicans. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=245.0s)]
*  Shut down or not, the slim majority and political infighting in the House [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=249.0s)]
*  aren't going to go away for McCarthy. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=253.0s)]
*  There's still the limit question of if not McCarthy, then who? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=255.0s)]
*  His number two, Steve Scalise, is undergoing cancer treatments. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=257.0s)]
*  There's other Republicans who could think that he's going to be able to do that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=261.0s)]
*  There's other Republicans who could theoretically lead the caucus, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=265.0s)]
*  but it's not clear that any of them would be in a better position to do it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=268.0s)]
*  For McCarthy, it's just another example of where he's in this crazy situation [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=272.0s)]
*  and looking for a Houdini-like trick to wiggle his way out, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=276.0s)]
*  and it's just not clear how he's going to do that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1-73XyEWY&t=280.0s)]
