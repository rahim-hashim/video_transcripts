# How Ant's Plans for a $34 Billion IPO Unraveled  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 05, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA)
*  China's fintech giant Amp Group was on pace to break IPO records and on track to raise [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=0.0s)]
*  more than $34bn. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=6.44s)]
*  Ahead of the blockbuster listings in Hong Kong and Shanghai, the company's charismatic [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  co-founder Jack Ma spoke at a public forum about how China's financial system should [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=13.48s)]
*  be best regulated. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=18.52s)]
*  We cannot manage the railway station in a way that can't manage the airport. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=19.52s)]
*  We cannot manage the future in a way that can't manage yesterday. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=24.52s)]
*  In a dramatic turnaround, Chinese regulators brought the IPO plans to a halt, casting doubt [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=28.12s)]
*  over the future of Amp. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=33.4s)]
*  So how did plans for what would have been the world's biggest IPO come screeching to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=35.32s)]
*  a halt? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=39.68s)]
*  Amp has revolutionised digital finance in China. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=43.56s)]
*  There is nothing quite like it in Western financial circles. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=47.0s)]
*  For China's leadership, it is a source of great pride that you have these big, powerful [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=50.0s)]
*  tech companies like Amp. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=54.84s)]
*  It handles more than $17tr a year in payments. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=56.6s)]
*  It really is one of the backbones of the e-commerce industry. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=60.64s)]
*  Many people save and invest through Amp and they also use it to borrow money as well. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=63.92s)]
*  It has kind of stepped in and assumed this important position between banks and their [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=69.2s)]
*  end customers, where it has this nice business of kind of organising loans, whereas the banks [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=73.64s)]
*  bear most of the credit risk. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=79.72s)]
*  Amp has come under increasing regulatory scrutiny, partly because of its sheer size. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=82.52s)]
*  Some of the biggest potential problems for Amp centre on its loan business. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=88.84s)]
*  Draft rules covering lending done by businesses other than banks effectively require the company [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=93.32s)]
*  to put more of its own skin in the game. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=99.84s)]
*  Now it needs perhaps to put as much as 30% of the capital up itself. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=102.52s)]
*  Recently Amp's co-founder Jack Ma has made a rather provocative speech where he talked [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=108.08s)]
*  about how he thought the financial system in China should be overseen. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=112.64s)]
*  And that perhaps was rather unwelcome in the highest circles of the Chinese leadership. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=123.52s)]
*  We don't know precisely why regulators decided to suspend the IPO, but we know that there [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=129.84s)]
*  was a meeting between top Amp executives Jack Ma and four of China's major financial [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=134.48s)]
*  regulators and a day later the stock exchange said that actually this couldn't go ahead [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=140.16s)]
*  for now. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  It seems to some observers that this is partly also a way of letting Amp's top leaders and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=146.56s)]
*  controlling shareholders Jack Ma know that they shouldn't get too big for their britches [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  in a way, that they shouldn't presume to know what's best for China's financial system [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=155.76s)]
*  or what kind of regulation works best in the country where the government likes to keep [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=159.76s)]
*  very tight control on things in almost every industry. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=163.8s)]
*  The reaction in the markets basically was one of shocks. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=169.16000000000003s)]
*  Shares in Alibaba, which owns part of Amp, fell. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=172.56s)]
*  Shares in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell because it was due to see a boost in trading [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  volumes after Amp went public. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  Amp apologised to investors for any trouble caused and said it would embrace regulations. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=183.24s)]
*  It has outlined how it will refund individual investors in Hong Kong. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=188.68s)]
*  Regulators in mainland China are still waiting for details on how they will get their money [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=192.96s)]
*  back. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  Amp has to go back and think about what it needs to redo in order to win the approval [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  of these all-powerful Chinese regulators to go public. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCpCst4tdTA&t=202.56s)]
