Video Description: The Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2020, a key shift in its fight against inflation as concerns center around the labor market. While prices have cooled, an uptick in unemployment has reignited warnings of a recession. Regardless of the Fed’s decision about rate cuts, a lot remains at stake for the economy and Fed Chair Jerome Powell in the months ahead. 

WSJ's Nick Timiraos explains why this is the Fed's make-or-break moment.

# The Fed Rate Cut Is Here Why Now Is a Make-or-Break Moment  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng)
*  The Federal Reserve has been climbing a mountain to combat stubborn inflation so fast that it raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 16 months. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=0.0s)]
*  Then left it unchanged for more than a year. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  But now the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by a half percentage point. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=13.48s)]
*  Now is a make or break moment for the Fed. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=19.28s)]
*  While prices have cooled, an uptick in unemployment has reignited warnings of a recession, recession, a recession. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=21.72s)]
*  And so the question now is, can they stick the landing? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=29.28s)]
*  The central bank likes to keep inflation around 2 percent. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=32.56s)]
*  That became a problem in the aftermath of the pandemic. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=36.28s)]
*  Prices grew well above the 2 percent mark, eventually surpassing 7 percent in 2022. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=39.64s)]
*  For the last two years, inflation was the big emergency that was occupying all of the Fed's attention. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=46.36s)]
*  When the Fed was raising interest rates, they thought the economy was going to have to slow down a lot more than it has. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=58.44s)]
*  There isn't. And this is the best we can do. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=63.8s)]
*  And what's happened is the economy's done pretty well and inflation's come down anyway. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=67.24s)]
*  By July, the Fed managed to bring inflation closer to 2.5 percent. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=72.36s)]
*  And with prices easing, economists have turned their attention toward troubling signs in the labor market. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=77.44s)]
*  The U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs in August, a slight rebound from the summer's slump in hiring, but a notable decline from a year ago. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  The cooling in labor market conditions is unmistakable. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  It's harder to stop a rise in the unemployment rate once demand for workers has cooled. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=97.84s)]
*  I mean, what you're seeing right now is businesses saying we just don't need workers the way we did a couple of years ago. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=103.8s)]
*  The Fed can try to avoid further erosion by cutting the federal funds rate or the rate that commercial banks pay when they borrow from each other. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=110.76s)]
*  Those cuts in turn can lead to reduce rates on loans, meaning lower borrowing costs for consumers in the form of mortgages, car loans and credit cards. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=119.08000000000001s)]
*  They can also create an incentive for businesses to invest in expansion and hiring. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=128.8s)]
*  The Fed can cut interest rates for two reasons. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=133.68s)]
*  One would be you're actually trying to stimulate the economy. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=135.88s)]
*  You could also cut interest rates, including in the current situation, just because they don't need to be as high as they've been. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=139.04s)]
*  You don't need to slow down the economy as much as you had over the past year or two when inflation was much higher. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  Back to the mountain that the Fed spent the last two years climbing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=152.48s)]
*  Starting from historically low interest rates near zero in early 2022, the central bank eventually hiked to rates between 5.25 percent and 5.5 percent by July 2023. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  And stayed there. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=167.96s)]
*  Now they're coming down the mountain, but nobody really knows where base camp is going to be. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  How far down are you going to go and how fast should you get there? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=174.08s)]
*  Fed officials have largely agreed on the path forward since June 2022. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  But in recent months, two routes down to base camp have emerged. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  Earlier this year, you heard a lot of people saying, look, this economy is doing all right. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=186.84s)]
*  The economy is adding jobs. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=191.8s)]
*  The unemployment rate is at a historically low level. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=193.28s)]
*  Why rush this? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=196.12s)]
*  You have a Fed Governor, Mickey Bowman, the Kansas City Fed President, Jeff Schmidt, saying, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  I still believe quite strongly that we really need to trend this inflation number towards two. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=202.84s)]
*  It has to be sustainable. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  The danger is that if the labor market starts to weaken a little bit more, it could weaken a lot more. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=209.76s)]
*  And then you're having to cut more aggressively. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=214.68s)]
*  The other camp argues more aggressive rate cuts could preempt a serious decline in employment. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=216.92s)]
*  Now that you have a labor market slowing down, these people are saying, let's get ahead of this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=222.92s)]
*  Let's not have a recession that isn't necessary to finish the job on inflation. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=226.88s)]
*  There have been a number of Fed officials, the Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=232.04s)]
*  the Chicago Fed President Austin Goolsbee, who have been more insistent in saying, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=235.12s)]
*  We've got to keep our eye on the employment side of the mandate now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  This is what the path down to 2% inflation looks like. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=243.0s)]
*  The danger, of course, of going too fast is, well, what if some new shock hits the economy [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=248.0s)]
*  and inflation kicks back up? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  That would be very destabilizing to have interest rates go back up for the Fed to say, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=253.96s)]
*  Whoops, we cut too much. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=258.36s)]
*  We need to start climbing this mountain again. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  The Fed announced at its September meeting that it would cut rates by 50 basis points, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  starting on a faster path down the mountain. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=267.32s)]
*  We thought about what to do and we concluded that this was the right thing for the economy, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=270.32s)]
*  for the people that we serve. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=275.24s)]
*  And that's how we made our decision. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=276.32s)]
*  A 50 basis point interest rate cut signals more urgency here. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=278.44s)]
*  They raised rates a lot and they raised rates in large increments on the way up. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=281.72s)]
*  And so now that inflation seems like it's under control, but there are more risks of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=285.96s)]
*  a bigger slowdown in the job market than they want, they're going to take back some of those [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=290.0s)]
*  interest rate cuts more rapidly too. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=294.2s)]
*  I think you can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=296.36s)]
*  And so there'll be big questions now around, well, do you expect to do this again in November [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=300.44s)]
*  and in December and early next year? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=304.56s)]
*  How fast do you think you're going to take back the interest rate increases that you [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=306.4s)]
*  made in 22 and 23? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=310.24s)]
*  As the Fed charts its way forward, a lot remains at stake for the economy and Powell in the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=313.44s)]
*  months ahead. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  It would put Powell on the Mount Rushmore of central bankers if he can stick the landing. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=319.96s)]
*  Is the economy just going through a soft patch or is it falling into the recession that has [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=324.68s)]
*  been long predicted by many economists? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  The next six months could be pivotal to determining which of those we're seeing unfold here. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYPIr9oKng&t=332.03999999999996s)]
