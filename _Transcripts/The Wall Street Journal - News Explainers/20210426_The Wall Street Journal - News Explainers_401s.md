# Ant, Alibaba Show How China Reins in Big Tech Faster Than Other Countries | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo)
*  Tech companies do way more than tech these days. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=0.0s)]
*  They're now an indispensable part of our everyday lives. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=4.0s)]
*  From how we communicate to how we shop and pay for things. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=7.2s)]
*  Many have grown quickly in less than two decades, and that's especially true in China. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=10.8s)]
*  Alibaba is the biggest e-commerce company in the country by most measures, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=15.44s)]
*  and runs a system called Alipay, which is this phenomenally important payment platform. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=20.64s)]
*  Last year, more than 700 million people used Alibaba's platforms to buy things online. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=26.24s)]
*  And more than a billion people used the fintech giant Ant Group's mobile app [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  to make payments, borrow money, buy insurance and invest. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=35.12s)]
*  We're just a press, bye. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=38.48s)]
*  Alibaba was founded by Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, and he's Ant's controlling shareholder. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  The two companies helped steer the country into the digital marketplace, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=46.16s)]
*  and pushed it to become an increasingly cashless society. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=49.76s)]
*  Their impact on the economy has drawn the attention of Chinese regulators, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=53.6s)]
*  who like their counterparts in the US, have been trying to rein in big tech. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=57.52s)]
*  There isn't much really that governments in Washington and Beijing can all agree on, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=61.28s)]
*  but at the moment, push is underway to curb the power of the world's biggest tech giants. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=66.08s)]
*  China appears to be moving on a faster timeframe for much of this than the US. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=71.92s)]
*  Here's how China was able to bring Jack Ma's companies in line in just a few months. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=76.48s)]
*  The main driver of why China can move fast is because of its political system. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=80.64s)]
*  China is a highly centralized one-party state. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=84.64s)]
*  And so that means in turn that when the Chinese authorities do decide to do something, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  they can sometimes move much faster. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  And that type of speed when it comes to regulatory action was on full display with Alibaba and Ant. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  It all started with this speech by Jack Ma in October of last year. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=105.28s)]
*  In this speech, Jack Ma effectively criticized the people who were responsible for overseeing [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=108.8s)]
*  the Chinese economy and for overseeing his companies. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=114.08s)]
*  And as the Wall Street Journal has reported, that infuriated China's top leaders. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=125.12s)]
*  And in fact, President Xi Jinping himself made the decision to take the lead in the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=130.24s)]
*  The President Xi Jinping himself made the decision, my colleagues have reported, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=135.52s)]
*  to scupper the pending IPO of Ant as a result partly of the speech. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=140.16s)]
*  Ant was supposed to list on Thursday and not anymore. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=146.24s)]
*  What would have been the world's largest IPO was called off less than two weeks after that speech. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=150.8s)]
*  That kind of direct intervention by a national level leader in what is effectively a kind of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=155.68s)]
*  commercial process. It's not like you would necessarily see something equivalent happening in the U.S. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=162.0s)]
*  About two months later, Chinese regulators came down hard on Ma's two companies. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=168.72s)]
*  They criticized Ant's behavior toward consumers and rivals and told it to refocus on its payments [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=173.6s)]
*  business and fix problems in newer ventures. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=178.72s)]
*  Regulators also launched an antitrust investigation into Alibaba, saying the company abused its [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=181.36s)]
*  dominant market position, forcing some sellers to operate only on its platforms. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=186.72s)]
*  Alibaba didn't comment on the allegations, while Ant said it appreciated the guidance. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=191.36s)]
*  That probe lasted less than four months, and Alibaba was hit with a $2.8 billion antitrust fine, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=196.8s)]
*  while Ant will soon be directly overseen by China's central bank. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=203.04s)]
*  So from Ma's speech to penalties, regulators made it all happen in under six months. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=206.8s)]
*  In the U.S., you might expect some of these things to last many years. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  Just take a look at four American big tech giants that have been accused of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  anti-competitive behavior in the digital marketplace. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=219.28s)]
*  The testimony you are out to give is true and correct to the best of your knowledge, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=222.0s)]
*  information and belief. So help you God. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=225.76s)]
*  While the usually visible Jack Ma disappeared after the IPO was scrapped, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=228.24s)]
*  in the U.S., the CEOs were called to a very public hearing in front of House lawmakers. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=232.32s)]
*  You had four of the most powerful technology executives in the world subject to hours of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=237.36s)]
*  hostile questioning, which came from both sides of the aisle. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=243.04s)]
*  This hearing came amid a congressional fact-finding investigation that had been [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=246.4s)]
*  underway for more than a year. Remember, Chinese regulators' [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=250.24s)]
*  antitrust investigation into Alibaba from start to finish took about four months. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=253.68s)]
*  At the end of the House Democrats' 16-month probe, lawmakers concluded that the four companies had [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=259.12s)]
*  leveraged their dominance to stamp out competition and stifle innovation. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=264.16s)]
*  Republicans said they supported strong antitrust enforcement targeting the companies. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=268.32s)]
*  The four companies disputed the findings. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  Since then, there have been a series of blockbuster lawsuits launched by U.S. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=275.52s)]
*  federal agencies and state governments aimed at enforcing existing antitrust rules. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  But as of April, U.S. regulators and lawmakers haven't ordered these companies to reform their [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=283.84s)]
*  business practices. The U.S. is, of course, a democracy with all of the checks and balances [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=288.96s)]
*  and requirements for transparency that that involves. And that means that companies can push [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=293.84s)]
*  back. For example, the popular Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=299.44s)]
*  We're looking at TikTok. We may be banning TikTok. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=303.52s)]
*  In August last year, the Trump administration signed an executive order that could effectively [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=306.56s)]
*  ban Americans from using and downloading the app. This was over concerns that user data could be [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=310.96s)]
*  shared with the Chinese government. TikTok said that the Chinese government has never asked for [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=315.84s)]
*  user data and would refuse such a request. Within the U.S. legal system, the company fought back. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=320.4s)]
*  TikTok filed lawsuits against the order and less than two months later, a federal judge blocked the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=326.48s)]
*  administration's ban. But for Jack Ma and his companies, there was no room for appeal. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=331.36s)]
*  Chinese political context, basically it makes it much harder for companies [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=336.24s)]
*  or others to push back if they disagree. Alibaba immediately accepted the fine and said it would [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=340.64s)]
*  invest in measures to support merchants on its platforms, while Ant said it would maintain the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=346.48s)]
*  continuity and quality of its services while it fully complies with regulations. This regulatory [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=351.04s)]
*  assault has also gone beyond Jack Ma's companies. A few days later, nearly three dozen other big [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  tech companies in China also vowed to comply with the country's anti-monopoly regulations. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=362.4s)]
*  So while these two companies have been shining examples of Chinese innovation, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=367.76s)]
*  from Beijing's perspective, their success needs to align with the party's interests. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=371.84s)]
*  If there was a sense in which it was allowing the private sector to command bits of the economy, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=376.47999999999996s)]
*  it is now kind of pushing Alibaba and other companies to fall more tightly in line with [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=382.88000000000005s)]
*  its own priorities. It's about kind of making sure that government control or party control [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  over the Chinese economy is secure. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9RoFvPW7oo&t=395.44000000000005s)]
