# What One Winemaker's Pricing Decisions Tell Us About Inflation | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 27, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4)
*  Naturally, in the wine industry, we have good years, we have bad years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=0.0s)]
*  Last year we had the fires, major fires here in California, in Napa Valley. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=12.0s)]
*  And then this is the second year of drought. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=17.06s)]
*  So it's been rough just from that aspect. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=19.02s)]
*  It is certainly difficult times. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=21.36s)]
*  Not only we have labor shortages, but at the same time, there's scarcity of supply and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=24.36s)]
*  there is an abundance of demand. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=29.92s)]
*  Business owners like winemaker Malik Amrani are facing three main pressures on how they [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=33.32s)]
*  price their products. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=37.82s)]
*  High demand, rising costs of labor, and rising costs of supplies. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=39.52s)]
*  Whether Amrani and others like him absorb these costs or pass them on to consumers determines [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=44.2s)]
*  the course of inflation in the U.S. economy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=49.0s)]
*  The U.S. economy is made up of literally hundreds of millions of individual workers, businesses, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=51.96s)]
*  and employers. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=58.0s)]
*  And inflation is really the output of what all those hundreds of millions of people simultaneously [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=59.0s)]
*  are deciding in the transactions with each other and their own decisions. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=64.36s)]
*  These decisions have big consequences for business owners. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=71.2s)]
*  Eating the rising costs they're facing could destroy their profit margin, but passing them [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=74.72s)]
*  on could drive customers away. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=78.84s)]
*  So this is the equivalence of a glass of wine. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=81.78s)]
*  The Weiss wine is a mid-size Napa Valley winery. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=86.04s)]
*  We produce about 25,000 cases a year. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=89.22000000000001s)]
*  Typically, we are a little bit under what the typical price point for Napa Valley wine [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=91.84s)]
*  will be. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  The house tier, we are between $22 and $33. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  For our single vineyard reserve tier, that starts at $38 and it goes all the way up to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=104.12s)]
*  $69. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  Like many businesses right now, Amrani says he's experiencing strong demand for his product. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=111.84s)]
*  But he's facing a lot of obstacles to meet that demand. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=118.2s)]
*  We are in a perfect storm where kind of all the elements, things that we never had to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=123.16s)]
*  worry about, are becoming really difficult to source. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=127.68s)]
*  It's been very hard to source labor since the start of the pandemic. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=133.68s)]
*  It's kind of getting harder this year. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=140.2s)]
*  The $15 minimum wage really kind of doesn't apply to Napa because we've been paying here [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=142.32s)]
*  $20 to $22 pre-pandemic. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=147.64s)]
*  And now since we can't find labor, we are in the upper 20s to lower 30s just for basic [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=150.92s)]
*  vineyard labor or cellar labor. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=157.16s)]
*  Glass has been particularly difficult to source. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=164.83999999999997s)]
*  I will say generic glass mold that used to take me a text message, maybe a phone call [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=167.08s)]
*  or an email to order, now takes me 20 to 40 hours on average to find. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=171.88s)]
*  I have so many of them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  One is glass suppliers. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=180.12s)]
*  It's like you've got to be talking to 12 people all the freaking time. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=182.12s)]
*  Thank you for calling West Coast Bottles. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=190.84s)]
*  How are you? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=192.44s)]
*  Hey, I'm good, Cynthia. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=193.44s)]
*  How have you been? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=194.44s)]
*  What is it like? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=195.44s)]
*  I don't have any good news for you today. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=196.56s)]
*  Oh, shoot. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=198.56s)]
*  How much are you selling this wine for? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=199.56s)]
*  You know, for the cab, we're $29, $29. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=203.44s)]
*  And then when I do find the glass, after spending a long time looking for it, then I'm paying [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=207.8s)]
*  30 to 50% more. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=214.0s)]
*  Bringing a container out of China of glass a year ago would be somewhere around $3,000 [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  to $4,000. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=222.76s)]
*  Today we're north of $12,000 to $15,000. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  She wouldn't even tell me the price on the phone. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  That's how bad it is. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=231.56s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if she doubles the price. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  She's saying it's all because of the shipping. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  Even cardboard is being hard to source. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=241.44s)]
*  I didn't expect that the cardboard would be an issue. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=243.32s)]
*  Especially generic craft cardboard that doesn't have anything printed on it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=246.0s)]
*  The prices dramatically went up. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=249.28s)]
*  No less than 50% in some instances. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=251.8s)]
*  The only thing that may help ease the difficulties on the supply chain is lower demand. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=255.08s)]
*  And I really don't see the demand slowing down anytime soon. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=262.4s)]
*  So we know that a big part of the inflation process is psychological. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=265.64s)]
*  Inflation will partly depend on what people think it will be. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=270.32s)]
*  So think of the business that's facing an increase in its costs. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=275.4s)]
*  He can either decide, alright, these higher costs are here to stay and I'm going to raise [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  the price for my customers. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=284.44s)]
*  Or he can decide, you know, I've got a pretty good sense of this is a temporary disruption [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=286.23999999999995s)]
*  and those costs are going back a year from now. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  If I raise my prices now, I'm going to lose market share and it'll be for nothing because [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=292.32s)]
*  those costs will go down a year from now. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=296.84s)]
*  So he's got to make that call. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=299.28s)]
*  We're absolutely trying to swallow the cost and just deal with it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=302.64s)]
*  But because it's not a 5% or 2% or 10% inflation, in many cases it's 40% up, it will certainly [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=308.12s)]
*  have consequences when it comes to price increases. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=316.88s)]
*  Our brand was born on the idea of making Napa Valley accessible for that everyday occasion. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  If we are forced to raise the prices in the house here, it's almost like we're in a different [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  territory appealing to a different consumer. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=334.12s)]
*  A lot of our fans at the Weiss wine, I can see them remaining loyal to us. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=337.2s)]
*  But for others, they may just not be able to afford that price increase and they may [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=341.88s)]
*  look at other regions besides Napa Valley, maybe go to a different wine region or even [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  international wines versus the local wines. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hivHztWxEj4&t=351.2s)]
