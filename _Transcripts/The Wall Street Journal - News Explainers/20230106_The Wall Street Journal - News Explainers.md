Video Description: Tesla closed its worst year in its stock’s history, shedding about $675 billion in market valuation in 2022—the same year CEO Elon Musk bought Twitter. But reasons for the selloff go well beyond the social media company. WSJ’s Sean McLain explains.

# Tesla Stock’s Worst Year Ever, Explained  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q)
*  When billionaire Elon Musk bought Twitter, some Tesla investors worried Musk was abandoning the electric vehicle maker to focus on the social media company. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=0.0s)]
*  So in Twitter... [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=8.92s)]
*  What could possibly go wrong? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=10.92s)]
*  Since the deals closed in late October, Tesla shares have slipped, ending the year down 65 percent, the company's worst year on record. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=13.92s)]
*  But the reason for the sell-off goes far beyond Twitter. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=21.6s)]
*  Here's what drove Tesla investors away in 2022 and what's affecting the carmaker going into 2023. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=24.88s)]
*  Let's start with demand. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=31.24s)]
*  For years, Tesla has stood out as the leader in the electric vehicle space. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=33.32s)]
*  And while its dominance continued in the third quarter of 2022, its market share slipped to 61 percent. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=37.32s)]
*  In the last year, we've seen an explosion of competing EV models for Tesla. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=43.56s)]
*  And as that number continues to grow over the years, the concern is whether or not demand for Tesla vehicles will continue to stay as high as it has been in the past. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=49.96s)]
*  According to JD Power, there were 33 EV models available in the U.S. at the end of 2021. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=58.48s)]
*  But by the end of 2022, that number had jumped to 53 models. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=64.4s)]
*  Tesla still held four of the top five selling EVs last year, according to S&P Global Mobility. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=69.28s)]
*  But the sell-off in Tesla shares reflects investors' fear that its hold won't last as newer models arrive. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=75.08s)]
*  Tesla has sold the same sort of handful of models for years now. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  And the question is, will Tesla continue to be as competitive as it has in the past or will they become outdated? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=85.84s)]
*  Further fueling concerns are customer wait times for Tesla cars, which dropped sharply over 2022. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=92.0s)]
*  Some investors see this as a sign demand is already softening. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=98.28s)]
*  Musk addressed these concerns on Tesla's third quarter earnings call. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=102.44000000000001s)]
*  I can't emphasize enough. We have excellent demand for Q4 and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into the future as we can see. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  And in December, the CEO said on a Twitter space's call that near-term demand pressures were driven by rising interest rate policies. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=118.2s)]
*  Production disruptions also contributed to the stock slide last year, leading to Tesla missing its full year vehicle delivery target. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=126.04s)]
*  The EV maker said it delivered 1.3 million vehicles in 2022, up 40 percent from 2021. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=133.76s)]
*  That was shy of its goal of increasing deliveries by 50 percent or more. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=140.16s)]
*  It would have needed more than 1.4 million to hit that target. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=143.68s)]
*  News of the shortfall pushed stocks down another 12 percent to start the new year, its largest single day decline in more than two years. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=147.52s)]
*  Intermittent factory closures at Tesla's China plant, its largest by volume, were one part of the problem. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=155.6s)]
*  China's zero COVID policy led to a number of shutdowns at its factory in Shanghai, which obviously created supply issues of its own. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=161.16s)]
*  Tesla also faced issues at new factories in Texas and Germany, where it struggled to ramp up production. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  Musk addressed those problems in a May interview. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=173.84s)]
*  Both Berlin and Austin factories are gigantic money furnaces right now. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=176.44s)]
*  Rising supplier and logistics costs, combined with soaring inflation, contributed to these production setbacks. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=182.68s)]
*  Tesla and every manufacturer making EVs today is confronting rapidly rising costs from the raw materials that go into the batteries to construction related costs, or frankly, even labor related costs. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=188.48s)]
*  All of that is going up and the car industry is not one with huge profit margins. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=200.52s)]
*  For Tesla, this included spending roughly 11 billion dollars in the first quarter on items needed to make and sell cars. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=206.72s)]
*  Overwhelmingly, our concern is how do we keep the factories operating so we can pay people and not go bankrupt? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=213.32s)]
*  Overvaluation is another factor some investors and analysts say is complicating Tesla's shrinking stock price. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=221.12s)]
*  Tesla has been egregiously overvalued for the last couple of years based on shite. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=227.76s)]
*  At its peak, Tesla was worth more than the 10 largest automakers on the planet combined, despite having just a fraction of their sales. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=233.2s)]
*  A lot of investors who have debated whether or not Tesla is an overvalued company have done so based on the fact that it owned a huge percentage of the US EV market and that it was the first mover in that market. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=240.68s)]
*  Its valuation was driven in part by its CEO, and some investors say Musk's promises about future vehicles have pushed shares higher, though many of the cars didn't come until years later. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=255.28s)]
*  The latest example, Tesla's Cybertruck, which was first unveiled three years ago and still hasn't hit the market. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=266.12s)]
*  Cybertruck is going to be awesome. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=272.4s)]
*  It's worth the wait, believe me. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=273.84s)]
*  And more directly, Musk's move to offload billions in Tesla stock, in part related to Twitter, has pushed down Tesla's share price. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=276.03999999999996s)]
*  Anytime anybody sells $40 billion with a company's stock, it's going to bring that stock price down. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=283.96s)]
*  What isn't clear is how that specific action is influencing other investors. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=289.23999999999995s)]
*  Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  Tesla's stock sell-off comes as investors across the market prepare for what some see as an oncoming recession. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=297.96s)]
*  A downturn could slow car buying, especially for pricier vehicles. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=303.84s)]
*  Will those people who might otherwise in 2022 or 2021 purchase a $60,000 vehicle? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=308.16s)]
*  Will they instead purchase a $40,000 gas powered vehicle? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  On Tesla's third quarter earnings call, Musk said that he sees the EV company as recession resilient. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=319.12s)]
*  Let's say 2023 is a brutal recession year. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=324.64000000000004s)]
*  Even then, we generate meaningful cash. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=328.56s)]
*  Tesla investors are now waiting for later this month when the carmaker will report its full year earnings. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=332.12s)]
*  Which could give a glimpse of the stock's prospects for the coming year. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZvBB1HVe4Q&t=337.32s)]
