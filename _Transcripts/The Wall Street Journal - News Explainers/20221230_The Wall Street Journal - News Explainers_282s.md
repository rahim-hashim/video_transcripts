# How Trump’s Taxes Became Public — And What They Reveal | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY)
*  After more than seven years of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=0.0s)]
*  When are you going to release your tax returns? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=2.3000000000000003s)]
*  Probably over the next few months. They're being worked on right now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=4.0600000000000005s)]
*  Well, I'm not releasing the tax returns because as you know they're under audit. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=6.96s)]
*  and a long legal and political battle that eventually led to the Supreme Court, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=9.9s)]
*  former President Donald Trump's tax returns have been released. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=14.5s)]
*  And the documents raise more questions about the former president's taxes [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  and how the IRS handled them. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=21.86s)]
*  Here's what we know and don't know about Trump's finances [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  and why the returns were finally released. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=27.7s)]
*  First, the numbers. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=31.0s)]
*  Through 2015 and 2020, the six years that were made public, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=32.76s)]
*  the joint returns show that Donald and Melania Trump's reported income varied widely. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=36.66s)]
*  For several years, it was negative tens of millions, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=41.96s)]
*  and then positive, then negative again. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=44.86s)]
*  For someone who's got business income flowing into their individual tax return, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=47.46s)]
*  it just doesn't look like a wager nurse tax return. It's different. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=51.66s)]
*  It is normal for businesses, whether it's real estate business, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=55.1s)]
*  which particularly tends to have a lot of deductions, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=58.6s)]
*  or just a regular business that will have up years and down years, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=60.7s)]
*  will go up and down with the business cycle. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=63.64s)]
*  The amount of income taxes paid varied widely too. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  For two of the years that they were in the red, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=69.3s)]
*  the Trumps only paid $750 in income taxes. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=71.3s)]
*  In another year, they paid zero. But this was expected. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=75.5s)]
*  You're going to be surprised at how little I paid. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=79.14s)]
*  He didn't pay any federal income tax. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=80.9s)]
*  So if he's paid... [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=83.3s)]
*  Yes, he was not paying taxes because he had losses that he claimed, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=84.96s)]
*  but there's key questions about whether those losses were legitimate and legal, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=88.96s)]
*  and those are some of the things the IRS is looking at. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=94.1s)]
*  Another thing the IRS is looking at, millions in tax credits. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=96.1s)]
*  The nonpartisan committee that released them specifically wants the IRS [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  to look into foreign credits, like this one while Trump was in office. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=103.86s)]
*  The committee also flagged Trump's reported loans given to his children, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=108.56s)]
*  and mentioned whether they could have been potential gifts, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=111.76s)]
*  which should have been taxed differently. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=114.56s)]
*  Other questions rose around large charitable contributions before his presidency. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=116.7s)]
*  But these are all questions and not answers, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=121.0s)]
*  because the IRS hasn't finished its audits. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  The weird thing is we have this snapshot moment [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  where we have some information about him, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  but then things are going to change. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=130.22s)]
*  The committee's report raised questions not just for the continuing audit, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=131.86s)]
*  but around the entire process. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=135.72s)]
*  It's IRS policy for the president and vice president to be audited, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=137.9s)]
*  it happens to every administration, at least since the 1970s. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=141.72s)]
*  Because people have got to know whether or not their president's a crook. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=145.72s)]
*  Well, I'm not a crook. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=149.68s)]
*  It's like a check on the executive branch itself, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=150.88s)]
*  on someone who's above the IRS. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=154.42s)]
*  There's no formal process, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=157.88s)]
*  but audits are generally done soon after the returns are submitted. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=159.38s)]
*  So in theory, the audit for Trump's 2016 return [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=162.86s)]
*  should have started in 2017 while he was president. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=165.52s)]
*  2017's in 2018, you get it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=168.92s)]
*  But instead, this is when the committee says those audits began. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  None began the first two years of his presidency. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  The first one for 2015 began April 3, 2019. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=179.56s)]
*  That was the same day the House committee chairman [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=183.92s)]
*  sent the first letter to the IRS requesting Trump's tax returns. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=186.42s)]
*  It was just three months after Democrats took control of the House [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=190.22s)]
*  after the midterm elections. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=193.42s)]
*  And Democrats said getting Trump's tax returns [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  would be one of their first actions. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=197.32s)]
*  And then I assumed that there would be a court case [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=199.12s)]
*  that would go on for a period of time. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=201.32s)]
*  He was right. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=203.82s)]
*  That first letter kicked off a back and forth [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  between the committee and the Trump administration. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=207.45999999999998s)]
*  The Treasury secretary argued the law wasn't clear. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  It is our intent to follow the law, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=212.76s)]
*  and that is in the process of being reviewed. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  Mr. Trump and his Treasury secretary are stonewalling us. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=218.82s)]
*  But two years later, the new Biden administration's Justice Department [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=222.32s)]
*  said the law showed the Treasury could release the returns. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  And a court battle began, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=229.01999999999998s)]
*  with Trump himself suing to block the release. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=230.66s)]
*  It eventually got to the Supreme Court. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=233.66s)]
*  They declined to intervene, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=236.26s)]
*  defaulting to the last appeals court ruling. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=237.7s)]
*  The committee had the right to the returns. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=240.06s)]
*  By a week later, they had them in hand. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  A month later, they voted to release the returns publicly. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=244.85999999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's a journey. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=247.92s)]
*  I was writing stories during the 2016 campaign about him saying he's under audit [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  and him saying he's not going to release his returns voluntarily. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=253.73999999999998s)]
*  So really, it's a seven and a half year legal [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=256.26s)]
*  and political fight over this norm of disclosure. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=260.2s)]
*  The returns likely won't change anything for the former president [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=265.86s)]
*  and 2024 presidential candidate. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=269.0s)]
*  But it might change how the IRS handles these presidential audits in the future. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mRFBtnDDrY&t=271.8s)]
