# Hyperloop TT vs. Virgin The Race to Make Muskâ€™s Moonshot a Reality  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE)
*  It's a conch, a rail gun and an air hockey table. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=0.0s)]
*  You'll be able to be faster than the world's fastest bullet train. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=3.84s)]
*  I have a name for it, which is called the Hyperloop. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=6.8s)]
*  In 2013, Elon Musk sketched out an idea to use magnetically levitating capsules inside [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=9.76s)]
*  near vacuum chambers to create a new super-fast mode of transport that could connect LA to San [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=15.92s)]
*  Francisco in around half an hour. Fast forward to 2021 and two companies, Virgin Hyperloop and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=22.32s)]
*  Hyperloop TT, are in a neck-and-neck race to turn the idea into a reality and develop the world's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=29.36s)]
*  first commercial Hyperloop system. Virgin Hyperloop will be the first. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  I think that we are leading the race. They've both raised tens of millions of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=39.92s)]
*  dollars from high-profile investors, with Virgin founder Richard Branson backing that group's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=43.6s)]
*  project. The speed we can put these tracks, these tunnels at is dramatic. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=48.8s)]
*  Virgin has already run tests with passengers. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=54.96s)]
*  Both companies have signed agreements to potentially carry paying passengers and goods [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=59.84s)]
*  by the end of the decade in the US and other countries. But there are still a lot of questions [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=64.24s)]
*  around safety, business models and just how the technology can work in the real world. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=69.04s)]
*  There's a lot of kind of things and details that need to be ironed out in order to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=73.76s)]
*  know really whether it revolutionized transport. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=77.92s)]
*  So will there be a winner in the race to bring Hyperloop into the real world? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=80.48s)]
*  First, let's take a step back. Hyperloop is not a brand new concept. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  It's actually been around since the 17th century. Rosaline Walker is a transport analyst who's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  advising the European Union on Hyperloop as it assesses the potential of the technology. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=95.52s)]
*  Lots of different variations of it have for one reason or another failed due to flaws in the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=100.32s)]
*  systems or concepts. In the early 1800s, inventors were exploring using pneumatic tubes to transport [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=104.32s)]
*  people from point A to point B. And nowadays, that principle is being used in everyday things [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=110.48s)]
*  such as drive-through banking. And magnetic levitation has been around for decades, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  like some of the trains in China and Japan that can run at more than 350 miles an hour. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=121.2s)]
*  But projects that combine those two principles for electric-powered capsules that can reach speeds [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  of up to 760 miles an hour have accelerated in recent years. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  But Musk said he wasn't going to build it himself. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=140.48s)]
*  Whilst he's not developing Hyperloop himself, he is active in this space. So after the launch of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  the white paper, his company SpaceX has hosted, I think, up to four competitions for Hyperloop. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=149.12s)]
*  We built a Hyperloop test track adjacent to SpaceX just for a student competition. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=154.96s)]
*  It was sort of quite fun to do that, but it was kind of a hobby thing. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=160.16s)]
*  As a result of that, there's been a number of Hyperloop companies that have developed. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=163.84s)]
*  Hyperloop TT was founded in California in 2013 and says it has some $130 million [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=167.44s)]
*  in funding. Today we've got more than 800 contributors in 60 companies that are [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=174.32s)]
*  working together to develop it. Andres De Leon is Hyperloop TT's CEO. He says the company has [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=180.0s)]
*  created this full-scale carriage and a test track in Europe and is teaming up with rail firms Hitachi [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=186.4s)]
*  and Altran. This is really the first time that the transportation industry, the legacy transportation [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  industry is really starting to believe in the iPhone. Virgin has more money, about $400 million. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=198.0s)]
*  Their CEO Jay Walder says not only is their test track longer, but it's also carried its first [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=205.12s)]
*  passengers. We decided that we really needed to be able to build physical assets and to be able to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=210.96s)]
*  show what we can do. We took a huge monumental milestone step where we saw the first people [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=217.52s)]
*  ride in a Hyperloop. I think it's a race to be able to get this done right now and we really love [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=224.24s)]
*  the race. Some analysts say Virgin has the edge, mostly because of its patents and resources. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  This is really based on the facts. Probably Virgin is ahead of the grain and they've got the money [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=235.12s)]
*  for the R&D so it kind of feels like they are winning the race, but who knows. The next big [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  goal for both Virgin and Hyperloop TT is to build six-mile-long test tracks by 2025. We want to break [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=246.4s)]
*  ground in West Virginia soon to be able to do that. We hope to have the commercial [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=253.52s)]
*  prototype in Abu Dhabi up and running in two and a half, three years. Governments, including the UAE [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=260.32s)]
*  and Europe, have evaluated the feasibility of Hyperloop projects and both companies have studied [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=266.16s)]
*  how they could connect U.S. cities less than 900 miles apart, like Kansas City and St. Louis or [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=272.0s)]
*  Chicago and Pittsburgh. The Department of Transportation said some Hyperloop projects [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=278.48s)]
*  could be eligible for federal grants. We're working toward the certification of this technology [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=283.44s)]
*  by 2025 and that gives us the ability to go forward not as technology but as a transportation [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  system. But before you can run Hyperloops across the U.S., you would need to get permission to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=298.56s)]
*  build huge infrastructure, which could meet resistance. Even Elon Musk has run into problems. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=303.84s)]
*  He's invested in a company called The Boring Company, which is an infrastructure and tunneling [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  company focusing on trying to reduce the cost of tunneling. When The Boring Company planned to dig [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  tunnels under Los Angeles in 2018 to reduce traffic, it was sued by locals and had to build [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=319.2s)]
*  another tunnel in a different part of the city. Similar tunnels could also be used by Hyperloops. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=324.96s)]
*  You can picture then a Hyperloop in a tunnel running quite long distances. Exactly. Hyperloop [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=330.48s)]
*  companies also have to figure out passenger safety and business models. The major risk is around, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=337.76s)]
*  you know, having vehicles traveling at speeds faster than any other public transport mode we've [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=343.36s)]
*  ever had before, operating at very short intervals to each other inside braking distance in a very [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=348.88s)]
*  inhospitable environment. So if there's an incident, you know, you're enclosed in a vacuum [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=354.16s)]
*  tube, which is not ideal for breathing. Experts worry sudden acceleration to such a high speed [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=360.32000000000005s)]
*  in a windowless chamber could also make passengers sick. The cost of Hyperloop travel could also be [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=365.92s)]
*  too high for most people. And if terminals had to be built on the outskirts of cities, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=372.32000000000005s)]
*  the whole system would be less efficient. By the time you've transited to those Hyperloop [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=377.68s)]
*  terminals and gone through security checks, etc, etc, then that undermines the speed advantage [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=382.64s)]
*  that you've got. Addressing these concerns, Hyperloop TT and Virgin Hyperloop have both said [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=388.47999999999996s)]
*  they've developed systems to keep people safe. But the first Hyperloops may not be carrying [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=393.68s)]
*  passengers at all. Our future ports will integrate Hyperloop technology for synchronized, seamless, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=399.44s)]
*  intelligent movement of cargo. Freight will absolutely be the first type of Hyperloop system, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=405.28s)]
*  I think, on the market. And it's not necessarily the biggest benefit, but it's a way of testing [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=410.8s)]
*  the concept and getting people used to it without having that passenger risk involved. As to who [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=415.04s)]
*  will win between Virgin and Hyperloop TT, for now, both companies are benefiting from the hype. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=420.40000000000003s)]
*  You're seeing Hyperloop as an industry. This is Hyperloop with a small H. It's the way we think [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=427.04s)]
*  about the word train, for example. And I think that's great. This shouldn't be just about one [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=433.36s)]
*  company. It should be about building an industry. I think that there is a space for two companies. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=439.44s)]
*  And I think that it's good for the industry that there are more than one big company, you know, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=444.56s)]
*  trying to develop that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWzZ_OeMHE&t=450.16s)]
