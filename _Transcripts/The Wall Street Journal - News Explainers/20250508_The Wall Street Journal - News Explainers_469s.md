Video Description: The cocaine trade is far bigger and more geographically diverse than at any other point in history with some groups opening up underwater smuggling routes from South America as far as Europe and Australia, using homemade narco submarines. In 2019, the first narco sub in Europe was found off the coast of the Spanish region of Galicia after a 27-day journey across the Atlantic. 

WSJ explores how drug cartels are evading authorities using submersibles to deliver record-breaking shipments worth billions of dollars around the world.

*  This team of agents is on the hunt for drug traffickers. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=0.0s)]
*  Right now, gangs have the upper hand. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=4.68s)]
*  They're adapting new ways to evade detection, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=7.88s)]
*  including man-made submersibles. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=10.44s)]
*  How does it work? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=12.72s)]
*  Now capable of smuggling cocaine across entire oceans. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=14.76s)]
*  Authorities granted the Wall Street Journal access [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=19.44s)]
*  to their patrol operations in Spain [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=21.52s)]
*  on a critical mission to detect narco subs. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=23.6s)]
*  Finding these makeshift vessels constructed [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  deep in the jungle is more important than ever, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=29.64s)]
*  as the global cocaine trade hits an all-time high. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=32.44s)]
*  This team is on patrol every day, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=42.0s)]
*  scouring the coast of northern Spain for illegal activity. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=44.08s)]
*  It's so hard to find a narco submarine [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=47.84s)]
*  because they are not very high from the water. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  They're more clever now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=52.72s)]
*  So far, at least three narco subs have been found [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=54.88s)]
*  in waters close to the Spanish region of Galicia [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=57.72s)]
*  over the past five years, although authorities estimate [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=60.16s)]
*  around 30 could have avoided detection during that time. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=63.16s)]
*  The first, in 2019, sent shockwaves around the world, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=66.76s)]
*  as it proved the vessels were more sophisticated [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=70.36s)]
*  and could travel further than previously known. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=72.76s)]
*  Officials say it set off from Brazil [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=82.32s)]
*  before traveling for 27 days across the Atlantic Ocean, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=84.2s)]
*  a journey of roughly 4,000 miles. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=87.52s)]
*  Authorities say most narco subs are built by cartels [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=102.16s)]
*  in jungle areas across South America, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  where they utilize the natural landscape to stay hidden. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=107.44s)]
*  Brazil is perfect because as you expand Google Maps, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=117.52s)]
*  you realize that this is a labyrinth of islands, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  mangrove islets, afluents. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=124.08s)]
*  I mean, the Amazon is not a big caudal that you can see. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=128.0s)]
*  There's the mouth of the sea, that's a world. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  So that's why that area is especially good, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=132.72s)]
*  because you can hide a harbour there, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=135.0s)]
*  you build it, you throw it into the water, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  and with nocturnity and ebony, you get it out at night. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=140.2s)]
*  Authorities estimate it typically costs around a million dollars [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=144.48s)]
*  to construct each vessel. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=147.4s)]
*  Although they're dubbed narco subs, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=156.48s)]
*  they're rarely full submarines. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=158.96s)]
*  This one, a semi-submersible, has the capacity to hold [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=161.0s)]
*  around $139 million of cocaine inside. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=164.04s)]
*  When in motion, the colossal 70-foot vessel [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  lies low in the water, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=170.16s)]
*  with around a quarter of its 10-foot height above the sea level. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  The cramped interior leaves just enough space [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=174.72s)]
*  for three crew members. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=177.16s)]
*  Inside, its makeshift construction is laid bare. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=178.92s)]
*  Fraying wires hang from the steering wheel. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=182.92s)]
*  Pipes obstruct the space where they slept. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=185.67999999999998s)]
*  And there is no toilet. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=188.6s)]
*  Behind the only door sits an engine in a cupboard. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=190.27999999999997s)]
*  The rusting keys are still in the ignition, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=201.64s)]
*  and decaying packets of food and medication [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=204.64s)]
*  are all that's been left behind on this narco sub. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=207.04s)]
*  Although a new phenomenon in Europe, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=210.04s)]
*  the crafts have been used across the Americas for decades. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  But the only way to get to the bottom of the matter [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=216.27999999999997s)]
*  is to use a machine. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  The only way to get to the bottom of the matter [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=220.64s)]
*  is to use a machine. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=223.11999999999998s)]
*  And that's what we're doing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=224.44s)]
*  We're making a machine out of the sea. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=225.88s)]
*  We're making a machine out of the sea. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  The drug use in the Americas for decades. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=230.0s)]
*  Some known routes go from Ecuador and Colombia [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=232.8s)]
*  in the Pacific Ocean to Central America, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=235.24s)]
*  before disembarking and taking the drug across land in Mexico [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=237.4s)]
*  to reach the US mainland. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  Others have been discovered in the Caribbean Sea. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  But despite efforts from law enforcement agencies [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=247.36s)]
*  spanning the globe, a mere fraction of narco subs are caught. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=249.88s)]
*  Drug gangs use low-tech methods to avoid detection. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  Narcos have often painted different colors for camouflage, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=257.84s)]
*  depending on the ocean they plan on traveling in. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=260.91999999999996s)]
*  The Spanish agents hunting them down [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  say it's almost impossible to see them in open water. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  Narcos sail in water. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=268.76s)]
*  And radars merge them with the waves. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=271.76s)]
*  It's as simple as that. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=275.84s)]
*  So the radar can detect the signal for a while, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=277.64s)]
*  but then it loses it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=281.44s)]
*  Because the radar merges the wave [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  with the structure that floats in the water. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=285.0s)]
*  One of the only tools at their disposal [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=287.2s)]
*  are thermal imagery cameras. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  They detect the heat from inside vessels, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=291.52s)]
*  illuminating them in the darkness. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=293.48s)]
*  But since the agents have to search such a vast area, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=296.16s)]
*  the narco subs are often able to hide in plain sight. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=299.36s)]
*  While out at sea, they offload the drugs onto smaller vessels, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=302.8s)]
*  which take them to shore. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=305.88s)]
*  Then, sparsely populated mountainous areas in Galicia [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=320.72s)]
*  help groups to disperse the cocaine on land [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=324.12s)]
*  undetected during the night. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=326.76s)]
*  Authorities say drug gangs are also using narco subs [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  as part of a wider strategy [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=332.68s)]
*  to effectively flood the zone with cocaine. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=334.44s)]
*  That strategy involves using different transport methods [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=338.76s)]
*  at the same time, in an aim to overwhelm agents [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=341.72s)]
*  who have limited resources to catch them. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=345.0s)]
*  Part of that tactic is outsmarting agents [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=349.56s)]
*  by pouring a record amount of cocaine through ports, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=351.84s)]
*  including this major trade hub. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=355.2s)]
*  Agents are always one step before us. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=357.47999999999996s)]
*  They can scan the container in the double bottom of the container, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=361.88s)]
*  this area here. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=375.64s)]
*  Agents also search containers by hand [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=379.96s)]
*  to check for any hidden products. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  In this case, they have the order to open doors [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=384.32s)]
*  and check that there is nothing. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=387.28s)]
*  All their cases, we order them that they have to take all their goods [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=389.76s)]
*  and take out and check everything. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=394.88s)]
*  Detecting the drugs is nearly impossible. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=397.56s)]
*  European ports handle over 90 million containers each year, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  and authorities report only 2 to 10 percent [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=404.52s)]
*  can be physically inspected. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=407.32s)]
*  The cocaine that is seized ends up here. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=410.4s)]
*  In an undisclosed location, the Wall Street Journal [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  was given rare access to see a recent haul. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=416.28s)]
*  Laboratory workers test the drug, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=420.76s)]
*  which is used as evidence during trials. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=423.56s)]
*  They say this batch is 90 percent pure cocaine, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=426.28s)]
*  meaning it's only cut with 10 percent of other agents. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=429.92s)]
*  What is said today is that it had never been so cheap [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=432.8s)]
*  because it had never been so cheap to import drugs [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=437.68s)]
*  because of the excess of the supply that is in origin. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=443.48s)]
*  Even though authorities around the world [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=447.52s)]
*  are making record-breaking seizures, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=449.08s)]
*  they're still struggling to keep up with the cartel's latest innovations. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=451.32s)]
*  Agents admit they're being left behind [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=455.76s)]
*  and fear the development of unmanned drones [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLIThfY2qc&t=458.08s)]
