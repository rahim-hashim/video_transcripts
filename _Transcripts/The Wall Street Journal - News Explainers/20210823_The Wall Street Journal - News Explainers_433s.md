# Why Environmentalists Are Fighting Renewable Energy Development | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg)
*  A wave of development is rippling through the windy and sunny parts of the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=0.0s)]
*  In the Midwest, newer and bigger wind turbines are rankling the locals. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=5.92s)]
*  And fights over solar farms have broken out in California and Virginia as well. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=10.68s)]
*  New research says that if this movement continues, it could stall the country's green energy [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=15.56s)]
*  transition. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=19.88s)]
*  We used to think that there's sufficient land for the wind that is needed, but now [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=20.88s)]
*  we believe that there could be some land use conflicts that would actually hit some of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=25.92s)]
*  the limits to wind development. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=29.92s)]
*  The fights about solar and wind are all about how land is used. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  In several parts of rural America, locals say that the installations are dominating [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=36.42s)]
*  the landscapes. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=41.0s)]
*  So these projects are as big as they are because that's what makes them as cheap as they are. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=42.0s)]
*  Samantha Gross, who studies energy security at the Brookings Institution, says that most [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=46.32s)]
*  U.S. wind turbines are roughly 500 feet tall and are spaced more than half a mile apart. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=51.2s)]
*  These installations can be seen for miles. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=58.22s)]
*  You have projects being put in place in those areas where people aren't used to seeing a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=61.1s)]
*  lot of development. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=65.42s)]
*  And they're there because that's where they need to be. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=66.42s)]
*  But they can generate public opposition because they're a real change to the use of the land. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=68.74s)]
*  Researchers say that it takes at least 10 times as much land to develop renewables when [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=74.5s)]
*  compared to fossil fuels. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=78.56s)]
*  If you think about making electricity from natural gas and the kind of land footprint [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=79.9s)]
*  that has, it's about one tenth the land area per unit of power that you have for a wind [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=85.38s)]
*  facility. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=92.66s)]
*  You can do other things with that land. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=94.38s)]
*  You can farm underneath it, have it for pasture land. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=95.97999999999999s)]
*  But still, that land will be occupied by the wind facility. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=99.22s)]
*  Despite these land use issues, financiers and leaders in Washington are pouring money [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=104.02s)]
*  into new green energy projects. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=108.69999999999999s)]
*  What we as a country should do is make smart, sustainable investments with appropriate financing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=110.82s)]
*  to make this nation more productive, to advance America's leadership in clean energy, to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=119.33999999999999s)]
*  win the jobs of the future while meeting the threat of climate change. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=124.02s)]
*  The high level of interest in clean energy is causing controversy as the rubber hits [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=128.34s)]
*  the road out in the country. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=132.54s)]
*  Several states in the U.S. wind corridor are grappling with how to deploy more renewables [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=135.1s)]
*  for the grid. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=139.04s)]
*  The state of Indiana started to experiment with utility scale wind power in 2008. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=140.62s)]
*  As of 2021, 40 of the state's 92 counties have some amount of wind or solar development. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=145.98000000000002s)]
*  But a groundswell of activism has taken over county and state level politics. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=152.46s)]
*  Citizens across Indiana have campaigned against new clean energy developments, arguing that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=157.66s)]
*  the structures are an economic scam that will be a nuisance to public health, biodiversity, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=161.98000000000002s)]
*  and local property values. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=166.82s)]
*  The movement gained influence over the years. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=168.86s)]
*  As of 2021, more than 30 Indiana counties have restricted the development of utility [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=171.18s)]
*  scale renewables. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=176.46s)]
*  Many use setback requirements, which determine how far away projects must be removed from [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=179.38000000000002s)]
*  existing properties. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=184.3s)]
*  This tactic can keep turbines away from homes, which reduces the flickering shadows and noise [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=186.28000000000003s)]
*  created by the installations. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=191.18s)]
*  But some residents would like to see the bans on renewables come to an end. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  There are folks who are saying, wait a minute, my county lost millions of dollars in tax [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=198.9s)]
*  revenue. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=204.18s)]
*  State legislators like Ed Soliday, a Republican representing Valparaiso, Indiana, say that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=205.38s)]
*  the restrictions may harm the region's economy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=210.86s)]
*  In 2021, Soliday wrote and introduced House Bill 1381, which would have prevented counties [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=214.26s)]
*  from issuing outright bans on wind and solar projects. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=219.98000000000002s)]
*  The one thing we know for sure is there's a market for renewable energy, and we can [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=223.24s)]
*  either pay ever-rising transmission costs to buy it from someone else, or we can participate [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=228.98000000000002s)]
*  in the market here in Indiana. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=235.08s)]
*  The bill introduced by Soliday died in the state's 2021 legislative session as locals [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  push back. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=242.04000000000002s)]
*  He says a similar battle is unfolding over solar energy. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=243.28s)]
*  That same group that opposed wind has now come up with health arguments, visual arguments [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=247.08s)]
*  against solar panels. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=253.42000000000002s)]
*  And most of those will not stand up to peer review. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=255.56s)]
*  It's important that these projects are designed to be serving the community as a whole, because [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=259.36s)]
*  if they're not designed that way, it can lead to downstream flooding, it can lead to resentment, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=264.38s)]
*  and therefore antagonism, and therefore opposition to these projects. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=273.44s)]
*  Jesse Carbanda is the executive director at the Hoosier Environmental Council. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=276.8s)]
*  His group supports renewable energy. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  By the end of the decade, the overall land footprint of the solar farms in Indiana could [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=283.14s)]
*  be of the size of the entire Indiana State Park system. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  And so how solar farms are designed in the backdrop of climate change really matters, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=294.72s)]
*  because they can act as an agent for community resilience in the face of more intense and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=300.86s)]
*  more frequent flooding, or they could exacerbate it if they're designed poorly. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=306.6s)]
*  Critics say that the solar farms will eliminate farmland and could disrupt natural habitats. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=311.52s)]
*  Similar conflicts have broken out across the plains of Kansas and Ohio, in the sunny California [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=317.56s)]
*  desert, and along the windy northern Atlantic coast. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=321.76s)]
*  Plans for wind farms in the northeast were introduced in the 2000s, but as of 2021, little [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=325.76s)]
*  had been built beyond a five turbine project near Rhode Island. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=330.8s)]
*  That didn't keep developers from pursuing the area. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=335.04s)]
*  Biden officials have given final approval to a $2.8 billion project to place 84 turbines [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=338.28000000000003s)]
*  12 miles off the coast of Nantucket Island. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=343.92s)]
*  Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are modeling how these political [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=347.92s)]
*  battles will affect the country's energy supply. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=351.56s)]
*  It's very difficult to capture people within models. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  The social or human side is always hard to distill into a set of equations. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=356.56s)]
*  True Mai is a senior energy analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=361.12s)]
*  His team's research shows that the U.S. has enough wind resources to power the grid. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=365.79999999999995s)]
*  But the local opposition movements are starting to limit the supply of land that can be used [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=370.15999999999997s)]
*  for wind farms. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  When Mai's team modeled out a scenario where populated counties keep banning renewables, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=376.08s)]
*  development was concentrated into the relatively unsettled Mountain West. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=381.15999999999997s)]
*  We never expected land to be a constraint for wind and renewable deployment for all [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=385.44s)]
*  the energy needs that we have. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=391.28s)]
*  But now that we've looked into this further, land use conflicts is a very important issue here. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=393.2s)]
*  Experts say that the bans on renewables will push up the costs of the energy transition. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=398.6s)]
*  That's because wind and solar are among the cheapest sources of energy, according to levelized [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  cost estimates from the consulting agency, Lazard. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=408.68s)]
*  Renewables have been deemed critical to the future of the global economy. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=412.96s)]
*  But the backlashes unfolding in the U.S. show a latent risk as the green energy markets heat up. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yWihp9RGg&t=416.91999999999996s)]
