# Kodak Tries to Reinvent After Struggling to Adapt | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 22, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so)
*  A Kodak moment was once synonymous with photos. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=0.0s)]
*  The moments of your life are priceless. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=3.6s)]
*  Are you saving them on the right film? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=6.8s)]
*  Kodak Gold. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=9.6s)]
*  At its peak, Eastman Kodak was the early 20th century equivalent of Google or Apple, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=11.0s)]
*  once possessing a near monopoly in the film business. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=16.6s)]
*  But the company's days at the top are now a memory. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=19.8s)]
*  Since the digital revolution unspooled the company's dominant position, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=22.8s)]
*  it's released products to try and keep up, some a far cry from cameras and film. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=26.8s)]
*  And recently, an announcement to produce drug ingredients sent its stock price surging [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=32.4s)]
*  and embroiled the company in a controversy that has thrusted back in the limelight, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=37.6s)]
*  which has raised questions amongst consumers and investors alike. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=41.6s)]
*  Can the company create another Kodak moment? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=45.2s)]
*  George Eastman got into the photography business in 1880, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=50.2s)]
*  and he pledged to make taking photos as convenient as the pencil. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=53.800000000000004s)]
*  You can see that notion in an early slogan. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=57.6s)]
*  You press the button, we do the rest. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=60.0s)]
*  In 1884, he patented a way of packaging film in roll form, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=62.6s)]
*  and four years later introduced the first Kodak camera. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=67.2s)]
*  Then, in 1889, Eastman began selling the first commercial transparent roll film, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=70.8s)]
*  which made it possible for Thomas Edison to develop the motion picture camera. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=76.4s)]
*  So it's a highly profitable business and you don't have a whole lot of competitors. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=80.6s)]
*  That's basically the business model right there. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=84.8s)]
*  The company innovated photographic solutions for consumers and businesses alike. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=87.0s)]
*  For example, the Recordak was a 1920s camera that allowed banks to photograph checks to prevent fraud. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=91.8s)]
*  George Eastman died in 1932, but his namesake company stayed focused on his vision [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=99.0s)]
*  of turning photography and then film into a pastime for ordinary people. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=104.0s)]
*  They had this one product that had a high-level profit margin that allowed them to do lots of other things. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=108.8s)]
*  They would get into lens manufacturing, they would get into the copier business. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=115.2s)]
*  I mean, they had lots of different businesses, but the core of it really was the profit margin from film. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=119.6s)]
*  Kodak's dominance continued through World War II. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=126.2s)]
*  Then, competition began to emerge. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=129.0s)]
*  Polaroid released in 1948 a new camera that turned out a finished picture one minute after the shutter snapped. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=131.4s)]
*  But Kodak remained in the eyes of some a monopoly and faced multiple antitrust cases from the US government. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=139.0s)]
*  Still, the company continued introducing new products like simpler, more affordable movie cameras. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=145.6s)]
*  Let me show you how easy Kodak has made it for you and me with a Kodak Instamatic movie camera. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=151.4s)]
*  And with an eye towards maintaining its position well into the future, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=156.6s)]
*  the company in 1978 patented the first digital camera, which saved images onto a cassette tape. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  But it was slow on commercializing digital camera technology because it feared it would cannibalize its film business. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=166.8s)]
*  Digital photography was not their prime business. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=173.0s)]
*  Digital photography was largely funded by the profits made by film. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=175.4s)]
*  By 1988, Kodak had become a mammoth international company that employed more than 145,000 people. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=180.4s)]
*  That year, it had its highest earnings ever. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=187.0s)]
*  The company viewed rival Fuji as its biggest threat. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=189.8s)]
*  The Japanese company was going after Kodak loyalists with promotions and advertising. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  By 1989, Fuji had captured 11% of the US market. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=198.0s)]
*  For Kodak, the days of double-digit growth in its film business were over. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=202.2s)]
*  In 1993, the film giant brought in a CEO from the outside to turn things around. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  George Fisher was credited with Motorola's resurgence. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=211.6s)]
*  And when he got to Kodak, Fisher fought what he viewed as Fuji's unfair advantage in the Japanese market. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  What we face is in fact a highly controlled distribution system that denies Kodak full access to Japan's consumer film and paper market. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=221.2s)]
*  The World Trade Organization ultimately rejected US claims of Japanese protectionism in photographic film. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, Fisher pursued another priority, pushing the company into the digital era. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=237.2s)]
*  But it wasn't a profitable business. They didn't make money on any of these products. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=242.0s)]
*  In 1997, digital imaging had become a loss leader for the company. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=246.8s)]
*  That year, Kodak was on track to lose an estimated $400 million. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  And in traditional film products, Fuji was continuing to gain market share. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  That fall, Kodak slashed 10,000 jobs. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=260.8s)]
*  At the turn of the millennium, a new CEO entered the scene and introduced a slew of new products. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=263.8s)]
*  Some of them actually took. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=268.8s)]
*  It entered the inkjet and digital printer markets, competing head-on with Hewlett-Packard, Canon, and Debson. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  So they said, all right, prints are the way to go. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=276.6s)]
*  So we'll sell a home printer for reasonable money. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=279.8s)]
*  But unfortunately, the one thing that happened with this business is it just never really took off because people just don't make that many photographic prints anymore. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=282.6s)]
*  People stopped printing photos in part because this happened. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=294.0s)]
*  In 2007, Apple's always-with-you cam, the iPhone, ushered in a photographic revolution. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=300.8s)]
*  On the back, the biggest thing of note is we got a two megapixel camera built right in. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=307.8s)]
*  Between 2008 and 2011, Kodak's digital camera sales began to decline year after year. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=313.8s)]
*  To survive, it sold off some of its businesses and its patent portfolio. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=320.6s)]
*  If you look at sales of coin-and-shoot cameras, whether it's film cameras or digital cameras, they're basically almost gone. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=324.8s)]
*  In 2012, the company filed for bankruptcy protection and got out of the digital camera business. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  For a new generation, iPhone and Instagram supplanted Kodak as the brand synonymous with photography. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=338.8s)]
*  Kodak emerged from bankruptcy about a year later with a new CEO. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  The Kodak brand is probably one of the best-known brand names in the world. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=349.6s)]
*  So part of what they ended up doing was to license that word, their name. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=354.6s)]
*  You name it, they put their name on it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=359.20000000000005s)]
*  The film company pivoted to commercial printing and put its name on tablets and smartphones. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=362.0s)]
*  In 2018, it introduced its own cryptocurrency called Kodak Coin as part of a platform to help photographers track and license their work. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  But over the last decade, the company's stock price has continued to decline. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=376.0s)]
*  Then this happened. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=380.20000000000005s)]
*  The coronavirus crisis. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=381.8s)]
*  The coronavirus death toll rising. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=383.6s)]
*  And there are new cases of the disease here in the United States. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=385.6s)]
*  In July, amidst concerns about availability of American products to help in the pandemic, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=389.0s)]
*  President Donald Trump announced Kodak had won a first-of-its-kind $765 million government loan under the Defense Production Act. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=394.2s)]
*  My administration has reached a historic agreement with a great American company. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=403.8s)]
*  You remember this company? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=409.6s)]
*  It's called, from the good old camera age, the old days, to begin producing critical pharmaceutical ingredients. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=410.8s)]
*  It's called Kodak. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=420.1s)]
*  Kodak was a chemical company. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=422.0s)]
*  They produced their own processing chemicals that went with photography. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=424.6s)]
*  For a while, they owned Sterling Drug, which is a chemical company. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=430.20000000000005s)]
*  So again, whether people realize it or not, it actually makes sense for them to do that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=433.6s)]
*  That's kind of what their core business was. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=438.4s)]
*  The company's chief executive, Jim Continenza, said he expected the loan to create 300 jobs in Rochester, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=441.2s)]
*  where Kodak's based, and was confident it would go through. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=447.0s)]
*  Well, we feel very comfortable that we can bank on it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=450.79999999999995s)]
*  But it soon became clear to investors that the deal was far from done. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=452.9s)]
*  A misworded alert about the loan that Kodak sent to local media before the president's announcement [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=457.09999999999997s)]
*  sent the company's stock price on a roller coaster ride. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=462.09999999999997s)]
*  The deal was put on pause as the SEC looks at how Kodak disclosed the loan and stock option grants to executives. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=465.5s)]
*  All this happens as the company is losing money. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=472.1s)]
*  $5 million in the second quarter, compared with a profit of $201 million a year ago. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=474.8s)]
*  Kodak, a company whose products helped capture era after era, is still trying to redefine its own image in the current one. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nLL81y9so&t=480.9s)]
