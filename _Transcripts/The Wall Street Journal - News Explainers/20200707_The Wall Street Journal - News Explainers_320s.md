# What the Latest Purchasing Data Wonâ€™t Tell You | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M)
*  Global manufacturing is poised for a rebound after a rough start to 2020. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's a way to see that on paper. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  It's a global manufacturing purchasing managers index, or PMI for short. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  The chart tracks expected expansion or contraction in manufacturing activity around the world. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=13.16s)]
*  The numbers released in July 2020 show a manufacturing sector on the mend. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=18.88s)]
*  The score of 47.8 suggests the economy is contracting at a slower pace than it was earlier [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  this spring. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=28.74s)]
*  Economists rely on PMIs to get an early read on where the economy could be headed, but [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=30.5s)]
*  some warn that these numbers can't capture the full picture of this recession and its [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=35.18s)]
*  unique burden on smaller businesses. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=39.22s)]
*  The first thing to know about PMIs is where the data comes from. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=43.26s)]
*  The numbers on this chart come from a survey of more than 12,000 purchasing managers around [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=46.86s)]
*  the world. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=51.34s)]
*  Purchasing manager is the person in an organization that's responsible for getting in all of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=53.06s)]
*  the things that the company needs to make what it sells. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=57.86s)]
*  They kind of have a view on how much hiring is going on and all the services that they [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=62.06s)]
*  might buy in from other companies. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=66.3s)]
*  These purchasing managers answer questions about things like changes in production, new [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=69.58s)]
*  orders and change in prices over the previous month. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=73.9s)]
*  The managers report whether these numbers were higher, the same or lower. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=77.9s)]
*  Higher receives a 1, the same receives a .5, and lower receives a 0. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=82.54s)]
*  The answers are then added up, weighed and averaged into a score, and the scores are [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=89.7s)]
*  plotted into a chart like this one, where the 50 line marks the middle between growth [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=94.10000000000001s)]
*  and contraction. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=98.7s)]
*  One benefit of PMIs during periods of rapid economic change like the one we're in now [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=101.66000000000001s)]
*  is that they're able to come up with numbers fast, faster than many government measures. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=106.26s)]
*  When you're trying to measure something as complex as an economy, you've got a tradeoff. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=111.18s)]
*  And the tradeoff is between speed and accuracy or comprehensiveness. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=115.86000000000001s)]
*  If you want to know accurately how quickly the economy is growing through official figures, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=120.42s)]
*  you have to wait a few months. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=125.82000000000001s)]
*  With the PMIs, you're getting it more or less as it happens. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=128.22s)]
*  That timeliness has helped PMIs give economists a first look at economic downturns, at least [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=132.82s)]
*  when the economy was behaving normally. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=138.66s)]
*  Consider what happened in 2008 during the financial crisis that sparked the Great Recession. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=141.58s)]
*  That year, PMIs like the Flash Eurozone Index crossed the 50 line in November, an early [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=146.34s)]
*  warning of a coming economic contraction. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=151.46s)]
*  But official GDP data didn't pick up on what was happening until about three months later, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=154.46s)]
*  and when it did, it matched the trend captured by the PMI. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=159.38s)]
*  This episode solidified the reputation of PMIs as timely and credible tools. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=162.98s)]
*  So much so that central banks around the world now use the indicator to inform monetary policies [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=168.17999999999998s)]
*  like changes in interest rates. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=173.5s)]
*  But the economic contraction that began in 2020 may reveal a blind spot in PMI surveys. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=175.89999999999998s)]
*  They can't fully account for the smallest businesses like gig workers or freelancers. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=181.66s)]
*  That's because larger firms are more likely to respond to the surveys. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=186.06s)]
*  One thing that I think it's fair to say they miss out on is the very, very small businesses, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=190.06s)]
*  the mom and pop stores, the restaurants, the kinds of businesses that are probably most [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=195.34s)]
*  affected by the kind of lockdown that we've seen. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=201.74s)]
*  One of the issues I think that surveys like this have is that they are time consuming. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  So I think the information requirement may be a bit tough for very small businesses to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=209.86s)]
*  be able to handle. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=216.06s)]
*  But I think this reporting takes additional labor that some small businesses just can't supply. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=217.82s)]
*  This spring, companies with fewer than 500 employees lost about 18.4% of the pre-crisis [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=222.54s)]
*  workforce where bigger firms lost 16.6% according to ADP. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=228.34s)]
*  So you have to remember the limitations that the PMI has. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=233.73999999999998s)]
*  What is useful for figuring out is broadly how strong or weak the economy is growing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=237.22s)]
*  But it's not going to tell you which bits are growing and which bits are contracting. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=247.38s)]
*  Another limitation of a global PMI is that it's a composite. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  You have to look at breakdowns to spot regional differences. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=256.21999999999997s)]
*  For example, much of the recent upturn can be attributed to recent activity in China. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=259.86s)]
*  The country is reopening for business as others in the West are still working to contain the virus. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  The global manufacturing index is very heavily influenced by China, which is the largest [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=270.58s)]
*  manufacturer on the planet. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=275.74s)]
*  Now the key thing about China is obviously that it locked down earlier because the pandemic [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=278.3s)]
*  hit earlier. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=282.26s)]
*  So what it is is a sort of mix of China recovering and everyone else going through the contraction [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=283.54s)]
*  that China went through in January, February and March. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=291.98s)]
*  So in a way, it's sort of not telling you about the worst of this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=296.04s)]
*  So in this period, particularly in the lockdown period, data doesn't mean what it usually does. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=301.74s)]
*  It's not as solid. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=307.58s)]
*  Still as the recovery continues, investors and economists will have their eye on the 50 line. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4_pshMF3M&t=309.3s)]
