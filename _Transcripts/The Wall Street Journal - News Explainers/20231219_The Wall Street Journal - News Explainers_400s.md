# What Kim Jong Un’s Outfits Reveal About North Korea  | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk)
*  These photos show some of Kim Jong-un's most iconic public appearances as North Korea's leader over the past 12 years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=0.0s)]
*  From 2011, when he came to power following his father's death, to one of the many events he attended as North Korea emerged from the coronavirus pandemic. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=10.0s)]
*  Jenny Town is the director of 38 North, a North Korea-focused website. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=19.0s)]
*  She has been studying the subtle shifts in Kim's attire over the years. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=23.0s)]
*  Kim Jong-un is the face of North Korea and the persona that he puts out really tells you how he wants the people to see him. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=27.0s)]
*  We look at what can be gleaned about the changing state of North Korea from Kim's wardrobe choices. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=38.0s)]
*  And what his different looks signal about the future of his regime. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=44.0s)]
*  Kim Jong-un's public appearances are all carefully choreographed and often packed with symbolism. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=47.0s)]
*  In late 2019, Kim was pictured riding on a white horse through Mount Paektu. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=53.0s)]
*  The mountain is one of the country's most sacred sites, a place many North Koreans believe to be where the first Korean kingdom was founded. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=58.0s)]
*  These were special horses that were gifted to the Kim family. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=65.0s)]
*  Only the leaders have these special horses. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=68.0s)]
*  They would only have a photo shoot here if it was a very important message they were trying to send. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=71.0s)]
*  This was the North Koreans were going to do it in their own way, reasserting that self-reliance attitude. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=75.0s)]
*  Descendants of the Kim family, namely Kim Jong-un's late grandfather Kim Il-sung and father Kim Jong-il, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=84.0s)]
*  seen standing on the mountain in this painting, have run the country since its founding in 2000. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=90.0s)]
*  The Kim family's first Kim Jong-il, seen standing on the mountain in this painting, have run the country since its founding more than 70 years ago. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=96.0s)]
*  In another painting of the two former North Korean leaders on the peak shows there's one outfit that's common between all three Kims. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=103.0s)]
*  The Mao suit. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=110.0s)]
*  The pointed collar, two-the-neck buttoning and the four pockets in the front. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=113.0s)]
*  The suit is known as the Mao suit in the West because they were popularized during the reign of Mao Zedong, the founder of Communist China. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=119.0s)]
*  It's one of Kim's most common wardrobe choices. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=128.0s)]
*  You can see here, especially at the beginning of Kim Jong-un's tenure as the leader, you saw him wear this quite often. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=130.0s)]
*  Kim wore the Mao suit when he met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping during his first trip abroad since coming to power in 2018. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=140.0s)]
*  He also wore similar outfits in talks with different world leaders at a time when Pyongyang was negotiating nuclear disarmament with the U.S. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=148.0s)]
*  My friend. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=157.0s)]
*  He met with Donald Trump. He had this typical Mao suit on that was very representative of the North Korean identity. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=158.0s)]
*  It might have been, yeah, to differentiate himself from the other world leaders and to maintain that North Korean presence. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=166.0s)]
*  But Kim also likes to wear Western suits, especially while attending events back home. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=174.0s)]
*  Town says this shows Kim wants to portray a different image for the domestic audience. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=179.0s)]
*  In one of his New Year's speeches, he started to wear these Western suits in these formal meetings and especially the important ones. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=184.0s)]
*  There wasn't the Mao suit anymore domestically. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=192.0s)]
*  You saw much more of this global persona, much more of this Western style look. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=195.0s)]
*  I think there was a level of confidence here and trying to portray that the country was moving forward and especially on equal terms with the rest of the world. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=200.0s)]
*  Kim's appearance before, during and after the Covid-19 pandemic reflects his political messaging. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=213.0s)]
*  As negotiations over North Korea's denuclearisation collapsed in 2019, Kim made frequent public outings in a bid to rally the country. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=220.0s)]
*  He was out doing site visits like this one here. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=229.0s)]
*  He's out with the people in a pretty typical attire that's seasonally appropriate but casual to try and connect with the people more. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=232.0s)]
*  There was a lot of note that he was out doing these site visits maybe about every couple of weeks. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=244.0s)]
*  But when Covid-19 began to spread across the globe and North Korea closed its borders, Kim barely appeared in public. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=252.0s)]
*  Towards the middle to end of the pandemic, we did see sort of a new Kim Jong-un emerge. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=258.0s)]
*  You can see especially in this picture how much thinner he is especially compared to this one here. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=264.0s)]
*  One of the narratives that went on at that time domestically was that the people were also so concerned that he had lost so much weight [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=270.0s)]
*  and that he was suffering for the people along with the people during a very difficult time for the country. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=279.0s)]
*  But as the pandemic came to an end and North Korea began its gradual reopening, Kim started to look more like his old self. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=287.0s)]
*  There was definitely a shift in the public narrative in Kim Jong-un's priorities as well. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=293.0s)]
*  A real shift towards more military development. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=300.0s)]
*  We saw a lot of new missile systems being tested and developed. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=306.0s)]
*  We saw a lot more military activity when the economy wasn't doing so good. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=311.0s)]
*  That does convey a sense of optimism. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=316.0s)]
*  In March 2022, North Korean state media released a heavily edited video showing Kim wearing sunglasses and a black leather jacket [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=323.0s)]
*  as he oversaw the test of a new intercontinental ballistic missile. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=330.0s)]
*  For him to have come out in this bomber jacket really set the tone of trying to create his own persona, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=334.0s)]
*  trying to look more western, maybe it was trying to look kind of like Top Gun. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=341.0s)]
*  The Top Gun style jacket marked a shift away from the outfits that symbolised the cult of personality around his father and grandfather. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=352.0s)]
*  This is a good kind of depiction of the evolution of Kim Jong-un here. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=359.0s)]
*  Here we see him with a much more traditional look, trying to look like his grandfather, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=363.0s)]
*  trying to emulate that kind of traditional persona. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=369.0s)]
*  And here he's his own man, right? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=373.0s)]
*  He's had a lot of successes, especially in the military front and the missile front, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=376.0s)]
*  and things that his father and grandfather hadn't been able to accomplish. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=381.0s)]
*  And we have seen Kim Jong-un throughout this period as he develops his own not only style, but also his own style of leadership. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oDG7mQIpTk&t=385.0s)]
