# How Coronavirus Could Spread Through a Stadium  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 18, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg)
*  Picture the last game you attended. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=0.0s)]
*  The seats filled, fans cheering, concessions buzzing, and the lines, well those are always [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=6.54s)]
*  too long. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  Stadiums and arenas now sit empty, as leagues postponed or canceled games because of the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=13.98s)]
*  coronavirus pandemic. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=18.5s)]
*  The natural question is when will sporting events come back, but to understand when, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=20.96s)]
*  It's important to remember why fans aren't filling the stadiums now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=26.04s)]
*  One of the things that we've learned from watching Dr. Fauci is the statement, you know, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=29.96s)]
*  we don't control the timeline, you know, the virus does. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=36.0s)]
*  If that means not having any people in the audience when the NBA plays, so be it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=39.32s)]
*  Sitting shoulder to shoulder with other fans, reaching for a high five after a big play, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=45.2s)]
*  and grabbing food from concessions all make the game more fun and potentially more dangerous. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=50.36s)]
*  I think about the stadium the same way as I think about nursing homes, cruise ships, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=56.84s)]
*  jails and prisons. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=61.68s)]
*  It's among the highest risk areas. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  So let's take a look at the risks, proximity, contact and the shared environment to see [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=65.68s)]
*  why the stadium is primed for the spread of the coronavirus. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=70.64s)]
*  First, proximity. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=74.64s)]
*  What the virus is trying to do is transfer itself from somebody's nose or mouth to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=77.0s)]
*  somebody else's nose or mouth. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=81.0s)]
*  And the easiest way for that virus to do so is just going there directly. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=83.04s)]
*  This typically happens through droplets. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=88.04s)]
*  When we talk, respiratory droplets can jump from you to another person, but only if you're close. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=90.28s)]
*  That fluid droplet is a little bit heavy and it's going to fall within three feet if somebody [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=96.4s)]
*  isn't there to catch it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=101.58s)]
*  And it's not only three feet next to you, it's three feet before and behind you as well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=103.24s)]
*  That's why the CDC recommends people keep a distance of at least six feet from each other. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=108.52s)]
*  Three feet plus a buffer, according to doctors. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  Now let's bring the game into it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=116.64s)]
*  That cheering or yelling can propel infection-seeding droplets beyond three feet. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  Like a sneeze, the force of a scream can also create much smaller particles called aerosols. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  These are lighter so they can linger in the air for more time and travel further. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=130.6s)]
*  The stadium setting is really conducive for that because it's not only about the one-time [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=135.04s)]
*  immediate risk, it's the amount of hours of contacts. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  So even though the one-time aerosol is not going to do much in the real world, you have [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=145.84s)]
*  like constantly people shouting over many hours. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=150.92s)]
*  At some point the cumulative risk is going to be greater than the actual individual risk [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=154.76s)]
*  of the act itself. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=160.56s)]
*  In other words, the more exposure, the higher the chance you'll be infected. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  That brings us to the next important risk factor, prolonged contact. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  Not every interaction results in getting an infection. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  It's very unlikely for three people sitting next to each other, closely in the stadium, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=175.28s)]
*  to give it to each other in a domino effect because the virus has to incubate in the second [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=181.12s)]
*  person first before that second person can then transmit it to the third person. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=186.96s)]
*  An incubation usually occurs within seven days. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=191.88s)]
*  But games last for hours and that gives the virus plenty of opportunities to succeed in [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=194.84s)]
*  spreading from one infected person to several healthy people in their vicinity. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=200.32s)]
*  In the stadium, one of the issues that makes it very challenging to protect spectators [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=204.32s)]
*  from COVID-19 is social contact. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=209.06s)]
*  From my experience, social contact is one of the joys of even going to the stadium in the first place. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=212.18s)]
*  On February 19th, before the coronavirus had really taken hold in Italy, a soccer match [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=218.3s)]
*  filled the stadium in San Siro. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=223.54s)]
*  While it's very difficult to pinpoint the game as the key moment of transmission, two [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=226.14000000000001s)]
*  weeks later coronavirus cases in the Lombardy region shot up. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=230.38s)]
*  Fans have pointed to matches like that as potential super spreader events. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=235.34s)]
*  Fans want to hug, fist and chest bump and revel in the emotion of the game over and over again. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=239.5s)]
*  I think of the stadium as an adult preschool. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=245.3s)]
*  There's a lot of slobbering, there's a lot of secretions. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=248.22s)]
*  If the virus fails to directly land on a person's face and infect them that way, it has other means. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=251.18s)]
*  Let's take the celebratory high five. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=257.1s)]
*  So you are touching somebody's hand with a high five and even if you're able to stay [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=259.46s)]
*  during that high five, you're going to be potentially contaminating your hands and then [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=265.06s)]
*  when you touch your face you're wiping that sweat away, you're going to be introducing [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=269.34000000000003s)]
*  potential virus into your nose or your mouth. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=273.14000000000004s)]
*  Contaminated surfaces are another key risk factor. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=276.46000000000004s)]
*  And it's not just body parts. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=279.26000000000005s)]
*  Think bathrooms, concession stands, leachers, hand railings, shared food and beverages and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=281.1s)]
*  the containers they come in. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=285.82000000000005s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people can touch some of these objects and smear them with virus [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=287.34000000000003s)]
*  that can end up on someone's hands and then face. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=291.78000000000003s)]
*  This indirect mode of infection is known as fomite transmission. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=294.94s)]
*  While scientists think it's less efficient than direct transmission through droplets, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=298.86s)]
*  contaminated surfaces abound in stadiums. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=302.90000000000003s)]
*  To prevent fomite transmission, good personal hygiene is critical. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=306.0s)]
*  That means constant hand washing or hand sanitizing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=310.18s)]
*  Perhaps the most important challenge in the stadium is human. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=313.62s)]
*  You might be able to control your own hygiene and wear your own mask. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=318.06s)]
*  But what about the thousands of fans in seats around you? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=322.02s)]
*  To get through this is going to require a great deal of social trust. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=324.9s)]
*  Washing your hands is social trust. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=328.7s)]
*  Covering your cough is social trust. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=330.06s)]
*  Wearing a mask serves as a barrier, limiting how far your potentially virus-laden droplets [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=331.94s)]
*  can fly and the number of surfaces they can contaminate. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=336.62s)]
*  With COVID-19, there's a fair amount of asymptomatic transmission. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=340.46s)]
*  So people who don't feel sick are more likely to show up to games and then spread the virus. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=344.54s)]
*  Without widespread testing, it's harder to identify mild cases and isolate them. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=350.02000000000004s)]
*  We're trying to map out, you know, we sell about 85,000 season tickets, including students. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=358.78000000000003s)]
*  So if you have 103,000 seats, you know, that gives you, you know, 18,000 empty seats, you [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=365.38s)]
*  know, after your season ticket base. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=371.62s)]
*  And so physically, you know, all 85,000 people would not fit if we have to socially distance. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=374.62s)]
*  Texas A&M Athletic Director Ross Bjork says it's too early to say what if anything will [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=382.22s)]
*  change before the fall football season. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=387.82s)]
*  Games for now are still on. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=390.34000000000003s)]
*  Things are canceled pretty much on a uniform basis and a lot of coordination. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=392.3s)]
*  But as things start to go the other way and open up, there's not a clear indication of, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=398.26s)]
*  OK, this governing body can make this decision for all of college sports. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=404.46s)]
*  That question is playing out across America as economies start to open up again. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=409.02s)]
*  Texas was among the first states to reboot certain industries while trying to balance [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=413.98s)]
*  medical and economic risks. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=418.62s)]
*  That hasn't included sports yet, but... [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=420.82s)]
*  As we look at procedures around, you know, best practices for restaurants, they're looking [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=423.34s)]
*  at all those things. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=429.65999999999997s)]
*  I think we can, in a lot of ways, model, you know, what the restaurant industry is doing. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=430.65999999999997s)]
*  Restaurants have limited the number of customers that can come in. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=436.06s)]
*  For fans, a big part of the transition back to the stadium will be adjusting to a new normal. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=438.9s)]
*  I think an important corollary, I think about a lot, is before and after 9-11. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=444.46s)]
*  So before 9-11, you go to a stadium, you know, you wouldn't expect it a metal detector. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=448.38s)]
*  You wouldn't expect a pat down. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=452.98s)]
*  And now that's...we're waiting lines and queues for that, right? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=454.38s)]
*  That's expected. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=457.38s)]
*  For stadiums, it could mean playing the game with fewer fans or none at all, limiting concessions, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=458.42s)]
*  opting for mobile payments, and even giving spectators entrance and exit times. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=463.62s)]
*  That past visual of what the game was like is going to be very different in the near [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=468.78000000000003s)]
*  future. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=473.86s)]
*  And I think that's OK. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=474.86s)]
*  And in fact, I think people will expect that in order to feel comfortable. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysFND7kQBAg&t=475.86s)]
