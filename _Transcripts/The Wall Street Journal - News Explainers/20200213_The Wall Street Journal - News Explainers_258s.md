# How Scientists Are Trying to Develop a Coronavirus Vaccine | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 13, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM)
*  Scientists at the National Institutes of Health are working to create a vaccine for the new coronavirus that originated in China. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=0.0s)]
*  But they're not starting from scratch. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=9.28s)]
*  They're employing an approach called vaccine rapid response platforms. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=11.48s)]
*  It involves high-tech methods that have the potential to shave years off of development time. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Ideally, they'd offer protection while an epidemic was still spreading, instead of years later. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=20.88s)]
*  Within weeks of the world learning about the Wuhan outbreak, Chinese scientists uploaded the novel coronavirus's genetic sequence to a public database [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=27.32s)]
*  that allowed teams around the world to start designing a vaccine. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=35.96s)]
*  Traditional methods require an actual sample of the virus. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=39.4s)]
*  Typically, scientists inactivate a virus using special chemicals before it's put into a vaccine. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=43.08s)]
*  When the inactivated or weakened virus is injected into the body, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=49.08s)]
*  the immune system recognizes it as a foreign invader or an antigen. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=52.68s)]
*  Vaccines use antigens to prime the body to protect against a particular virus. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=56.92s)]
*  But vaccines developed with rapid response platforms work differently. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  Rather than directly injecting antigens into the body, these types of vaccines typically send instructions to cells in the body. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=66.6s)]
*  It gets the cells to produce antigen proteins that are specific to the virus it's designed to defeat. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=74.44s)]
*  These instructions are in the form of RNA or DNA, the molecules that contain the code for building proteins. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=81.0s)]
*  Scientists say this process cuts down on development time because they don't have to grow the whole virus. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=87.72s)]
*  Plus, once scientists identify and create the instructions for one virus, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=93.0s)]
*  they can tweak those instructions to make a vaccine for a similar virus. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=97.4s)]
*  So think of the backbone as a set player and the new virus sequence of our target, like from the new coronavirus, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  that sequence that we design in, think of it as a new cassette tape. So you can just slot it in. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=110.36s)]
*  You can slot in new virus antigens. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=117.0s)]
*  Melanie Saville is the Director of Vaccine Research and Development at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=121.0s)]
*  CEPI is a global partnership that was launched at Davos in 2017. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=127.32s)]
*  We were actually formed specifically to look at this type of situation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=132.2s)]
*  In this situation, the emergence of a new coronavirus, CEPI is funding several teams from around the world [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=137.56s)]
*  that Saville says are each independently working from the platform model. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=143.24s)]
*  The sort of technologies that we are looking at, some of which are really quite pioneering, can really move very quickly. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=147.72s)]
*  Three of the candidates are in a category called nucleic acid vaccines. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=155.8s)]
*  One of those candidates is Moderna, which is working with the NIH. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=159.88s)]
*  They're developing a vaccine on a platform that uses a part of the virus's genetic code called messenger RNA or mRNA. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=164.36s)]
*  So again, unlike the conventional approach with mRNA vaccine platforms, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=171.88s)]
*  it's our own body cells rather than lab techs that produce the antigen proteins that are like the ones made by the coronavirus. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=176.84s)]
*  Your immune system then will be stimulated and develop antibodies to the virus so that when you see it again, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=185.64s)]
*  it can immediately recognize the virus and prevent you from becoming sick. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=193.56s)]
*  More and more people are becoming sick from the novel coronavirus. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=199.48s)]
*  As the race for a viable vaccine continues, public health officials don't know how bad the situation will be [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=203.08s)]
*  by the time they hope to have a vaccine ready for widespread distribution. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=209.0s)]
*  Normally, vaccines will take years to get into the clinic. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=214.28s)]
*  So the sort of technologies that we are looking at can really move very quickly. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=217.8s)]
*  So an example of that is getting from identifying the sequence of the virus to developing the vaccine, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=222.28s)]
*  doing all of the preclinical testing, manufacturing and getting into the clinic in 16 weeks. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  So around four months during the 2003 SARS outbreak, that process took 20 months. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=235.88s)]
*  Experts say if one of the four teams CEPI's funding is successful, it would be a watershed moment for human health. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=242.2s)]
*  These are very promising candidates, but they're still quite early days. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuKywEZ5AM&t=249.64s)]
