# Why Harris and Trump’s ‘No Tax on Tips’ Policy Is So Controversial | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE)
*  We are going to not charge taxes on tips, people making tips. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=0.0s)]
*  And eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=5.92s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=11.56s)]
*  are both campaigning on this idea of cutting taxes on tips, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=14.96s)]
*  which many policy experts say [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=18.8s)]
*  violates some pretty basic principles of economic theory, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=20.56s)]
*  some pretty basic principles of tax policy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=23.12s)]
*  I think it'd be really hard pressed to find a professional economist [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=25.12s)]
*  who would say that this policy is well designed. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=28.96s)]
*  Experts warn this policy could help employers more than workers, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  increase the federal budget deficit, and even accelerate tipping culture. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=35.2s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  Right now, tips are treated as income [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=40.68s)]
*  and are subject to federal income, state and payroll taxes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=42.92s)]
*  Income taxes are what we think of as your taxes, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=46.72s)]
*  the federal tax return, the 1040s. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=50.0s)]
*  Payroll taxes go toward Social Security and Medicare. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=52.32000000000001s)]
*  The Trump campaign hasn't released the details of its plan yet. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=55.56s)]
*  The Harris campaign says its policy would only exempt tips from income tax. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=58.76s)]
*  This could be, you know, $100, $150 billion over a decade, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=63.56s)]
*  which is not the largest tax break out there. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=67.84s)]
*  There's certainly plenty of other things that are just as large. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=70.68s)]
*  But, you know, we're in a situation where the U.S. is running regular deficits these days, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=72.8s)]
*  and there's a lot of concern about the country's fiscal future. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=77.24s)]
*  Both candidates are pushing this tax policy to try to win Nevada, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  a swing state with the highest concentration of tipped workers. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=83.68s)]
*  When I'm president, you are the ones I will be fighting for, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=87.36s)]
*  and I'll be fighting for you very hard every single day. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=90.32s)]
*  But this policy would only be available to about 3% of the U.S. workforce, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=93.28s)]
*  or roughly 4 million people. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=97.88s)]
*  And not even everyone in that 3% would actually benefit, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=99.72s)]
*  because more than a third of tipped workers earn so little [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=103.24s)]
*  that they already don't pay federal income taxes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=106.36s)]
*  The standard deduction is the amount of money that you can make [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=109.12s)]
*  without having to pay any taxes at all. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=112.28s)]
*  For 2024, it's $14,600 for an individual and $29,200 for a married couple. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=114.44s)]
*  Tipped workers are also more likely to be teenagers and young adults under 25. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=120.92s)]
*  I think a lot of people rightly feel a lot of sympathy and support [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=125.44s)]
*  for people who work in what are hard, ruling jobs in the service industries. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=129.56s)]
*  The problem is the policy in practice, it won't achieve what I think we would like it to. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=134.24s)]
*  One of the issues economists have with the policy [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=139.32s)]
*  is that it would create unfair imbalances among low-wage workers. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=141.88s)]
*  One of the ways to make taxes fair is to make sure that people of the same income level [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=145.72s)]
*  are paying approximately the same amount of taxes. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  And in this case, you really wouldn't be doing that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=151.44s)]
*  So for example, if you took a delivery worker who delivered food, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=153.56s)]
*  they probably get tips, and so they would qualify for this tax benefit. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=157.44s)]
*  If you took a delivery worker who delivered packages, they usually don't. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=160.72s)]
*  So they wouldn't get a tax benefit. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=163.64s)]
*  But I can't think of a good reason why you would want to give a tax break [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=165.0s)]
*  to the person who delivers food, but not to the person who delivers mail. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=168.6s)]
*  Tipped workers represent a small percentage of those earning hourly wages. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  So the majority of low-wage workers wouldn't benefit from this tax cut. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=175.92s)]
*  Some experts say employers would actually stand to gain the most from this policy. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  Right now, employers are required by law to pay tipped workers $2.13 an hour in wages. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=184.76s)]
*  But if workers don't earn enough in tips to get them to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=191.16s)]
*  the employer has to pay the difference. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=197.48s)]
*  This would basically be a subsidy for that part of tipped workers' income. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=199.92s)]
*  If you create this subsidy, what you do is reduce the pressure to raise wages. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=204.2s)]
*  It would push more of the responsibility for paying people for the work they do [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=208.12s)]
*  onto the customers directly rather than the employers who are supposed to be footing those bills. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  This leads to another concern, that it would result in a culture of even more tipping. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=215.56s)]
*  According to a bank rate survey, many Americans view tipping negatively, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=220.8s)]
*  and 35% think tipping culture has gotten out of control. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=224.8s)]
*  Many policy experts worry this tax break would incentivize other industries to adopt a tipped model. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=228.84s)]
*  When you give someone a tax break for something, you're really encouraging that part of the economy, right? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=235.28s)]
*  And as a rule, I don't think we really want to encourage people's wages to be based on things like tips. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=240.44s)]
*  There's so many ways that we could be helping people in the service industry, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  and this seems more like a soundbite. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=248.60000000000002s)]
*  No tax on tips. Do we like that? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=250.4s)]
*  There's also some concern among economists that higher-income professionals like hedge fund managers and lawyers [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=254.48s)]
*  could structure their compensation in ways to try to take advantage of this tax break. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=259.92s)]
*  The Harris campaign says its policy would include income limits to avoid these types of abuses. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=264.48s)]
*  The Trump campaign hasn't said if its plan will include these types of guardrails. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=270.0s)]
*  Despite these red flags, this idea is gaining momentum in Congress. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=274.76s)]
*  I intend this coming week to introduce legislation exempting tips from federal income tax. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  Senator Ted Cruz's bill has no income cutoff [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=285.04s)]
*  and would provide a 100% deduction on federal income taxes for any earnings from tips. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=288.0s)]
*  I certainly wouldn't expect this legislation to pass standalone. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=293.64s)]
*  I think you might see it slip into a larger tax bill, and one of those is going to be on the table. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  Until a couple of months ago, this was a very low-profile idea, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=300.56s)]
*  not something that candidates or lawmakers are really talking about. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=303.0s)]
*  But now that you've got Vice President Harris and Donald Trump talking about it, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=306.52s)]
*  it's got that kind of bipartisan agreement. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=310.08s)]
*  We'll push this forward. We'll put it on the table in some way in 2025. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=312.35999999999996s)]
*  It's maybe not the most, you know, pristine, academically grounded kind of policy, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=316.56s)]
*  but it's a campaign. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0TBD-28VhE&t=322.12s)]
