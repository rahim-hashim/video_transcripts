Video Description: President Trump’s cryptocurrency meme coin $TRUMP has already earned him billions of dollars on paper, but this is one of the most controversial investments ever made by a commander-in-chief. Trump has a long history of cashing in on his personal brand through products like shoes, guitars and bibles, but to many in the crypto world, his meme coin ventures are his most naked and predatory money grab yet. Once a bitcoin skeptic, Trump has promised to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet.” 

WSJ explores why the Trump meme coin and Melania meme coin are so unprecedented and why they’re so controversial to the crypto industry.

# Why So Many Crypto Experts Hate Trump's Meme Coins | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ)
*  The Trump family's latest ventures, two new cryptocurrency meme coins, are a historic first for a sitting president. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And they're arguably the most controversial investments ever made by a commander in chief. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  I mean, this is just so... [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  This is bribery writ large. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=15.44s)]
*  It's historic in its grift. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=17.12s)]
*  Here's why Trump's meme coins are so unprecedented and why they're so controversial to the crypto industry. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=18.88s)]
*  If you like your steak, you'll absolutely love Trump's steaks. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=25.28s)]
*  Donald Trump has a long history of cashing in on his brand. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=29.84s)]
*  Today, you can buy collectible Trump trading cards, autographed Trump guitars, Trump 1 sneakers, and even Trump endorsed Bibles. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=33.36s)]
*  I encourage you to get this God-blessed USA Bible. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=42.16s)]
*  Now, Trump has his eye on the crypto market, but he hasn't always been a fan. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=45.6s)]
*  He once called Bitcoin a scam. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=49.92s)]
*  Do you ever dabble in Bitcoin or cryptos? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=52.56s)]
*  I don't. I like the currency of the United States. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  I think it's, you know, I think the others are potentially a disaster waiting to happen. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=59.68s)]
*  But by last summer, Trump had a change of heart, promising to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the planet. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=65.12s)]
*  Bitcoin and crypto will skyrocket like never before. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=71.28s)]
*  Under the Biden administration, the SEC sued some of the largest crypto companies and exchanges, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=76.08s)]
*  such as Coinbase Global and Binance. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=83.76s)]
*  A lot of crypto companies felt like they were singled out because of the failure of FTX. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=87.04s)]
*  They felt like they couldn't do business in the United States. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=94.4s)]
*  However, President Trump on the campaign trail promised that he would create more regulatory friendly environment. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=97.92s)]
*  Like many in the industry, Rob Haddock, a general partner at the crypto-focused investment firm Dragonfly, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  was optimistic about Trump's crypto policies. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=112.24s)]
*  Before the coins were launched, people around Donald Trump had talked on the campaign trail about [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  doing a lot of really awesome things to just encourage innovation here in the U.S. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=119.2s)]
*  and allow for an easier path for just participation in the industry. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=124.24s)]
*  Many of the promises Trump made on the campaign trail have already materialized. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  Trump has signed an executive order to create a national digital asset stockpile. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=133.68s)]
*  The president also pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, who was serving a life sentence [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=138.48s)]
*  for creating the underground online marketplace that used cryptocurrencies for transactions. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=143.76s)]
*  The openness to crypto from this administration to the last one is so different [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  that it is actually impossible for me to quantify. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=153.12s)]
*  There was no openness for the last two years of the Biden administration. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=155.2s)]
*  There was no engagement. There was only hostility. Now there is the exact opposite of that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  Trump announced the launch of his meme coin the same day his supporters [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=164.88s)]
*  hosted a crypto ball event for his inauguration. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=168.4s)]
*  The reign of terror against crypto is over. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=171.76s)]
*  The Trump coin launched at basically zero and in just a few hours it achieved a market value [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=177.76s)]
*  as high as 15 billion. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=186.0s)]
*  The Melania coin also skyrocketed hours after it launched, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=188.24s)]
*  achieving a market value as high as two billion dollars. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=192.08s)]
*  In the days since they peaked in value these coins have really declined sharply. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  As of February 11th, the Trump token was trading at $15.56, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  which represents a market cap of over three billion dollars. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  By contrast, the Melania coin was trading at $1.42, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=212.4s)]
*  which represents a market cap of about $212 million. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=217.28s)]
*  It is really hard to understate how significant the Trump and Melania meme coin are. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=222.08s)]
*  A lot of people's first reaction was like, oh, this actually can't be real. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=227.84s)]
*  Disbelief within the crypto community soon gave way to concern [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=232.0s)]
*  that the Trump family's meme coins could hurt the industry. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=235.84s)]
*  I was worried that this token would trade up and then trade down [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=239.28s)]
*  and it would be a loss of money and that would turn people off. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=243.12s)]
*  I was worried about how this might make crypto more partisan, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=245.52s)]
*  not less in a time where I'm trying to make it less partisan. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  GetTrumpMemes.com, the website associated with the Trump token, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=251.28s)]
*  said it isn't political and has nothing to do with any political campaign [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=255.44s)]
*  or any political office or governmental agency. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=259.76s)]
*  Another major point of controversy, 80% of the Trump token's supply [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=263.52s)]
*  is owned by Fight Fight Fight and CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump organization. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=267.92s)]
*  We don't quite know exactly what that ownership looks like, but theoretically, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=273.76s)]
*  people in and around the administration or the companies that Trump owns, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=278.24s)]
*  I'm worried about how they might decide to monetize or sell those tokens in the future. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  In response to a request for comment, Eric Trump, the executive vice president [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=287.68s)]
*  of the Trump organization, wrote, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=292.24s)]
*  The Trump meme coin is currently the hottest digital meme on earth, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=294.16s)]
*  and I truly believe that World Liberty Financial will revolutionize DeFi, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  C-Fi, and will be the future of finance. We are just getting started. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=302.48s)]
*  For a lot of crypto executives and investors, they have really been trying to rebuild [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=306.88s)]
*  their image and kind of create this image that crypto is a serious industry and a serious [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=313.52s)]
*  technology. However, the launch of these meme coins kind of speaks to the opposite of that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=320.8s)]
*  It's sort of saying that maybe the crypto industry is about speculative investments [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=328.48s)]
*  and risky bets. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=333.68s)]
*  Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is based largely on the popularity of [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=335.52s)]
*  internet memes. It serves no economic purpose. It has no business model. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=341.52s)]
*  Popular meme coins include Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, among others. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=347.36s)]
*  These meme coins are in a regulatory grade area. They are not necessarily being regulated in any [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=352.32s)]
*  jurisdictions. However, they may have broken some securities laws, commodities laws, or other [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=360.56s)]
*  financial regulations. One of the primary criticisms of meme coins is their susceptibility [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=367.44s)]
*  to pump and dump scams. In a pump and dump scheme, a coin of no inherent economic value [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  is hyped up online. That hype artificially pumps or inflates the value of the token, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=378.56s)]
*  which in turn attracts more buyers. The dump takes place when large holders sell their tokens, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=384.24s)]
*  which triggers a crash in the price. The sudden drop in price often leaves investors with [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=389.92s)]
*  worthless tokens, an act that is known in crypto parlance as a rug pull. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=395.04s)]
*  If I was advising the president and the administration, I would have advised them not to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  launch the meme coin. It's my belief that two things should not be true. One is that you [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=405.68s)]
*  shouldn't be able to profit off the office at least the time while you're in the office. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=410.64s)]
*  The other thing I am worried about, of course, is the appearance of or the ability for [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=413.44s)]
*  someone foreign to think that they can potentially have some sort of influence over whether it's [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=419.44s)]
*  President Trump himself or people that are close to him. Despite the industry's misgivings, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=424.8s)]
*  the meme tokens have already brought new individual investors to the crypto world. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=429.76s)]
*  Most holders of the meme tokens are small individual investors who have less than $100 [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=434.56s)]
*  worth of coins in their wallets. As of the week of February 3rd, the crypto forensic firm Chainalysis [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=439.76s)]
*  said that more than 810,000 wallets that held the Trump token had lost money. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJlGImGJPQ&t=446.8s)]
