# Why Most U.K Money Will Still Feature Queen Elizabeth II for Years to Come | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ)
*  One everyday item uniquely captures Queen Elizabeth's 70 years on the throne. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Money. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=6.4s)]
*  There are currently 4.7 billion banknotes and 29 billion coins in circulation in the UK with the Queen's face front and center. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=8.4s)]
*  The image is almost like a logo now, isn't it, of the UK and the state. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=16.68s)]
*  But now as Charles takes the reign, currency, along with several other items, stand to change. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Basically, the biggest thing is probably going to be the currency, which will take quite a number of years. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=26.88s)]
*  Here's why updating money may be a longer process than some of the other items that bear her name. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=32.6s)]
*  After seven decades, the Queen's presence is deeply ingrained in the UK, seen tangibly on stamps and post boxes, even on cookie and gin labels. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=39.44s)]
*  Some things like the national anthem have already been updated. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=48.2s)]
*  But currency is a longer process, as the previous precedent shows. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=56.8s)]
*  Coins for the new reign will shortly be turned out in quantity at the Royal Mint. Let's hope you'll soon get some. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=60.64s)]
*  Elizabeth became Queen in 1952, with her coronation the following year. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=66.44s)]
*  Coins in the UK began showing Elizabeth's portrait in 1953, according to the Royal Mint, the nation's coin supplier. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=71.36s)]
*  But it wasn't until 1956 that the Bank of England received permission from the UK Treasury to use the Queen's portrait on a banknote. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=77.72s)]
*  And it was another four years before the public saw the first note in hand. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=85.2s)]
*  While there's a long history of monarchs featured on coins, this made her the first British royal to have a photo featured on paper bills. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=89.08s)]
*  In historic England, one of the only ways that some of the commoners would even know what the monarch looked like was by having it on a coin. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=96.12s)]
*  Since Elizabeth's first note, the bank has revised it several times, adding new security features and updating the Queen's image. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=105.04s)]
*  Most recently, in an effort to extend the lifespan of its currency, the bank began printing polymer notes rather than paper ones. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=112.12s)]
*  That transition began in 2016 and will be complete by the end of September this year. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=119.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, the latest coin in the UK was unveiled in 2015. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=124.24s)]
*  The Royal Mint worked with the Queen on five portraits, with the latest created by artist Jodie Clark. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=128.0s)]
*  Quite a lot of departments sort of touched the project. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=132.96s)]
*  So once I finished with it, it'll go on to production. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=135.72s)]
*  And we not only do the drawing, we also sculpt the low relief sculpture, which is on the coin as well, which is going to stamp out all the coins. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=138.32s)]
*  A separate version of his design began appearing on Australian coins in 2019. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=148.72s)]
*  The effigy on Australian coins is called the Commonwealth effigy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=153.28s)]
*  It's actually a different portrait altogether. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=157.24s)]
*  Any Commonwealth country could use that portrait, but the UK one is exclusively for the UK. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=159.68s)]
*  Australia is just one of many Commonwealth countries whose currency bears the Queen's image. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=166.28s)]
*  But that doesn't guarantee Charles will take her place on those currencies. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=170.8s)]
*  Does Canada, does Australia, does New Zealand, does Belize still feel a need or interest in putting the king on its currency? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=174.60000000000002s)]
*  Does it want to update the Queen? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=185.52s)]
*  Most of Canada's currency has phased out the Queen, for instance, but they do leave her on the 20. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=187.16000000000003s)]
*  Andrew Lee, Australia's Assistant Prime Minister for Treasury, reiterated this point in a recent press conference. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=191.76s)]
*  As I understand it, the decision to include the Queen's face in the $5 note was about her personally rather than about her status as the monarch. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=197.39999999999998s)]
*  So that transition isn't automatic. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=207.39999999999998s)]
*  The Royal Australian Mint said that coins featuring the Queen will remain legal currency, but they will not release any new ones with her image in 2023. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  Still with 15 billion coins featuring the Queen in circulation and only 110 million new coins minted a year in Australia, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=217.16s)]
*  coins featuring the Queen will remain in circulation for many years to come. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=223.68s)]
*  Other Commonwealth countries have said they plan to continue using the Queen's image, like the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Bank of Canada. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  The Bank of England hasn't given any insight into its timeline for a note featuring Charles, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=234.08s)]
*  but it assured the public that current notes featuring the Queen will continue to be legal tender. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=238.44s)]
*  The Royal Mint already offers coins that feature King Charles on its website. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  Though these coins were made for his birthdays and are not in circulation. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=246.4s)]
*  As for how Charles' portrait may look, some have said that he will face left since the Queen faced right. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=249.96s)]
*  The short answer is tradition because you alternate sides apparently here in terms of which way the monarch is facing on the currency. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  More details are expected from the Bank of England following the 10-day morning period. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itR0KJB7CcQ&t=263.12s)]
