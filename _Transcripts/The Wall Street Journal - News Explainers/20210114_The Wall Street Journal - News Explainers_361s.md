# How Biden Plans to Tackle the $1.6 Trillion Student Loan Debt | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 14, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4)
*  Over the past decade, student loan debt has skyrocketed in the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=0.0s)]
*  By December 2020, 43 million Americans owed the government a collective $1.6 trillion. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=5.88s)]
*  That's putting pressure on President-elect Joe Biden. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  We know that in the 21st century, 12 years of schooling is not enough. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=15.16s)]
*  And that young people are getting crushed by the burden of student debt. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=20.8s)]
*  Democrats want Biden to issue an executive order to forgive some loans if a bill can't [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=24.84s)]
*  get through Congress. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=28.68s)]
*  But opponents say that would unfairly assist high-income earners while increasing the existing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=29.96s)]
*  burden on taxpayers. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=34.48s)]
*  What's happening is a lot of people are not sending in payments to the education department. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  About a third of the $1.6 trillion that's on the books currently is not going to get [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=41.4s)]
*  repaid, which basically means taxpayers are going to have to cover that somehow. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  So what will Joe Biden do? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=51.08s)]
*  First, he wants to bring back a policy sought by congressional Democrats early in the pandemic. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  The legislation passed by the Democratic House calls for immediate $10,000 forgiveness of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=58.84s)]
*  student loans. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=64.44s)]
*  It should be done immediately. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=65.6s)]
*  From there, Biden says he wants to start by revamping the existing forgiveness options [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=67.72s)]
*  offered by the federal government. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=72.34s)]
*  There are these programs in place called income-based repayment. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=74.28s)]
*  And the first of these was actually passed under the Clinton administration. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=77.68s)]
*  Bill Clinton actually liked the idea of having students actually pay a share of their income [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  each month rather than a fixed dollar amount. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=86.84s)]
*  One example of these programs is called REPAY, which stands for Revised Pay as You Earn. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  In REPAY plans, anyone who's struggling to pay their student loan can set a new minimum [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=94.72s)]
*  payment that is 10% of their income over $25,000. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=99.16s)]
*  If the borrower makes these payments on time for 20 to 25 years, the government will forgive [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  the remaining balance of the loan. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=108.28s)]
*  Now keep in mind this is 10% of your discretionary income, so for some people it might not make [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=110.2s)]
*  sense. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=115.28s)]
*  You're spending a lot of money, you know, and 10% actually might be higher than what [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=116.36s)]
*  your standard repayment is. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=120.48s)]
*  So you kind of have to look at it and see if it makes sense. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=121.92s)]
*  But anyone can do this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=124.2s)]
*  You're entitled to enroll in this program. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=127.0s)]
*  And a lot of people have. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=130.04s)]
*  Enrollment in this program has surged. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=131.04s)]
*  But there's a catch. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=133.08s)]
*  The forgiven balance of the loan is counted as income on your taxes. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=134.32s)]
*  You know, if you think about it, that tax bill can actually be really high. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=138.6s)]
*  If you, if it's, let's say you owe $100,000 at the end of that 20 year program, well, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=141.56s)]
*  that's $100,000 of income. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=147.08s)]
*  And so that could be thousands of dollars in a tax bill that you face right then and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=148.72s)]
*  there at the end at the end of your repayment plan. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=152.6s)]
*  Biden's proposal changes this program in a way that draws less money from borrowers. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=156.88s)]
*  The minimum payment rate for these plans would be reduced from 10% to 5% of a borrower's [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  income after their first $25,000 earned. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  And Biden wants to make it so that forgiven debt won't be taxed as income. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  Biden also wants to sweeten the terms of forgiveness for public sector workers like teachers, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=175.11999999999998s)]
*  military personnel, and also employees of nonprofits. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=180.55999999999997s)]
*  People in these career fields already have their debts forgiven tax free after 10 years [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=184.55999999999997s)]
*  of public service. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=188.67999999999998s)]
*  But Biden wants to relieve some of their debts on a shorter timeline. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  Biden has said that the current program isn't working as intended. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  There is a program that exists now under the law that forgives student loans for being [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=197.12s)]
*  able to engage in public service. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to institute that fundamental change in that so it's able to be available to everyone [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  that in fact is engaged. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=212.4s)]
*  It's not being very well managed right now. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=213.8s)]
*  So I'm going to do all of those things. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=215.72s)]
*  Some say that contractors are to blame for the management issues. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=217.44s)]
*  The contractors that the education department uses to deal with students who have student [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=220.72s)]
*  loans have gotten a lot of things wrong. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=226.32s)]
*  So what you've seen is there have been a lot of instances of where people thought that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  they were on track to get forgiveness and then they learned that they're not and they [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=233.64s)]
*  maybe have to start all over. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  So this program has turned out to be a mess and he wants to fix that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=238.84s)]
*  Members of both political parties think that the federal student loan program needs an [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=243.84s)]
*  update. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=247.64s)]
*  One of the big differences right now is on the Democratic side, they're saying cancel [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=248.64s)]
*  student debt right now and then we'll worry about reforming the program. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  Republicans are saying, wait a minute, the first thing we need to do is fix this program [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=256.2s)]
*  to solve the underlying problems in the first place. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=261.12s)]
*  Any student loan debt that's forgiven is covered by taxpayers. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=264.52000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Biden says he'll pay for expanded debt forgiveness by reversing parts of the tax [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=268.04s)]
*  cuts of 2017. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=272.44s)]
*  For a lot of his plans, he wants to raise taxes on higher owners, on our corporations, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=274.24s)]
*  corporate profits. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  So more broadly, he's talked about doing that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=280.52s)]
*  Another issue is who exactly benefits from expanded loan forgiveness programs. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=283.88s)]
*  Most student debt is actually held by people who are in upper income households. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=288.88s)]
*  The Brookings Institution shows that 60 percent of student debt, so more than half of the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=293.35999999999996s)]
*  1.6 trillion on the books, is held by people who are making $74,000 a year or more. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=299.2s)]
*  But if debts are forgiven, the smaller payouts given to lower income households are likely [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=306.76s)]
*  to have a bigger impact on that household's finances. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=311.08s)]
*  In recent years, roughly one in five student loan borrowers fell behind on their payments, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=314.68s)]
*  according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=319.4s)]
*  That's a sign that many remain at risk of default on their student loan, which could [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=322.24s)]
*  impact their credit or even lead to garnished wages. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=325.84s)]
*  If you look at the number of people that have defaulted on their loans, it's almost the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=328.48s)]
*  same as the number of people who lost their homes during the housing crash. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  This was almost unheard of, you know, in the early 2000s, that there would be someone calling [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=337.84s)]
*  for canceling student debt. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=343.08s)]
*  So it shows just how much of a middle-class anxiety this has become in just the past 10 [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=344.62s)]
*  years. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  And Biden hopes to relieve that anxiety over the debts in his first term. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weGiKga3h4&t=351.03999999999996s)]
