# Tech Decoupling China's Race to End Its Reliance on the U.S.  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE)
*  This is a chip. It's the brains of electronic devices, laptops, smartphones, TVs, and certainly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=0.0s)]
*  the device you're watching this video on right now. Almost half of these chips are sold globally [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  by American firms like Qualcomm and Intel. But now, China is racing to change that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=11.84s)]
*  The country has added almost $30 billion into its own semiconductor companies, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=18.56s)]
*  like Chinese manufacturer SMIC. SMIC is China's hope to win this tech race with the U.S. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=23.36s)]
*  SMIC is one of many little-known Chinese tech companies that saw their stocks rise earlier this [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=29.84s)]
*  year as the Trump administration announced a number of moves to effectively shut Chinese tech [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=34.88s)]
*  giants, including TikTok and Huawei, out of the U.S. market. Huawei is something that's very [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=40.16s)]
*  dangerous. I mean, Washington's attitude toward China, particularly when it comes to technology, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=46.32s)]
*  is that the two countries need to separate. We could wind up with two different ecosystems [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=51.68s)]
*  when it comes to technology. This separation process has been called decoupling. So how are [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=58.32s)]
*  the U.S. and China trying to become more self-sufficient and what does it mean for tech [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=63.92s)]
*  giants in both countries? We cannot take the security risks of any of those companies, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=68.24s)]
*  including Huawei, which as you know, we put a halt to. Huawei and the hugely popular video app TikTok [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=74.08s)]
*  have both been accused of being potential tools for Chinese espionage and have been labelled by [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=79.84s)]
*  the U.S. as a security threat. We want to see untrusted Chinese apps removed from U.S. app [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=84.88s)]
*  stores. President Trump has mentioned impending action on TikTok and for good reason. Both Huawei [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=90.08s)]
*  and TikTok have vehemently denied those allegations and said they operate independently from Chinese [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  government. This administration has broadened the notion of what national security is way beyond [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  any other administration. And when it comes to China, they define national security as data. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=107.36s)]
*  All Chinese technology is suspect, according to this administration. As TikTok received threats [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=113.68s)]
*  of being outright banned in the U.S. and the U.S. government said Huawei would be barred from buying [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=119.12s)]
*  chips from the U.S. and other countries, investment from China has almost ground to a halt. Chinese [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=124.0s)]
*  investment in the U.S. is down 90 some odd percent. The restrictions have also startled a number of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=130.16s)]
*  American companies, which have been lobbying hard against the changes. Huawei is a big client for [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=135.68s)]
*  corporations including Qualcomm and Intel. The likes of Microsoft Bill Gates and Alibaba's Jack [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=141.44s)]
*  Ma have said the recent escalations are counterproductive for both sides. American [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=147.2s)]
*  companies supply parts to Huawei that may all go away, all of it. I mean the Trump administration's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=152.64s)]
*  message to American companies and European companies that want to do business in China is [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=159.6s)]
*  don't do it, come to the U.S. So how is China responding? Beijing announced it would no longer [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=165.28s)]
*  allow its own artificial intelligence tech, think facial recognition and data processing, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=170.16s)]
*  to be exported without new licenses. Beijing also said it wanted to launch its own new set of global [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=175.2s)]
*  data rules. While Washington and Beijing are fighting on a number of fronts, from Hong Kong [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=181.6s)]
*  to Taiwan and the South China Sea, tech has emerged as a strategic priority. That's where companies like [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=186.72s)]
*  Smick come in. China has had a long-standing desire to reduce Chinese companies' dependence [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  on foreign supply. However, it's really not until the Trump's trade war that the Chinese leadership [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=200.8s)]
*  realized that this is really serious. We really need to put our act together now. China launched [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=208.56s)]
*  its own version of the Nasdaq last year, the Star Market, and stocks there have soared. It reflects [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=214.96s)]
*  how much investors think companies can benefit from the country's quest for self-reliance. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=220.56s)]
*  Under Xi Jinping, there's a new slogan. It's called domestic circulation. This esoteric slogan [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=225.36s)]
*  means that China going forward is going to prioritize its own companies, its own markets, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=232.8s)]
*  and Chinese consumption. Chips are particularly important. China is the world's biggest consumer [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=239.6s)]
*  of chips. It spends more on chips than it does on oil and imported $300 billion worth of chips last [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=245.92s)]
*  year. Policymakers are using Smick as a role model for other companies with similar ambitions. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  They're basically telling those companies, we're willing to invest in you, we're willing to help [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=259.12s)]
*  you, as long as you adhere to the policy agenda. Beijing is already touting a number of successes. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=264.4s)]
*  China's economy is forecast to be the only major economy to grow this year, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=271.6s)]
*  and that's benefiting its tech giants. Huawei, which is already a global champion in 5G technology, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  became the number one smartphone seller in July, mostly thanks to its domestic market, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  where it sells over 70% of its phones. But ending its reliance on US technology remains complicated. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=287.6s)]
*  You have a lot of really smart engineers and scientists on both sides of the Pacific. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=294.24s)]
*  If they are not working together, that will clearly retard innovation. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=298.96s)]
*  Huawei announced in 2019 that it can produce a phone without US chips. Still, those substitute [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=303.52s)]
*  parts are themselves made with American technology and tools, and the administration has taken steps [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=309.68s)]
*  to close the loophole. And if US regulation doesn't allow Huawei to buy key components made with US [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  tech, Huawei may simply not be able to produce its hardware. Analysts estimate that Huawei's stock [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  pile of US components will only last for one or two years. Huawei has declined to comment on its [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=327.28s)]
*  inventory. Huawei's situation is seen as a confirmation that despite heavy investment, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=333.28s)]
*  Chinese chip companies like SMIC are still lagging behind. While SMIC has said it aims [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  to accelerate the development of its own chip tech, for now, the company still relies on a lot [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=343.76s)]
*  of US technology. And as the Trump administration said it was considering placing restrictions on [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=349.2s)]
*  the semiconductor company, its shares tumbled. China is said to be about four years behind the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=354.72s)]
*  US and Taiwan. China has been here before. It has been trying to catch up with the US for decades, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=360.96000000000004s)]
*  and it's not the first time it has invested so heavily in semiconductor industry. However, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=367.76000000000005s)]
*  it still has a huge gap to fill, and now time is running short. And the US is also making moves. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=373.92s)]
*  Legislation is making its way through the US Senate that could pump an additional $37 billion [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=380.8s)]
*  into American semiconductor manufacturing and research and development. And whether or not [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=386.32000000000005s)]
*  Trump is re-elected, US actions aren't likely to stop. I don't think a Biden administration [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=391.12s)]
*  would take a fundamentally different view toward China. China would still be the number one [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=398.0s)]
*  competitor. There would still be issues on human rights, national security, technology. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=402.88000000000005s)]
*  No matter who's next in the White House, this kind of inward-turning policy China has is here [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=408.64s)]
*  to stay. China's leadership realises the US is no longer a reliable partner. So after years of [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=415.2s)]
*  escalating tensions between the US and China, the decoupling of their tech industries will now [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=422.64s)]
*  likely continue. I mean, what the US at the moment is doing is saying to the rest of the world, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  choose. You know, are you going to go with us or are you going to go with them? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFmBWiMxJE&t=433.68s)]
