# Why Big Tech Wants Access to Your Medical Records
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 09, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY)
*  Your medical records used to look like this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, 80% are digital, making your health information easier for people and businesses to access. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=5.0s)]
*  Let's say this is your electronic health record. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=14.0s)]
*  It contains information on your medical history, diagnoses, prescriptions, and lots more. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=19.0s)]
*  You might not expect tech giants like Amazon and Apple to be getting involved with your electronic health records. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=26.0s)]
*  But they are, along with smaller tech companies like Zelf. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=32.0s)]
*  And they're starting to use them to grow new businesses. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=36.0s)]
*  Here's how three companies are using our health data right now, and how they can dive deeper into our medical data in the future. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=39.0s)]
*  Let's start with Zelf. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=45.0s)]
*  They're a Seattle-based startup that recently developed an application that's embedded in a patient's electronic health record. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=47.0s)]
*  Here's how it works. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=53.0s)]
*  Medical professionals at hospitals that use Zelf create lists of products they think could be useful for their patients. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=55.0s)]
*  For example, they might come up with 30 different products or services that could be useful for any of their pregnant patients. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=61.0s)]
*  These can include everything from services like instructional videos and newsletters, to products like maternity belts, compression socks, and body pillows. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=68.0s)]
*  Then, Zelf adds these lists into their system. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=76.0s)]
*  If a doctor has a pregnant patient, they can pull up the recommended list of products and services for pregnant people while looking at that patient's medical record. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=80.0s)]
*  The doctor then goes through that list and selects which products and services they actually want to recommend to their pregnant patient. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=88.0s)]
*  From there, the doctor sends their patient a digital shopping list. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=95.0s)]
*  If the patient clicks on a product, they're directed to one of Zelf's 30 vendor sites, which include Amazon, Babyscripts, and Lyft, and given the option to buy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=99.0s)]
*  Some privacy experts worry that certain Zelf vendors can see when a patient purchased a product through Zelf, and therefore through their electronic health record. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=109.0s)]
*  In theory, it could boost adherence to physician recommendations, which is a huge challenge in the U.S. health care system. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=118.0s)]
*  On the other side, there are real worries about what type of information Amazon, in particular, is getting access to. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=127.0s)]
*  So from what I understand is that when a patient clicks on that Zelf app and is taken to Amazon, the data is coded as Zelf data, which means that Amazon likely knows that you purchased those products through your electronic health record. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=134.0s)]
*  Next up is Amazon. In addition to the tech giant's connection to Zelf, it started selling its own software that uses artificial intelligence to mine patients' electronic health records. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=151.0s)]
*  It's called Amazon Comprehend Medical, and it's part of the company's cloud computing service. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=161.0s)]
*  The software is sold to hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, researchers, and other health care providers. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=166.0s)]
*  This helps doctors and researchers identify trends that humans may not notice. Here's how it works. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=171.0s)]
*  Hospitals and other users upload portions of their patients' medical data to Amazon Web Services. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=177.0s)]
*  The software then analyzes the data and is then presented to doctors in the form of something similar to an Excel spreadsheet. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=182.0s)]
*  By using keywords, doctors can sift through tons of patients' data to find strong candidates for research studies. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=188.0s)]
*  If they're looking for people with melanoma who also have a family history of cancer, they can do this in seconds, where it used to take hours. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=194.0s)]
*  While studies acknowledge the potential benefits of electronic health records in that they could help researchers find cures for diseases, they also stress the potential for inaccuracies, noting coding problems or doctors entering wrong information. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=201.0s)]
*  I think it's also very important to be transparent around the limitations of big data and machine learning and natural language processing and other types of AI that we're using to analyze the data. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=214.0s)]
*  And so right now, there are serious concerns about the quality of data. So, for example, my OBGYN electronic health records said I was male and I was pregnant at the time. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=226.0s)]
*  Finally, Apple is using the iPhone's Health app to make medical records easier to access. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=237.0s)]
*  The Health Records feature is located in the app, and it imports your medical information directly from your health care provider. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=243.0s)]
*  This includes everything from information on allergies, immunizations, lab results, medications, and even vitals. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=249.0s)]
*  There are already more than 150 participating health care institutions. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=255.0s)]
*  The idea is to give an American iPhone user the ability to pull up their medical record on their phone and present it to a doctor anywhere in the world. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=260.0s)]
*  The move by Apple is just one example of how it's recently made inroads into health care. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=268.0s)]
*  In 2016, the company added a feature to the Health app that allows users to sign up to be an organ donor. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=273.0s)]
*  And earlier this year, Apple Watch added a new electrical heart sensor feature, which has been cleared by the FDA. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=279.0s)]
*  So as companies continue to use our electronic health records, what does this mean for our privacy? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=286.0s)]
*  Amazon and Apple say they can't use or view the information. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=290.0s)]
*  They also say it's encrypted, which helps prevent our health records from getting hacked. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=294.0s)]
*  In addition, HIPAA has security rules that protect individuals' electronic health information, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=298.0s)]
*  making our medical records some of the most difficult personal data to access. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=303.0s)]
*  In spite of this, Dr. Dudley Adams, a data use expert, doesn't think this is enough. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=307.0s)]
*  No encryption is perfect. All it takes is time to eventually get through the encryption. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=313.0s)]
*  The thing people are most worried about, about having their health records hacked, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=317.0s)]
*  is that then people will sell that information to insurance companies or employers so that they can avoid sick people. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=323.0s)]
*  And that hacking can mean that suddenly your private information makes you unemployable or uninsurable. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=332.0s)]
*  Privacy experts also stress the need for openness as companies move deeper into our electronic health records. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=338.0s)]
*  So the more that the companies can be transparent about these things, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=343.0s)]
*  the less of a black box and perhaps the more appropriate trust we can build in the system. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=347.0s)]
*  So whether or not privacy concerns outweigh the potential research benefits, one thing's for sure. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=352.0s)]
*  This is just the beginning of companies tapping into our health data. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=357.0s)]
*  There's just going to be so much opportunity to make money because there's so much money. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=361.0s)]
*  So much money. $3 trillion are spent on health care every year. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auwP7tJtMkY&t=365.0s)]
