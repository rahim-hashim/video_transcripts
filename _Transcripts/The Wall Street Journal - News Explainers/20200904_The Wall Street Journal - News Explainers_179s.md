# How Future Blood Shortages Could Be Solved in the Lab | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 04, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU)
*  The coronavirus pandemic has led to shortages around the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=0.0s)]
*  And in the early days of the pandemic, we ran into one particularly concerning shortage. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=5.76s)]
*  We didn't have enough blood. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=10.88s)]
*  Blood drives across the country were canceled, leading to more than one million donations [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=12.96s)]
*  going uncollected. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  So when we run low on blood, is there a backup? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=19.16s)]
*  Not yet, but researchers have been working on a solution for the future by producing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=22.76s)]
*  blood in their labs. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=27.32s)]
*  Blood can be complex to replicate because it's made up of different parts. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=30.32s)]
*  Red blood cells that carry oxygen, white blood cells to fight infection, plasma that carries [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=34.6s)]
*  nutrients and proteins and transports blood cells, and platelets that help your blood [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=40.32s)]
*  clot. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  A lot of the momentum in the field is with labs trying to grow their own platelets. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=46.56s)]
*  How do they do that? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=51.28s)]
*  They use stem cells. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=52.28s)]
*  Those are cells that have the ability to make other cells. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=54.04s)]
*  Scientists have previously tried out different types of stem cells, but there was a huge [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=58.28s)]
*  breakthrough in 2006 when a researcher found a way to turn mature cells in the body into [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=62.04s)]
*  a pluripotent stem cell. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=68.08s)]
*  That is, a stem cell that can create almost any other cell. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=69.92s)]
*  It's like if you use different kinds of building blocks to make this big castle, then [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  revert that castle back to a single block. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  And then you can tweak that block, multiply it and build a completely different structure. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=80.94s)]
*  This Nobel Prize-winning discovery prompted researchers to change their work so they could [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=85.94s)]
*  use these special cells. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=90.22s)]
*  So how do you go from stem cell to platelet? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=92.94s)]
*  First you need to grow them into what's called a megakaryocyte. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=95.98s)]
*  It's the huge cell that produces platelets in the body. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=99.34s)]
*  Typically scientists take the pluripotent stem cells and activate certain regions of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=102.94s)]
*  coax them into becoming a megakaryocyte. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=108.38s)]
*  Then they mix the megakaryocytes with fluid, causing the cells to multiply. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=111.74s)]
*  And finally, they produce platelets. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=116.6s)]
*  But they had difficulty producing enough platelets until one research group unlocked a solution. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=119.52s)]
*  They created a bioreactor. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=125.22s)]
*  It's like an 8-liter French press which works by keeping the megakaryocytes moving, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=127.22s)]
*  and it allows them to produce billions of platelets. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=132.62s)]
*  In other words, enough for a transfusion. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=135.88s)]
*  Most of this work is currently being done in labs, but these platelets have been tried [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=139.56s)]
*  out on one human subject in a clinical trial in Japan. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=143.7s)]
*  Right now, the technology is expensive. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=148.46s)]
*  It can cost labs tens of thousands of dollars to make one bag of platelets. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=151.28s)]
*  But researchers have a vision for a more scalable solution. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=156.12s)]
*  Platelet factories. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=159.98s)]
*  Researchers hope that in the future, manufactured blood could help deliver critical therapies, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=162.72s)]
*  support areas of the world where the blood supply runs low, or be used as a backup during [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=167.78s)]
*  global emergencies. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDTpVYZaUuU&t=173.5s)]
