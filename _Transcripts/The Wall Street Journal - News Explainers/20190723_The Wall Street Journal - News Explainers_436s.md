# What Is (and Isn't) Medicare for All  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 23, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44)
*  During the first Democratic presidential debates in June, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=0.0s)]
*  moderator Lester Holt asked the same question to both sets of candidates. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=3.6s)]
*  Who here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government-run plan? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=8.0s)]
*  This question was referring to Medicare for All, a proposal by Senator Bernie Sanders [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=14.4s)]
*  that would create a new federally run health care system and make the U.S. government [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  the sole provider of health insurance in the United States. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=24.1s)]
*  Under Senator Sanders' plan, most employees sponsored private insurance would be eliminated, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=28.1s)]
*  and Medicare would be replaced with an entirely new program, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=33.1s)]
*  one that covers health care costs for every single person in the United States. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=36.7s)]
*  This question about private insurance has dominated the presidential debate on the left. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=41.7s)]
*  All candidates say they want universal health care, meaning they want every American covered, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=46.900000000000006s)]
*  but they're split on how to get there. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=51.8s)]
*  Just look at how they answered the question. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=54.1s)]
*  Senators Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, and Senator Elizabeth Warren [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=56.5s)]
*  all raised their hands to say they would eliminate private insurance. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=62.0s)]
*  But several co-sponsors of Medicare for All legislation from both the House and Senate [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=65.8s)]
*  were on stage both nights and didn't raise their hands. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=70.1s)]
*  And Kamala Harris walked back her answer after the debate by saying she misunderstood the question. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=73.3s)]
*  That's because several candidates have expressed concerns about Medicare for All [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=78.9s)]
*  and are embracing different approaches to universal coverage, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=83.19999999999999s)]
*  showing that this debate isn't just Medicare for All or nothing. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  We're going to explain what Medicare for All is, what it isn't, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  and what other Democratic health care proposals would do to health insurance in the United States. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=95.1s)]
*  The problem surrounding the conversation around Medicare for All is that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=102.1s)]
*  many people really just don't understand what Medicare for All means. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=105.3s)]
*  So while Medicare for All really does kind of refer to one specific broad idea, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=108.6s)]
*  there are a lot of percolating ways to get there that have been kind of carried under the umbrella of Medicare for All. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=114.1s)]
*  You can think of health care as a spectrum. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=120.89999999999999s)]
*  On one side you have Medicare for All's single-payer system, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=123.89999999999999s)]
*  and on the other side you have private insurance. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=127.1s)]
*  The current system in the United States falls in between the two, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=129.5s)]
*  with a mix of private and government-sponsored insurance that operate alongside each other. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=132.5s)]
*  Democrats have gotten themselves boxed into this corner [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  about whether their health plans would get rid of private insurance. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  That's kind of been the issue that has taken over the general focus. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=145.39999999999998s)]
*  This is significant because the vast majority of Americans have private health insurance. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=148.7s)]
*  A little more than 156 million Americans receive employer-sponsored insurance through work. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=153.2s)]
*  And private health insurance covers over one-third of all medical costs in the United States. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=159.29999999999998s)]
*  Medicare for All would introduce public insurance that would muscle out employer-sponsored insurance over four years. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=165.1s)]
*  It would also cover the uninsured, creating a single-payer system by leaving very little room for what private insurance could offer. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=171.9s)]
*  The question about whether your health plan would get rid of private plans has taken up a lot of air in the room. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=178.7s)]
*  In fact, if you look at other countries, the vast majority have a system that still allows for private plans for supplemental coverage. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=184.5s)]
*  Medicare for All would ban most private insurance from offering the same coverage as the government. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=192.0s)]
*  But England has a universal health care system that allows private insurance to offer duplicate coverage. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=197.3s)]
*  This private insurance provides access to private hospitals and reduces wait times for certain treatments. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=202.9s)]
*  Senator Sanders has pointed to Canada's health care system as a model his plan would emulate. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=208.7s)]
*  But Canada has a private insurance industry that offers supplemental health insurance to cover things the government doesn't, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=213.5s)]
*  like vision and dental care. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  About two-thirds of Canadians have supplemental private health insurance. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=222.2s)]
*  Medicare for All would be more expansive than its Canadian counterpart, covering dental and vision services. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=226.5s)]
*  The only out-of-pocket expense would be a copay on prescription drugs that would be capped at $200 per year. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=232.7s)]
*  Patients with government-funded insurance in both France and Australia also incur some sort of out-of-pocket cost. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=239.6s)]
*  But private health insurance is available in both places to cover these costs. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=246.4s)]
*  About 95% of people in France have this complementary private insurance in addition to government insurance. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=250.8s)]
*  Under the, for example, plan by Senator Bernie Sanders, it does have a very, very limited role for private insurance, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=257.9s)]
*  more limited than what you would see in other countries. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=265.5s)]
*  A big question about Medicare for All is how you pay for it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=268.5s)]
*  The idea that has been proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders does have some ideas attached to it, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=271.8s)]
*  no specific funding mechanism, but it looks at a progressive tax, a tax on companies. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=277.4s)]
*  He has said that taxes would increase overall to pay for the plan. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=283.09999999999997s)]
*  Yes, they will pay more in taxes, but less in health care for what they get. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Senator. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=292.2s)]
*  There's a lot of other plans out there that Democrats are supporting, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=293.4s)]
*  including options that would let everybody or limited number of people buy into a plan like Medicare. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=297.70000000000005s)]
*  I believe we need to get to universal health care as a right, not a privilege, to single payer. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  The quickest way you get there is you create competition with the insurers. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=309.90000000000003s)]
*  While Medicare for All aggressively builds a new single payer system from the ground up, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=313.90000000000003s)]
*  other plans expand the existing Medicare program to cover everyone in the U.S. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=318.3s)]
*  Those ideas are considered more of a stepping stone to this idea of universal health care [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=323.6s)]
*  that the Democrats do support as their overall goal. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=329.0s)]
*  Under these plans, private insurance remains. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=332.5s)]
*  The Medicare for America Act automatically enrolls the uninsured and newborns into Medicare [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=335.2s)]
*  but allows employers to continue to offer private insurance. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=339.8s)]
*  However, workers can also choose to enroll in Medicare. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=343.5s)]
*  Premiums would remain, but with caps, and those close to the poverty line would receive subsidies. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=347.3s)]
*  The CHOOSE Medicare Act allows Medicare to be bought through health care exchanges set up by the ACA. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=353.8s)]
*  Private insurance could remain as long as it was gold-level coverage, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=359.8s)]
*  a level of coverage where insurance covers 80% of costs. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=363.3s)]
*  Out-of-pocket costs would be capped at $7,900 per year. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=367.5s)]
*  The goal would be to level the playing field and make private insurance compete with a public option. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=371.1s)]
*  Some of the research that has been done on Medicare buying plans do show that the premiums for these [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=375.6s)]
*  would be lower than what's currently offered on the individual markets. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=381.3s)]
*  One of the hope of supporters of some of these buying options is that because they would be more affordable, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=385.9s)]
*  that more people would buy into these plans, they would find them palatable, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=392.4s)]
*  they would find them things they could afford, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=396.3s)]
*  and this would be a kind of slow on-ramp toward a universal health care system or Medicare for all. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=398.2s)]
*  This is really the first time in our country's history that we are looking at a total revamp [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=405.4s)]
*  of the US health care system, and it's the first time it's become really part of the public debate. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=411.1s)]
*  It could affect you, the consumer, it could affect how much you pay out-of-pocket, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  your ability to get access and coverage. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=421.5s)]
*  Even after the election, no matter who wins, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=423.70000000000005s)]
*  this is going to be an issue that continues to get debated for quite some time. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvP1IaI8m44&t=426.3s)]
