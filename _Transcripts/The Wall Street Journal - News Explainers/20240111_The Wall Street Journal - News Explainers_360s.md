Video Description: The Red Sea is one of the most important shipping waterways in the world, but the Israel-Hamas War has helped it also become one of the most dangerous. The Bab-el Mandeb Strait, or the Gate of Tears, is a vital passageway for ships traveling through the Suez Canal, but recent attacks from Houthis are creating a major maritime choke point. 

WSJ explains how the cargo industry is responding to try and guard against attacks from the Houthis in Yemen.

# Why This Shipping Route Is One of the World’s Most Dangerous | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA)
*  This strait is called the Barah Mandab, meaning the Gate of Tears. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=0.0s)]
*  Vessels have to go through the passage to get to the Suez Canal, which handles about [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=6.2s)]
*  12% of world trade and is a major maritime choke point. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=10.76s)]
*  But this is also one of the most dangerous shipping areas on the globe. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  In the months following the Hamas-Israel War, a commercial ship was hijacked here, another [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=20.5s)]
*  was targeted by a drone here, and these circles represent other attacks by militants on boats [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=25.88s)]
*  in the strategic zone. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=31.64s)]
*  Avoiding it means adding thousands of nautical miles by travelling around the Cape at the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=34.04s)]
*  bottom of Africa, an expensive and time-consuming venture. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=38.28s)]
*  Instead, some vessels are looking to bolster security to avoid disruption in the Red Sea [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=42.72s)]
*  and mitigate against delays that could see consumer prices rise. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=48.16s)]
*  Here's how. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=52.56s)]
*  Militant attacks on commercial vessels in the Key Waterway have been launched by the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=55.6s)]
*  Houthis, an Iran-backed militant group in Yemen. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=59.36s)]
*  The Houthis are using positions next to the Barah Mandab to target merchant vessels, and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  what it says is a response to the Hamas-Israel War. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=68.88s)]
*  They have attacked boats with missiles, with drones, and in one case actually seized a [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=72.36s)]
*  boat in a very dramatic heist. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=77.92s)]
*  This bodycam footage shows the moment armed militants land a helicopter on the deck of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=80.12s)]
*  a cargo ship before storming into the bridge. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=85.04s)]
*  The vessel was travelling on the Red Sea, a vital passage for shipping goods through [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  the Suez Canal from Asia into Europe to the rest of the world. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=93.56s)]
*  More than 20 per cent of all the containers that move around the world by sea go through [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=98.92s)]
*  Suez, about 10 per cent of crude oil, lots of cars, chemicals, liquefied natural gas, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=102.44000000000001s)]
*  all sorts. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=108.44000000000001s)]
*  But the attacks led major shipping companies including NASK and Harpac Lloyd to suspend [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=109.44000000000001s)]
*  operations in the area. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=114.72s)]
*  Instead, they are sending ships via the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=116.84s)]
*  However, this route is much longer and costs more in fuel, taking on average 43 days, resulting [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=121.6s)]
*  in higher prices for businesses. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=129.12s)]
*  The Red Sea routes, by contrast, take 34 days. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=131.66s)]
*  In any war or conflict involving countries with a coastline, shipping companies are faced [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=135.6s)]
*  with a question, do they want to keep on operating in those waters or not? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=142.60000000000002s)]
*  And this is a dangerous industry at times, but some people risk the gauntlet and can [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  be rewarded for doing so. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  Merchant ships travelling through the region on both routes have faced danger before. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=154.0s)]
*  This Saudi-owned oil tanker was hijacked far off the coast of Kenya by pirates in 2008. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=159.52s)]
*  It came amid a spate of other attacks by Somali pirates, complicating Red Sea shipping [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=167.12s)]
*  lanes and forcing the industry to bolster defences. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=172.24s)]
*  Vessels constructed barbed wire fencing, dispersed water cannons and installed high-pitched acoustic [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=176.8s)]
*  devices. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=183.44s)]
*  Others even worked with floating arsenals, where weaponry could be picked up en route. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=184.44s)]
*  But those defences will be largely useless against the attacks being launched by the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=192.12s)]
*  Houthis. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=196.24s)]
*  It's the first time that merchant vessels have been targeted by anti-ship ballistic [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=197.24s)]
*  missiles, according to US officials. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=202.32s)]
*  Some are taking precautions to try and reduce the danger. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=205.6s)]
*  Some for example are turning off their AIS signals. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=209.6s)]
*  Those are trackers used on vessels to be visible to each other during navigation. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=213.12s)]
*  By turning them off, vessels are trying to remain undetected. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=218.08s)]
*  Others have changed their destination signal to a message saying armed guards on board. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=222.68s)]
*  Shipping companies are also turning to security analysts for advice on dealing with another [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=229.88000000000002s)]
*  new threat, drone attacks. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=234.62s)]
*  This is a revolution in the nature of war that played out in Ukraine and is now at play [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=237.44s)]
*  in the Red Sea as well. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  One possible measure is learning how to spot drones as they're incoming early so that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  a ship could then sail to a safe location. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=247.68s)]
*  But for now, one of the safest ways for vessels to travel through the waterway is to lean [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=252.12s)]
*  on help from allied militaries. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=257.16s)]
*  A US-led multinational task force moved to the area in December to escort vessels and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=259.56s)]
*  shoot down projectiles. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=266.08s)]
*  However, attacks continued. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=268.36s)]
*  This footage released by the Israeli military is said to show a Houthi target flying over [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=271.8s)]
*  the Red Sea. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=276.92s)]
*  US officials said among the challenges to striking Houthi targets is that many of their [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=277.92s)]
*  weapons systems are mobile. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=283.32s)]
*  That's leading to fears of widespread disruption to trade flows that could worsen inflation [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=286.08000000000004s)]
*  by boosting prices for goods and energy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=291.44s)]
*  Ultimately, if it continues, it will lead to higher prices. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  The ships that, for example, move containers, they've been tied up for longer on these voyages, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=299.04s)]
*  So the shipping companies are already charging more per day to charge out their boats to [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=304.12s)]
*  move containers and that will feed through to consumers that there's no way that this [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=309.04s)]
*  gets absorbed by the supply chain. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=313.2s)]
*  The US is looking at different options to try and end the trouble in the waterway. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=315.04s)]
*  One is a more forceful military response, measures that could take out the Houthis' [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=321.04s)]
*  military capabilities at their root. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=326.16s)]
*  Another is diplomacy. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=328.28s)]
*  A lot of people say that ultimately the best way to stop this becoming a crisis is to pursue [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=329.28s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, a key US partner in the Middle East, for example, is in talks with the Houthis [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=334.32s)]
*  about ending the civil war in Yemen. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=340.0s)]
*  Halting attacks in the Red Sea and in turn helping the world continue with global trade [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=343.0s)]
*  could be another item on the agenda during those negotiations. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve7Yatn4cXA&t=349.12s)]
