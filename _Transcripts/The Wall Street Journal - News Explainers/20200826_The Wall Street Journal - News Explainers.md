# Durable Goods and What They Say About the Economy  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 26, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U)
*  The U.S. manufacturing sector continued its rebound in July. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's a way to see that, a chart showing new orders for goods that typically last three years or longer. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=5.0s)]
*  After declining sharply following coronavirus lockdowns, new orders rose to about $230.7 billion in July, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=11.5s)]
*  but still remain below pre-pandemic levels. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=19.5s)]
*  Counting new orders for long-lasting goods can reveal whether manufacturing activity is expanding or contracting. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=22.5s)]
*  That can point toward changes in the economy's recovery. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=29.0s)]
*  It gives you a sense of where things are headed. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=32.0s)]
*  So it counts orders that, in a lot of cases, that retailers make to manufacturers. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=34.0s)]
*  So if you're a retailer, a major retailer, and you're ordering a bunch of products, say a bunch of dishwashers, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=40.0s)]
*  that's because you're pretty confident you're going to be able to sell them pretty soon. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=46.0s)]
*  The first thing to know about the Durable Goods Indicator is what it measures. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=50.5s)]
*  The number begins with a survey of about 3,100 manufacturing companies across 92 categories in the United States. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=54.5s)]
*  The businesses report on how many new orders they filled to produce longer-lasting, durable goods. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=61.0s)]
*  There are two types of goods. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=67.0s)]
*  Non-durables are consumed quickly, like paper, food, or gasoline. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=69.0s)]
*  And then there are durables. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=74.0s)]
*  That count includes construction materials like lumber. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=76.0s)]
*  It also includes firearms, office chairs, tape measures, and computer hard drives. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=79.5s)]
*  It includes DSLR cameras and VR headsets. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=84.5s)]
*  Medical equipment like electrocardiography machines or gurneys are durable goods too, as are pieces of fine jewelry and books. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=87.5s)]
*  It also includes items that are really expensive and aren't purchased that often. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=96.0s)]
*  Products like heavy machinery. For example, these conveyor belts are durable goods. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=101.0s)]
*  Economists track the increase or decrease in the new orders on a month-to-month basis. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=106.5s)]
*  If more new orders come in this month than the last, that could point toward an economic expansion. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=111.5s)]
*  That's because one new durable goods order can signal future activity. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=117.0s)]
*  To see that in action, here's an example. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=121.0s)]
*  A farm might need to purchase a tractor, so it places an order. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=124.0s)]
*  The tractor manufacturing company then places orders with a number of other companies who produce parts like engines, windshields, and lights. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=129.0s)]
*  Each of those suppliers sends orders to manufacturers for raw materials and other durable goods. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=137.0s)]
*  The indicator can also capture the ripple effects from a bigger national trend, like housing sales. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=144.0s)]
*  Suppose say home sales are doing really well, like it turns out they are right now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=150.0s)]
*  It's conceivable, it's possible that a bunch of people are going to start buying long-lasting appliances for their homes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=153.0s)]
*  And that in turn will cause the retailers with these long-lasting appliances to order more from manufacturers. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=160.0s)]
*  The Durable Goods Survey captures the manufacturing activity that's connected to business activity. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=167.0s)]
*  In this case, the purchase of a home. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=173.0s)]
*  Many manufacturers track these new orders and send the data to the Census Bureau. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=176.0s)]
*  Most of the manufacturers in the survey have $500 million or more in annual shipments, but it also includes some smaller firms to make the sample more representative. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=182.0s)]
*  Economists, investors, and analysts watch for changes in the numbers, which are released monthly. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=193.0s)]
*  The main use really is it feeds into the GDP reports, which is this very obviously very close-seed blotched indicator. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=199.0s)]
*  Durable goods can provide early insight into economic patterns, but the indicator is not without flaws. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=206.0s)]
*  Of the many items that are counted in this survey, some are outweighed and can obscure changes elsewhere in manufacturing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=212.0s)]
*  One thing to keep in mind about the Durable Goods Report is that it's very volatile and the sources of volatility are things like aircraft. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=219.0s)]
*  To see a better proxy for business investments, you can look at the non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=226.0s)]
*  It's a subsection of the Durable Goods Survey. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=232.0s)]
*  That gives you a better sense of kind of the trend, which is really what we're looking for here. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=234.0s)]
*  Excluding aircraft makes a significant difference in the data. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=239.0s)]
*  For example, in some cases, a new Boeing jetliner can cost between $50 million to over $200 million, and its supply chain stretches to over 12,000 companies. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=243.0s)]
*  But production of new Boeing planes has stalled following two fatal 737 MAX crashes and a pandemic-driven collapse in air travel. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=253.0s)]
*  500 jet orders were canceled this year alone, and new orders have slowed to a trickle. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=261.0s)]
*  Boeing's troubles have overshadowed other manufacturing activity, which skewed the Durable Goods Survey results. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=267.0s)]
*  It made the Durable Goods Number look very strange because you had all these aircraft orders that weren't coming in. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=273.0s)]
*  So, you know, a few major categories like that can really skew the results. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=278.0s)]
*  Public spending on defense can do the same. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=282.0s)]
*  Things that the military buys are also included in this report. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=285.0s)]
*  So if the Pentagon puts in an order for a bunch of fighter jets or a bunch of tanks or something like that, you know, that shows up in the report. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=288.0s)]
*  It's hugely expensive. It will really sort of bump up the numbers for that month. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=295.0s)]
*  But it doesn't really tell you a whole lot about the overall state of the economy. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=300.0s)]
*  It's just the Pentagon has made a bunch of orders for tanks. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=304.0s)]
*  The Durable Goods Survey captures ripples of economic activity across manufacturing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=306.0s)]
*  But economists look beyond the headline number for a more meaningful view of where things are headed. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1uV-5h87U&t=311.0s)]
