Video Description: A volcano in southwest Iceland erupted after weeks of intense earthquake activity and the evacuation of thousands from the area. The Reykjanes Peninsula is experiencing a fissure eruption instead of an explosive eruption, where lava is basically oozing from cracks in the ground. This runny magma can severely damage infrastructure as it can widely spread across the landscape.

WSJ explains the science of fissure eruptions and the particular dangers they pose to the Reykjanes Peninsula in Iceland.

# Why Iceland’s Latest Volcanic Eruption Looks So Different | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0)
*  These are some of the scenes in the Reckonis Peninsula of Iceland after a volcanic eruption [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=0.0s)]
*  began expelling lava in the region. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=7.84s)]
*  This style of eruption differs somewhat from the kind of popular culture explosions that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=11.08s)]
*  you might see. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=17.0s)]
*  Here's why this eruption looks so different and what threats it poses. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=23.52s)]
*  It is home to more than 130 volcanoes across more than 30 volcanic systems. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=28.92s)]
*  And right now, lava is erupting out of the Svartzengi volcanic system, located in the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  Reckonis Peninsula of southwest Iceland. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=39.84s)]
*  In a traditional volcano, the volcanic material funnels through a central vent typically, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=42.72s)]
*  like in those volcanoes that you ideate in Hollywood, where there is a mountain and a [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  conical peak and the summit and everything flows out of the summit, whether that's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=54.88s)]
*  an ash boom that explodes explosively into the sky or whether the lava comes up and out [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  of the center and leaks down the side of the mountain. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=64.56s)]
*  Here, it's not like that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=66.88s)]
*  Instead, in this type of eruption, known as a fissure eruption, lava basically oozes from [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=68.72s)]
*  cracks in the ground. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=73.92s)]
*  And the type of lava typically involved in these two kinds of eruptions also looks different. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=76.12s)]
*  An explosive eruption is often due to viscous, sticky magma that doesn't flow easily, while [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=81.36s)]
*  a fissure eruption pushes out fluid and runny magma that spreads across the landscape. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  The big danger with these is that these lava flows can spread out quite a long way. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  And obviously, as we're seeing in Iceland right now, that poses a threat to both the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  infrastructure in the region and people's lives. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=103.02s)]
*  The eruption from the Svartseingi volcanic system occurred near Grindavík, an Icelandic [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=106.96s)]
*  fishing town. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=111.52s)]
*  The surrounding area is home to a major airport, one of the country's most popular tourist [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=112.63999999999999s)]
*  attractions, the Blue Lagoon, and a power plant that provides hot water for the majority [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=117.36s)]
*  of the peninsula. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=122.16s)]
*  Eruptions in this part of Iceland have been increasing steadily in recent years, after [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=126.08s)]
*  a very long dormant period. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=130.0s)]
*  This is just an area of Iceland that goes through these periodic eras of on-and-off [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=132.32s)]
*  eruption activity and then quiescence. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=138.68s)]
*  So like around a millennia or so, the peninsula is quiet. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=141.28s)]
*  You don't see volcanic activity. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=144.76s)]
*  And then it starts up. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=146.9s)]
*  And then that era of volcanic activity lasts for centuries. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=151.4s)]
*  Iceland sits on top of the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates, making it a hotbed [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=156.68s)]
*  of seismic and volcanic activity. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=161.56s)]
*  When the tectonic plates slip past one another, earthquakes occur. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=164.48s)]
*  And as the plates spread apart, magma can leak up to the surface, generating volcanic [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=168.28s)]
*  eruptions. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=172.83999999999997s)]
*  The focus of sort of monitoring efforts of volcanic systems is around trying to identify [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  as early as possible any precursory signals that sort of come before the onset of an eruption. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=179.88s)]
*  And in instances like what we're seeing in Iceland, these eruptions are typically heralded [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=187.23999999999998s)]
*  by these sort of really high levels of seismic activity to try and really tell us where there [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  might be an eruption and sort of where ongoing intrusions are going. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=200.16s)]
*  It remains to be seen how the lava erupting from the Svartseingi volcanic system will [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=206.32s)]
*  impact residents in the surrounding area. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  But the risk of volcanic activity also comes with benefits for the Icelandic community. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=213.76s)]
*  Every expert from Iceland who I spoke with was very proud of the fact that the country [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  uses their volcanoes in a constructive way. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=223.39999999999998s)]
*  They harness geothermal energy from them to generate electricity and heat their water [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=228.32s)]
*  and heat their homes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  And they don't need to buy oil to do those things because they're exploiting their volcanoes [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  basically. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=240.0s)]
*  But of course the trade-off there is in order to exploit them best you have to be close [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=241.04s)]
*  to them and if you're close to them eventually an eruption will threaten homes, threaten [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=244.96s)]
*  towns and cities and with risks come benefits. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L21xIU4tNM0&t=250.08s)]
