Video Description: SoftBank’s longtime strategy of dumping mountains of cash on promising young companies to create big winners failed dramatically at WeWork and is inviting scrutiny into the fund’s other investments. Here’s a look at Vision Fund’s structure, and how its fast paced investment strategy could make it risky.

# How a $100 Billion Fund Is Changing Investing  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 11, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4)
*  These days, everyone's talking about WeWork. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=0.0s)]
*  This fall, WeWork scrapped a planned IPO and ran dangerously short on cash. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  The office-based startup turned to SoftBank for a rescue deal that saw its valuation, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=8.76s)]
*  once as high as $47 billion, fall to under $8 billion. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=13.92s)]
*  Now attention has turned to the venture capital fund that helped pump up WeWork's valuation [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=18.0s)]
*  and fund its super-fast growth. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=22.64s)]
*  The Vision Fund, started in 2017 by the Japanese telecom conglomerate SoftBank, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=25.2s)]
*  has raised a lot of money to pump up high-profile startups like WeWork. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=30.16s)]
*  How much money? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=34.56s)]
*  $100 billion. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=35.56s)]
*  The Vision Fund has rewritten the rules of venture investing and driven up the valuation [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=37.36s)]
*  of tech startups. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=41.08s)]
*  But that strategy of showering money on promising young companies failed with WeWork, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  and it's starting to show cracks in other investments as well. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=46.68s)]
*  The Vision Fund is unique among venture capital funds for a few reasons. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=49.04s)]
*  Venture funds typically look for startups with strong growth potential. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=58.24s)]
*  But because these investments are high-risk, high-reward, funds tend to be conservative. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=61.24s)]
*  They raise small amounts of money and they write small checks to entrepreneurs. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=65.92s)]
*  That's not the case with the Vision Fund. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=69.6s)]
*  In 2018, all U.S. venture capital firms combined raised about $55 billion. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=71.6s)]
*  The Vision Fund's $100 billion war chest is nearly twice as large. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=77.52s)]
*  It has spent it quickly, investing about $1 billion a week in its first year. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=81.6s)]
*  Here's a breakdown of where all this money came from. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=86.0s)]
*  SoftBank chipped in $25 billion itself. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=88.8s)]
*  Another $60 billion came from the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=92.08s)]
*  The rest came from corporate partners like Apple and electronics manufacturer Foxconn. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  About $40 billion of the fund was raised in the form of a loan, with an annual interest [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=102.6s)]
*  rate of 7%. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=107.28s)]
*  Borrowing is an unusual way for a venture capital fund to raise money because they're [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=109.04s)]
*  investing in unproven companies. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=112.36s)]
*  That put pressure on the Vision Fund to start making money quickly. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=114.48s)]
*  The Vision Fund currently has investments in 88 companies, according to a spokesman. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=117.48s)]
*  WeWork is among the fund's largest. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  Many of its other investments are burning cash and haven't laid out clear paths to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=124.12s)]
*  turning a profit. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=128.24s)]
*  Three of them are ride-hailing services, which are locked in brutal price wars. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  The fund's investment strategy centers on giving startups a lot of cash to grow quickly. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=134.32s)]
*  The goal is to help a company corner its market and then go public, allowing the Vision Fund [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=138.68s)]
*  to cash out with a sizable return. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=142.44s)]
*  The fund has invested at a furious pace. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=144.44s)]
*  The $100 billion was meant to last four years, but is nearly gone after just two. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=146.72s)]
*  But it hasn't yet cashed out of most of its investments, and of the companies that have [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=151.88s)]
*  gone public, some have underperformed. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=155.68s)]
*  The Vision Fund's stake in publicly traded Uber is now worth less than what the fund [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=158.44s)]
*  paid to invest, and its profits on Slack have been declining since the messaging app [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=162.68s)]
*  company went public. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=167.56s)]
*  For the still private companies in its portfolio, the Vision Fund has at times saddled these [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=169.88s)]
*  startups with more cash than they asked for. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=173.84s)]
*  Dog-walking startup WAG was seeking $75 million in funding before the Vision Fund persuaded [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=176.72s)]
*  it to take $300 million. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  The investment was to help the startup defeat its rival, Rover. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=184.84s)]
*  But WAG's growth stalled while Rover sales continued to increase. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=188.24s)]
*  Now WAG is trying to sell itself, likely at a price below the $650 million valuation [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=192.0s)]
*  of the Vision Fund's investment. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=198.0s)]
*  In late 2018, the Vision Fund made a big bet on FAIR, a startup that leases cars to consumers [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=199.84s)]
*  as well as to ride-hale drivers. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=205.92s)]
*  But former employees said the company expanded and offered promotions that made car leases [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=208.0s)]
*  unprofitable. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=212.3s)]
*  FAIR's CEO resigned in October, after the company laid off 40% of its workforce. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=214.3s)]
*  The board temporarily installed a Vision Fund partner in his place. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=219.44s)]
*  SoftBank also installed one of its executives, Marcelo Clare, as executive chairman of WeWork [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=223.44s)]
*  after the startup's CEO, Adam Neumann, was pushed out. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=228.96s)]
*  SoftBank also sank another $6.5 billion into WeWork to stabilize the company. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=232.8s)]
*  SoftBank CEO Masayoshi San took the blame for the WeWork debacle when he announced in [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  November that the fund had an operating loss of nearly $9 billion for its most recent quarter. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=242.2s)]
*  Despite the fund's short track record, SoftBank is trying to raise a second Vision Fund. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=248.24s)]
*  The Vision Fund's arrival caused a tectonic shift in the speed and scale of startup investing, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=253.38s)]
*  but it remains to be seen whether they can consistently find winners in Silicon Valley. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX7ATRqoeA4&t=258.32s)]
