# China’s Next Economic Transformation Going Carbon Neutral by 2060  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 30, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4)
*  China has held the mantle of the world's biggest polluter for more than a decade. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=0.0s)]
*  It emits the most greenhouse gases and uses more coal than the rest of the world combined. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=5.44s)]
*  But in September, it made the biggest climate commitment ever made by any nation. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=10.8s)]
*  The carbon emissions of the carbon dioxide have reached a peak in 2030. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=15.52s)]
*  We are working hard to achieve carbon neutralization by 2060. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=22.48s)]
*  China's pledge is expected to not only improve lifestyle and air quality for urbanites tired of smog, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=29.2s)]
*  it could also boost the clean energy business and bring hundreds of millions of electric vehicles on the road. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=35.04s)]
*  After President Xi Jinping's announcement, stocks of Chinese renewable energy giants soared. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=41.04s)]
*  There are questions about whether China can really achieve its climate goal. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=47.28s)]
*  But as Beijing pushes ahead with its plan, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=51.68s)]
*  the growing green superpower could affect the US and the rest of the world. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=54.08s)]
*  China's green energy leap won't be cheap. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=61.44s)]
*  Over the next 30 years, Beijing and clean energy companies will need to spend anywhere between $5 to $20 trillion. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=64.0s)]
*  So we don't know exactly how much Beijing is going to spend, although it's already spending a lot. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=70.96s)]
*  We do know that Beijing is very good at stimulating the creation of very large industries. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=75.28s)]
*  The first step is ramping up renewable energy. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=82.16s)]
*  And that's not impossible because China already has a lot of solar parks and wind farms, more than any other country. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=84.64s)]
*  But China needs a lot more. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  90% of the country's energy has to be renewable or nuclear by 2050 to achieve net zero emissions. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  In past years, renewable capacity has boomed in large part because of subsidies. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=100.8s)]
*  And these companies haven't had to compete in the global marketplace. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  In a strategy shift, Beijing wants to roll back some of that direct support for companies. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=109.6s)]
*  You kind of slowly dial down the support and only the companies that are actually of high quality and are able to innovate will be able to survive that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=114.56s)]
*  Having renewable energy on tap provides a clean source of power for its electric vehicles. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  China already has the most in the world and wants $300 million on the road by 2050. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=132.64s)]
*  China has the resources to do these kind of top-down government pushes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  They've just mandated that a certain percentage of all government-owned fleets, like a certain amount of the buses, a certain amount of the corporate fleets or the government, have to be EVs. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=143.44s)]
*  And so that kind of creates a baseline kind of structural level demand. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=154.8s)]
*  But Beijing has also cut subsidies for people in the market to buy electric vehicles, as well as for local manufacturers. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=160.4s)]
*  As a result, companies like BYD and Bike have seen their sales slump, while Tesla has been able to speed ahead to become the market leader in China. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=167.52s)]
*  But still, Beijing is keeping foreign automakers in check by requiring them to use Chinese-made batteries. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  This kind of policy has helped China get a good grip on the supply chain for lithium-ion batteries, which accounts for more than half of global production. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=182.88s)]
*  But that advantage could slip. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=191.28s)]
*  There's a lot of lithium out there in the world. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=193.68s)]
*  If lithium prices start to go up, I think there'll be a lot of capital coming from a lot of different places to develop those deposits. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  I think it will be actually quite hard for China to kind of dominate the control of lithium. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=204.84s)]
*  Renewables can only have an impact if China moves away from coal. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=211.36s)]
*  But it won't be easy to switch off these plants. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=215.32s)]
*  There's a lot of banks that have lent to those coal plants. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=218.16s)]
*  That's potentially a financial problem. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  There's still a fair amount of people working in the coal industry. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=222.72s)]
*  So there's going to be a lot of kind of vested interests in keeping coal alive in some form or another in China. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=226.28s)]
*  Enter carbon capture technology, which would allow some coal plants to stay online. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=234.0s)]
*  The technology would remove CO2 from the atmosphere so it can be stored or repurposed. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=239.24s)]
*  Many of these techniques have been around for decades, but it's still incredibly expensive, costing about $43 to capture one ton of CO2. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=244.56s)]
*  That means for a country of 1.4 billion people, where each person emits seven tons of carbon dioxide every year, the cost would be astronomical. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=253.4s)]
*  So Beijing will have to make polluters responsible for their own carbon emissions by making them pay for it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=262.76s)]
*  You're also going to have to create an incentive to make it more expensive to produce emissions by burning coal or other forms of fossil fuels. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=268.96s)]
*  And so a real carbon trading program in China, that would be a huge incentive for coal producers to invest in carbon capture technology. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=279.24s)]
*  In October, Chinese officials announced plans to expand its emissions trading program in the next five years. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  While the current pilot schemes cover sectors like steel and cement, the nationwide one would bring in heavy emitters like the aviation industry. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=294.6s)]
*  China's 2060 goal could have ripple effects. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=304.72s)]
*  Its large scale investments could further drive down the costs of clean tech around the world. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=307.84s)]
*  The same way solar panel prices have plunged more than 80 percent, in part because of the dominance of Chinese firms. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=312.84s)]
*  But China isn't alone in thinking about this energy transition. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=319.71999999999997s)]
*  Its relatively smaller neighbors, Japan and South Korea, set a 2050 deadline for carbon neutrality. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=323.36s)]
*  And some European players are investing heavily in renewables. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=329.4s)]
*  While Trump has signaled that he sees an energy transition as a threat to the oil and gas industry, Joe Biden has proposed a two trillion dollar climate change plan. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=333.56s)]
*  These competitors and countries could also grow increasingly wary of China. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=342.8s)]
*  There will be a worry both in terms of subsidies and China producing things below cost, and then also being too dependent on China for their energy supply. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQQ8fyWJi4&t=347.76s)]
