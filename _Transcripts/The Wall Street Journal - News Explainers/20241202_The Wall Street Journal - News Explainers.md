*  Nearly 14 years after Japan's worst nuclear disaster, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=0.0s)]
*  the area around the Fukushima power plant remains a ghost town. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=5.0s)]
*  Homes and businesses are closed indefinitely, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=10.0s)]
*  and the place is littered with belongings abandoned in the evacuation. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=14.0s)]
*  The exclusion zone is the ultimate reminder of the dangers of nuclear power gone awry. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=19.0s)]
*  The meltdown at Fukushima led to the closure of all of Japan's nuclear reactors, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=26.0s)]
*  and the most complex cleanup operation in modern history that continues to this day. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=31.0s)]
*  The Fukushima plant will stay shut forever, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=37.0s)]
*  but power companies are clamoring to restart dormant reactors across Japan [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=40.0s)]
*  as the AI revolution sends demand for energy soaring. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=45.0s)]
*  Here's how Japan is grappling with atomic energy's dramatic comeback [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=49.0s)]
*  in the shadow of disaster. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=53.0s)]
*  We traveled into the Fukushima exclusion zone with TEPCO, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=57.0s)]
*  the company that manages the plant. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=61.0s)]
*  As we drive closer to the site, the radiation counter on the bus ticks steadily higher. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=63.0s)]
*  Large areas around the plant remain frozen in time, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=69.0s)]
*  a testament to the consequences of nuclear energy's destructive power. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=73.0s)]
*  The 2011 earthquake and resulting tsunami knocked out the plant's cooling system, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=83.0s)]
*  causing three reactors to melt down. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=89.0s)]
*  TEPCO has been cleaning up ever since, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=92.0s)]
*  but stubbornly high levels of radiation make that a complex and expensive operation. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=95.0s)]
*  Opponents of nuclear power see the Fukushima meltdown as the inevitable result [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=101.0s)]
*  of relying on a dangerous energy source. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=106.0s)]
*  The concentration of radiation is highest at the damaged reactors, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=109.0s)]
*  and we were only allowed to stay in the nearest zone for 15 minutes to limit our exposure. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=113.0s)]
*  Japan is in one of the most seismically active regions in the world, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=119.0s)]
*  so TEPCO has had to build a number of fail-safes around the site [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=124.0s)]
*  in case another disaster strikes. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=129.0s)]
*  This wall next to me here is 16 meters high. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=132.0s)]
*  That's just a little bit taller than the tsunami that hit in March 2011, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=136.0s)]
*  so the plant should be protected against further tsunamis [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=142.0s)]
*  as decades of decommissioning work continue. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=146.0s)]
*  Japan has already spent more than $80 billion on making the site safe and paying compensation, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=150.0s)]
*  and that cost is still rising. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=156.0s)]
*  In the midst of the massive cleanup, TEPCO and other companies [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=159.0s)]
*  are fighting to restart reactors across Japan. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=163.0s)]
*  Owners of nuclear plants hope that they can sign lucrative contracts with tech companies. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=167.0s)]
*  AI pioneers in need of enormous amounts of energy to keep data centers running [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=172.0s)]
*  are betting billions of dollars on the nuclear power plant. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=177.0s)]
*  The company is also working on a new technology that will be able to do that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=181.0s)]
*  The companies that are working to keep data centers running [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=186.0s)]
*  are betting billions of dollars on nuclear power. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=189.0s)]
*  After well-publicized accidents sparked a shift away from nuclear energy, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=192.0s)]
*  there is now a global race to secure access to atomic power. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=197.0s)]
*  Microsoft recently struck a deal to restart Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=201.0s)]
*  the site of America's worst nuclear accident. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=206.0s)]
*  The idea of data centers is now supercharging the debate over restarting reactors. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=210.0s)]
*  Before Fukushima led to a nationwide shutdown, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=216.0s)]
*  Japan's 54 nuclear reactors provided nearly one-third of the country's energy supply. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=219.0s)]
*  Only 13 reactors are back online under tight restrictions. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=226.0s)]
*  The offline reactors that are operable have a total capacity of about 24 gigawatts. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=231.0s)]
*  That's enough to power hundreds of data centers. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=236.0s)]
*  Japan's idle sites include the world's largest nuclear plant, known as KKNPP. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=239.0s)]
*  The seven reactors here can generate 8.2 gigawatts of atomic power. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=246.0s)]
*  That's double the capacity of the biggest plant in the U.S. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=251.0s)]
*  On one of his last trips as ambassador to Japan, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=255.0s)]
*  Rahm Emanuel visited the site to lobby the country to switch the reactors back on. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=259.0s)]
*  These data centers that are going to be huge and only exponentially growing, and we can see it, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=264.0s)]
*  you can't get into a situation either you're powering the data center or you're powering your phone. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=270.0s)]
*  And if we don't have a reliable power, we're going to get to that place. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=275.0s)]
*  Calls for restarting the reactors may be getting louder, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=281.0s)]
*  but many in the country remain scarred by the events of 2011. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=284.0s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=294.0s)]
*  We don't know if we have the confidence. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=296.0s)]
*  That's the scariest thing. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=300.0s)]
*  There are many stories about the local people who came to the site for the sake of their faith. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=302.0s)]
*  But after that, many people's lives are at risk. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=308.0s)]
*  I think the public has every right to ask questions, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=312.0s)]
*  but at a certain point you get to that choice, you know, that you've got to make a decision. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=315.0s)]
*  I think nuclear power is an important answer to the future. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=321.0s)]
*  Japan is at a crossroads. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=329.0s)]
*  Its vast nuclear plants stand ready to fuel a new era that's set to be defined by A.I.'s insatiable thirst for power. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=331.0s)]
*  But Fukushima's shadow hangs heavy over the country. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=340.0s)]
*  Radiation levels in the evacuation zone are falling, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=345.0s)]
*  but entire towns may remain hollowed out for years to come. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=348.0s)]
*  While many are turning to the potential of nuclear energy, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=353.0s)]
*  Japan serves as a reminder of the perils when things go wrong. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb9jB7FAPYo&t=356.0s)]
