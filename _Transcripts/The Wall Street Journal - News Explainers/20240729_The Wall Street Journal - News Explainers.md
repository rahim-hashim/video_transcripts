# Former Israeli Undercover Agent Breaks Down Tactics Used in Palestine  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k)
*  It was a daring mission to save hostages trapped in a war zone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=0.0s)]
*  The daylight raid that rescued four Israelis held captive by Hamas and Gaza [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=4.0s)]
*  opened a window to a world of espionage. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=9.0s)]
*  The rescue, which left at least a hundred dead, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=13.0s)]
*  is just one among a string of undercover operations captured on video. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=16.0s)]
*  The journal sat down with Shia Pallad, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=23.0s)]
*  one of the first female undercover officers to work with Hamas, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=25.0s)]
*  a specialist unit within the Israeli border police. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=29.0s)]
*  Our job as undercover fighters is to always come up with new tactical methods [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=32.0s)]
*  to fight in and to blend in the fields. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=40.0s)]
*  We asked her to explain the tactics and skills required to work deep undercover. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=43.0s)]
*  COVID operations have been a pillar of Israel's national security since its founding. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=49.0s)]
*  Israel is always very vulnerable for threats around us, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=54.0s)]
*  so we need to be very alert all the time. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=58.0s)]
*  Units like Pallad's have infiltrated Palestinian militant strongholds for decades, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=61.0s)]
*  but extended their work during the second inter-fada. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=66.0s)]
*  The undercover unit of the border police was established, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=69.0s)]
*  and the significance was the ability to move in the field [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=72.0s)]
*  and getting to those terrorists before they're blowing their shells up [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=78.0s)]
*  or going to stab Israeli civilians. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=83.0s)]
*  Israel's undercover teams are sometimes referred to as Mr. Varim, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=88.0s)]
*  meaning those who are proficient in Arab culture. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=92.0s)]
*  Their missions range from rescuing hostages to killing or capturing high-value targets [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=96.0s)]
*  in Palestinian territories. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=101.0s)]
*  It requires a very specific skill set. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=103.0s)]
*  Undercover fighters are, first of all, fighters. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=106.0s)]
*  We need to really blend in like a set of a movie and be very quiet [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=109.0s)]
*  and be very chill in order to get to our targets [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=115.0s)]
*  and then drop off our costumes and become soldiers and fighters. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=119.0s)]
*  Israel has declined to discuss the use of civilian vehicles [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=124.0s)]
*  during the hostage rescue operation in June. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=127.0s)]
*  However, eyewitnesses said this commercial truck transported Israeli special forces [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=130.0s)]
*  near the Nusrat refugee camp on the day of the mission. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=135.0s)]
*  The vehicles are a part of the cover story. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=139.0s)]
*  In the field, we can always do it on foot, and a vehicle is really like a costume. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=142.0s)]
*  It's not enough to find the right vehicle. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=147.0s)]
*  You need to disguise it so it will work out in this specific territory. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=150.0s)]
*  Video released by Israeli police shows commandos wearing battle fatigues [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=160.0s)]
*  when they enter the apartment to reach the hostages. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=165.0s)]
*  But Pallad believes the work of the advanced undercover teams led to this moment. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=168.0s)]
*  After the word act on the radio, the undercover team was already exposed [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=173.0s)]
*  and the uniformed team went into action. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=178.0s)]
*  The uniformed unit took control over the operation [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=181.0s)]
*  and went inside the house to save the hostages. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=185.0s)]
*  A battle arose in the middle of the night. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=192.0s)]
*  A battle erupted in the streets when an outbreak of gunfire alerted Hamas to the operation. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=196.0s)]
*  The Israeli Air Force struck a planned list of targets in Nusrat [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=204.0s)]
*  to lay cover for the hostage rescue teams. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=208.0s)]
*  Palestinian health authorities said 274 Gazans were killed and nearly 700 injured. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=211.0s)]
*  The Israeli military said about 100 Gazans were killed or wounded, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=217.0s)]
*  including militants and civilians caught in the crossfire. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=221.0s)]
*  When we go in the field, the only thing that we know for sure [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=224.0s)]
*  is that everything around us can happen. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=228.0s)]
*  Nothing is in my control. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=231.0s)]
*  And I need to learn how to think and work inside of uncertainty, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=234.0s)]
*  really big uncertainty. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=239.0s)]
*  This isn't the first time undercover teams have been involved in high-stakes missions. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=244.0s)]
*  Four months earlier, security footage captured this dramatic raid inside a West Bank hospital. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=248.0s)]
*  You can see the undercover team inside the hospital already [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=253.0s)]
*  after they got the World Act and pulled out their guns. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=258.0s)]
*  The armed Israeli agents, disguised as Palestinian medics, patients and civilians, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=264.0s)]
*  can be seen rushing through the hospital's corridors. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=269.0s)]
*  This is unusual because usually we don't really go in buildings unless we have to. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=273.0s)]
*  Part of the costume is actually the accessories, the wheelchair and a lot of other accessories, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=279.0s)]
*  maybe to conceal part of the gear, to help them go in without anybody seeing something suspicious. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=285.0s)]
*  Three Palestinian militants were killed in this operation, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=293.0s)]
*  which drew criticism of Israel for operating within a hospital. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=297.0s)]
*  Israel said the militants had been hiding in the hospital [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=300.0s)]
*  and using it as a base for planning terrorist activities and carrying out attacks. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=303.0s)]
*  Other instances where undercover agents have posed as Palestinians include protests. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=309.0s)]
*  Everything in a demonstration happens in a split second. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=315.0s)]
*  So when everybody is focused on throwing stones, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=319.0s)]
*  it may become more violent during the demonstrations. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=323.0s)]
*  They really lose focus on what's happening around them. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=327.0s)]
*  And then when the undercover fighters act and it happens in seconds, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=330.0s)]
*  the element of surprise is very critical. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=335.0s)]
*  In this footage, protesters can be seen focusing on stone throwing, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=338.0s)]
*  while behind them a team of Israeli undercover operatives, seen here, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=342.0s)]
*  are about to move in on their targets. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=346.0s)]
*  They're exposed, they catch him and it's over. It's over in seconds. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=351.0s)]
*  Undercover missions rely on weeks of intelligence gathering [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=357.0s)]
*  by a network of Palestinian informants and undercover Israeli agents. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=360.0s)]
*  They can also require thousands of soldiers on standby. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=364.0s)]
*  The risks inside a big operation like we saw with the hostage is from the minutes you get in the field. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=368.0s)]
*  Your life is in danger. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=377.0s)]
*  We saw that one of the commanders of the rescue team was killed. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=379.0s)]
*  That can happen when you work in a very crowded territory. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=383.0s)]
*  Israel said 116 hostages remained in Gaza following the Nusrat operation. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=388.0s)]
*  But the successful rescue of four hostages from deep within Gaza [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=394.0s)]
*  is reflective of the experience Israel's military has developed [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=398.0s)]
*  over decades running undercover teams. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=402.0s)]
*  In order to execute an operation like that, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=404.0s)]
*  you have to come up with information and tactic methods from all kinds [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=407.0s)]
*  because it's a very complicated thing to do in a very complicated time. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=413.0s)]
*  It's not a usual undercover classic work, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=418.0s)]
*  and to see that kind of cooperation was really, for me, the brilliant thing in this operation. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=422.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qVL73Ro9k&t=437.0s)]
