# Kamala Harris A Stronger Candidate Against Trump?  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM)
*  With President Biden expected to drop out of the 2024 election, some are rallying behind [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=0.0s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  No one knows better how to prosecute the case against Donald Trump than Kamala Harris. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=8.68s)]
*  She tried, remember, in 2020 in the Democratic primary. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  And we'll see if she's able to come out strong and then maintain that success this time around. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  It does put us in a position to have a significantly more competitive election had Joe Biden stayed [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=21.16s)]
*  in the race. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=25.8s)]
*  Here's how Harris could stack up in a race against former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=26.8s)]
*  Donald Trump simply does not have the character to be president of the United States. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=31.8s)]
*  Experts say Harris could have a tough campaign trail ahead, but she does have some key advantages. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=38.44s)]
*  How do you win the presidency if you don't win the majority of white voters? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=44.08s)]
*  You have to check off all of the other boxes. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=47.84s)]
*  One advantage Harris has is her potential to win over more women, people of color, and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  young voters. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  We're going to be able to effectively make the case about women's health care, their [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  right in terms of choosing how they want to live their lives. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=60.04s)]
*  This is a fight for freedom, the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=63.76s)]
*  her own body. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=71.28s)]
*  A Wall Street Journal poll in April found that abortion was the most powerful issue [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=72.96s)]
*  by far, driving suburban women in swing states. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=77.12s)]
*  Over half of the women in the poll said Trump's policies on abortion were too restrictive. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=80.64s)]
*  Some Democrats and political experts also expect Harris to invoke more excitement from [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  black voters. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=90.44000000000001s)]
*  A critical advantage at a time when support from that group was slipping for Biden. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=91.44000000000001s)]
*  As an African-American woman, she's going to have a unique opportunity in terms of how [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=98.44000000000001s)]
*  she communicates and has a conversation with voters in Detroit, Michigan, Philadelphia, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=102.44000000000001s)]
*  Pennsylvania. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  These urban centers are really where we're going to need historic turnout to consolidate [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=109.08000000000001s)]
*  Harris could stand to gain younger voters who had lost confidence in Biden's ability [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=114.55999999999999s)]
*  to beat Trump. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=121.64s)]
*  Kamala Harris gets to be the knight in shining armor here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=122.64s)]
*  She gets to ride in on the horse and be the candidate that is not Joe Biden, that can [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=125.64s)]
*  carry the policies and ideas of Joe Biden without some of the concerns that led to Joe [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=129.84s)]
*  Biden's decision to remove himself. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  A July poll by Emerson College conducted before the assassination attempt on Trump found that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=136.84s)]
*  people between the ages of 18 and 29 were the least motivated to vote. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=142.04s)]
*  Biden was still leading the Democratic ticket at the time of the poll. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=147.16s)]
*  It's the younger Democrats, which is, in my opinion, the base of the party. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  And it's more than just voting. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=154.72s)]
*  It's about canvassing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=156.12s)]
*  It's about phone calling. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=157.12s)]
*  It's about get out the vote efforts. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=158.12s)]
*  All of this is part of the campaign that I think was lacking with Biden. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  And that's why we have Harris to see if we can capture that energy that has been missing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=166.56s)]
*  Harris actually channels a lot of the candidate characteristics and features of Obama that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=173.04s)]
*  generated this excitement in 2008. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  He was awesome. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  He was brilliant. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  Just what I was looking for. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  This is a young candidate of color that is going to sell us on a vision of America that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=185.7s)]
*  is multicultural, that is more unified, that is moving into a new future. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=190.44s)]
*  At 59 years old, Harris is significantly younger than Biden, who's 81. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=195.72s)]
*  We get to go coast to coast without worrying about her energy level in terms of hitting [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=200.48s)]
*  critical media markets. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=205.08s)]
*  Some political experts say Harris's background as a prosecutor helped her come off as a strong [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=207.32s)]
*  debater in her 2020 presidential campaign. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=212.2s)]
*  There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=215.4s)]
*  her public schools. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=220.48s)]
*  And she was bussed to school every day. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=222.16s)]
*  And that little girl was me. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=225.4s)]
*  This becomes a moment where Harris looks extremely strong. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=227.16s)]
*  Suddenly she goes from polling in the single digits to close to 20 percent. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=229.96s)]
*  And after her vice presidential debate with Mike Pence, polls showed that more voters [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=233.84s)]
*  thought she won. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=238.4s)]
*  Susan, this is important. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=240.04s)]
*  And I want to add that if Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=242.04s)]
*  Experts say that in a race against Trump, she needs to replicate that debate's success. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=246.28s)]
*  You also have to be very careful because we've never seen someone survive an assassination [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=251.12s)]
*  and then step onto the debate stage, talk about this openly as a signal of love of country. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=256.88s)]
*  How will Kamala Harris handle the events that have catapulted Trump's popularity and favorability [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=262.64s)]
*  amongst his base? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=268.4s)]
*  Recent polls like this one by Emerson College show Harris significantly trails Trump. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=270.52s)]
*  What we've seen over the last year when Biden was on the ticket is Trump had a ceiling of [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=275.6s)]
*  about 46 percent. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=279.8s)]
*  Never does he really go above that number, not before the conviction, after the conviction, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=281.52s)]
*  post-debate. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=286.0s)]
*  Biden was losing ground or gaining ground, but not being able to get over 45 percent. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=287.0s)]
*  Can a Harris candidacy get over 45, 48 percent? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=292.6s)]
*  What she really needs to do is get closer to 50 percent and that could give the Democrats [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=296.36s)]
*  the edge. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=300.2s)]
*  But polls only capture voters' feelings at a specific moment in time. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=301.2s)]
*  And these results came in before the assassination attempt on Trump and before Biden dropped [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=305.28s)]
*  out of the race. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=310.8s)]
*  When we're looking at these polls prior to the announcement, these are hypothetical candidates [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=312.28s)]
*  and we ask voters who really haven't taken much time to think about these individuals. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=317.44s)]
*  So they give you a knee-jerk reaction generally based on name recognition. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  With Harris, you see lower numbers in some of these demographics, but over the course [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  of a few weeks, I expect to see them bounce back in her favor. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=331.2s)]
*  But in a toe-to-toe race against Trump, experts say Harris would need to prove that she's [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=335.96s)]
*  a strong leader, something 44 percent of voters said they were looking for in a candidate, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=340.56s)]
*  according to a poll by Monmouth University. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=345.88s)]
*  Donald Trump, this is a person that is not shy on confidence. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  Nobody knows the system better than me. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=352.24s)]
*  With people who are already sort of ideologically aligned and therefore also see Trump as an [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=354.92s)]
*  effective leader, he's in a prime position to demonstrate this idea of, I am the leader [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=359.96s)]
*  of the free world. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=366.52s)]
*  With Kamala Harris, what will be her I am the leader of the free world moment? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=367.96s)]
*  The biggest concern for Harris will be immigration. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=372.35999999999996s)]
*  My trip to Guatemala and Mexico was about addressing the root causes. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=375.68s)]
*  She's going to have to defend those policies. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=380.96s)]
*  Kamala had one job, one job, and that was to fix the border. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=383.08s)]
*  Now imagine her in charge of the entire country. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=391.15999999999997s)]
*  But at the end of the day, some experts say this is a race based on personalities, not [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=395.04s)]
*  policies. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=399.92s)]
*  And Harris replacing Biden would force the Trump campaign to change its offensive strategy. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=401.08000000000004s)]
*  Trump has spent so much time the last three and a half years on Biden. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=406.36s)]
*  Could you imagine if Biden was up here and the teleprompters didn't work? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=411.08000000000004s)]
*  And we'll see how he's able to make his case against Harris. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=415.52000000000004s)]
*  They can't decide which of their candidates is more unfit to be president, sleepy crooked [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=420.88s)]
*  Joe Biden or laughing Kamala. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=428.64s)]
*  Harris entering the race now would be the latest a candidate has joined a presidential [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  election since 1968. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=436.04s)]
*  Biden had been the presumptive nominee since March. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=438.48s)]
*  This creates questions around how well organized the Democratic Party may be. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=441.6s)]
*  It's a very short onboarding process. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=446.48s)]
*  Joe Biden, Donald Trump, they've been around. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=448.8s)]
*  While Vice President Harris has had an extensive career, it's certainly not nearly as long [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=451.44000000000005s)]
*  as these other two candidates. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=456.88000000000005s)]
*  But a big question remains. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=458.24s)]
*  Who would Harris pick to be her vice president? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=460.44000000000005s)]
*  It's going to be very important both regionally and demographically because she needs to sure [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  up some of her base. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=467.6s)]
*  That decision might be the key to what experts say is Harris's best path forward. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  The Obama coalition that we saw in 2008. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=474.48s)]
*  Can you bring that group back together? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=477.52000000000004s)]
*  That's a coalition of robust historical turnout, African Americans dominating amongst Latinos [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=480.12s)]
*  and really holding your own amongst white voters and rural voters. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=485.56s)]
*  So that way there's no more bleed to the Republican Party. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=488.92s)]
*  What the Democrats really liked was President Obama in his ability to articulate ideas and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvhkLHnOAM&t=491.88s)]
