# Why Tesla Competitor Nikola Saw Its Stock Fizzle Out  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 15, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0)
*  This is the Nikola 1, a semi-truck designed to run on electricity and hydrogen, not diesel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=0.0s)]
*  It was unveiled to the world in December 2016, and at the time, investors seemed confident [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=6.68s)]
*  that it was a first step towards a hydrogen-fuel-powered future. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=12.44s)]
*  It's my pleasure to introduce the Nikola 1 to the world. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=15.76s)]
*  After going public in June, Nikola's market cap briefly surpassed Ford, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=24.52s)]
*  fueled by big promises made by founder Trevor Milton and a frenzy of investor excitement [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=28.48s)]
*  in the electric vehicle industry. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=33.2s)]
*  But more recently, the EV startup has been mired in controversy. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=35.28s)]
*  Nikola shares are tumbling after a short seller called the company, quote, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=39.52s)]
*  an intricate fraud built on dozens of lies. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=42.88s)]
*  Just months after the company's shares hit all-time highs, its stock has lost almost [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=46.8s)]
*  80% of its value. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  This is the cautionary story of Nikola, the Wall Street darling that now faces federal [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=53.74s)]
*  investigations and an uncertain future. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=58.08s)]
*  We have essentially doubled the freight efficiency of our freight, and the first people in the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  world to ever do that on a diesel in the last long time. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=65.36s)]
*  In December 2016, when Nikola unveiled the prototype, founder Trevor Milton claimed the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=69.64s)]
*  truck was fully functioning and that it had generated $2.3 billion in pre-sales in its [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=74.68s)]
*  first month. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=79.96s)]
*  Investment from the auto industry began to flow in. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=81.48s)]
*  Investors are interested in electric cars because it's the future of the industry. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=84.26s)]
*  Global warming, emissions targets and government regulation are all kind of pushing in that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=88.34s)]
*  direction. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=94.18s)]
*  Over the following year, Nikola quietly gained attention as Trevor Milton spoke at events [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=95.18s)]
*  and sold his vision to investors around the world. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=100.18s)]
*  Here he is in Oslo, Norway. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=103.1s)]
*  I know right now I can provide Europe and Norway a truck that is 30% less than a diesel [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=104.78s)]
*  and is 100% zero emission. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=111.02s)]
*  The company's CEO not only promised a zero emission hydrogen and electric truck, but [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=113.02s)]
*  the fuel and cross-country infrastructure of power stations to support it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=117.66s)]
*  Three months later, the company released a video of its semi-truck. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=122.25999999999999s)]
*  It represented it as in motion, leaving the viewer to interpret it as propelling itself. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=126.14s)]
*  And just a few days later, Nikola announced plans for a 1 million square foot Arizona [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=131.98s)]
*  manufacturing facility that would provide 2,000 jobs. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=136.54s)]
*  So today, I am proud to announce that Nikola Motor Company is coming to Arizona. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=140.1s)]
*  Fast forward to April 2019. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=148.45999999999998s)]
*  Nikola had another big announcement. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=150.98s)]
*  Introducing the most advanced semi-truck the world has ever seen. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=152.98s)]
*  The first hydrogen production class 8 truck that can beat a diesel in every category. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=157.74s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, the Nikola 2. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=164.57999999999998s)]
*  So the company revealed the Nikola 2. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=168.9s)]
*  They had not yet finished or sold any of the Nikola 1s. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=170.62s)]
*  The company says that it was a successful proof of concept, but they never appeared [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=174.3s)]
*  to have finished or built or sold any of them. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=178.94s)]
*  Nikola was really selling investors on an idea and a vision of the future. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=181.82s)]
*  A zero emission, you know, transportation heavy world that they not only made trucks [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=186.34s)]
*  for but made and sold fuel for. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=192.22s)]
*  And Nikola seemed committed to that vision. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=195.42000000000002s)]
*  In November, the company completed what it claimed was the first ever zero emission beer [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=197.9s)]
*  delivery in partnership with Anheuser-Busch, which had previously put in an order for 800 [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=202.66s)]
*  hydrogen electric semi-trucks. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=208.06s)]
*  And after the demonstration, public enthusiasm for the company continued to grow. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=210.34s)]
*  When Nikola went public on June 4th, 2020, it shot out of the door. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=214.74s)]
*  Just days later, Milton tweeted that orders would soon open for the all electric Badger [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  pickup truck. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=223.46s)]
*  The next day, the company's stock doubled. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=224.66s)]
*  The owners of electric truck maker Nikola are rallying. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=227.5s)]
*  A day later, Nikola's market value briefly surpassed Ford and the successes didn't stop. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=231.9s)]
*  Two months later, Nikola released an earnings report that it had lost $86 million in a quarter. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=238.18s)]
*  But the EV startup quickly bagged another order, this time for 2,500 trucks from Garbage [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=244.06s)]
*  Giant Republic Services. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=248.9s)]
*  Still, investor enthusiasm continued to grow. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=250.9s)]
*  On January 8th, Nikola announced a major new partnership with auto heavyweight General [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=253.9s)]
*  Motors. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=258.22s)]
*  Nikola Badger will be engineered and manufactured by GM, GM getting an 11 percent ownership [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=259.22s)]
*  stake in Nikola. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=264.9s)]
*  Trevor Milton was really kind of a consummate showman. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=266.54s)]
*  He held these big events where he had these big reveals of trucks that may or may not [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=270.9s)]
*  have really functioned. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=275.54s)]
*  He was capable of getting other companies to invest in his vision and lend their credibility [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=277.98s)]
*  to Nikola. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=284.46000000000004s)]
*  Sit back and watch what happens over the next five years. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=285.46000000000004s)]
*  You're going to see Nikola become one of the most valuable brands in the world. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=288.38s)]
*  Just four years after unveiling its first truck prototype, Nikola was worth billions [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=291.1s)]
*  of dollars and yet it still hadn't sold a single product. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=294.94s)]
*  And as the world watched over the following weeks, its story began to unravel. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=298.22s)]
*  On September 10th, short seller Hindenburg Research released a report that sent Nikola's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=303.36s)]
*  stock plummeting. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=307.88s)]
*  They say the company has made false statements. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=308.88s)]
*  It has rigged its truck reveals and it's had misleading demonstrations. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=311.92s)]
*  One of the accusations was about that third party video on Nikola's YouTube channel [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=316.24s)]
*  of the Nikola One prototype in motion. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=320.32s)]
*  The short seller alleged that to shoot this video Nikola had simply pulled the truck up [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=322.64s)]
*  a somewhat of a small hill and let it roll down. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=327.6s)]
*  Nikola responded as a company saying that, you know, they never represented the truck [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=331.2s)]
*  as driving under its own power. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=334.92s)]
*  But I think a lot of commenters and observers felt that it was kind of tacit admission that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=336.96s)]
*  the short seller had kind of been right. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=345.44s)]
*  I think there's definitely the threat of class action lawsuits and some law firms are [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=347.76s)]
*  recruiting plaintiffs. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  Federal prosecutors are looking for answers as well. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=353.12s)]
*  On September 15th, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Department of Justice and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  the SEC were investigating claims that Nikola had misled investors. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=360.32s)]
*  Many of these claims focused on Trevor Milton, Nikola's frontman. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=365.2s)]
*  And just a week later, the founder and executive chairman resigned from the company's board. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=369.64s)]
*  Following the news, shares of the EV startup plunged even further. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=374.67999999999995s)]
*  Just days later, reports surfaced that Nikola's talks with partners to build hydrogen stations [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=378.91999999999996s)]
*  had stalled. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=383.79999999999995s)]
*  In the few weeks after the report came out on September 10th, Nikola lost about 45% of [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  its market cap. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=390.52000000000004s)]
*  The partnership that it had announced on September 8th with General Motors was supposed to close [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=392.56s)]
*  at the end of September and has not yet closed. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=399.16s)]
*  It's started to affect Nikola's ability to attract and retain partners. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  But at this key moment, Nikola doubled down. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=406.8s)]
*  The company reiterated its business plan and some milestones that it expects to hit over [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  the next few years and really kind of reasserted that it's focused right now on execution [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  of its business plan in a post Trevor Milton era. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=422.08s)]
*  Following this news, the truckmaker's stock price began to slightly recover and its new [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=425.8s)]
*  leadership seemed confident. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=430.32s)]
*  The company's been public for what, four months. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=432.48s)]
*  So we're comfortable with the diligence we did. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=436.44s)]
*  A lot of analysts have actually reiterated that they do believe in Nikola and that they [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=440.68s)]
*  ultimately see that moving on from Trevor Milton as a good thing for the company in [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  the long run. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=452.2s)]
*  But a lot of those analysts do have written about, you know, Nikola's kind of need to [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  reestablish credibility. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=456.91999999999996s)]
*  Even though customers have yet to flock to electric vehicles, big auto companies and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  investors are betting they will soon, fueling an interest in showy startups like Nikola. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=463.15999999999997s)]
*  The fact that the markets can both be so quickly taken with a company like Nikola and then [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=468.36s)]
*  quickly kind of disenchanted with that company in a matter of months is kind of a cautionary [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=474.52000000000004s)]
*  tale of some of the enthusiasm around electric vehicle startups and kind of betting it all [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=481.04s)]
*  on the future. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=487.36s)]
*  With new leadership, certain major partnerships still in talks and multiple federal investigations [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=488.84000000000003s)]
*  underway, Nikola's future remains in the balance. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-K8llODQ0&t=493.72s)]
