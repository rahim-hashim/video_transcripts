# Why Wall Street Is Placing A Big Bet On Meatless Meat  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 13, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo)
*  For years, the meat industry has been offering beef eaters three basic options. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=0.0s)]
*  Well done, medium, or rare. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=6.44s)]
*  But that's changing. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=9.8s)]
*  Beyond meat, Impossible Foods and some traditional food makers are now targeting this market [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=11.36s)]
*  with a fourth option, meatless. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=16.06s)]
*  This new generation of fake meat comes from plant-based proteins, but they're made to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=19.32s)]
*  mimic the real thing, and investors see so much promise in these new products that they're [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=23.84s)]
*  hoovering up the stocks. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=28.56s)]
*  Beyond meat's shares have skyrocketed more than 500% since the company's IPO in May. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=37.0s)]
*  500%. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=38.56s)]
*  This puts the company's current value at about $10 billion. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=40.18s)]
*  That's more than 100 times their sales in 2018. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=44.44s)]
*  And Impossible Foods, another big player in the meatless alternatives industry, recently [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=47.94s)]
*  raised another $300 million in funding. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  These companies and others are betting that people might actually change the way they [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=57.04s)]
*  look at meat. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=60.72s)]
*  But are they right? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=61.72s)]
*  One thing that's clear? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=68.24s)]
*  The market for meatless alternatives is growing. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=69.52s)]
*  U.S. retail sales of plant-based foods, from imitation burgers to soy milk, climbed to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=72.28s)]
*  $4.5 billion in one year, rising about 11% and outpacing general retail food sales by [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=77.68s)]
*  more than five times. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=84.24s)]
*  And sales of meat alternatives topped $800 million. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=86.56s)]
*  These sales now make up about 2% of all packaged meat sales. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=90.64s)]
*  Some investors expect the purchase price of these foods to increase as the industry takes [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=94.44s)]
*  off, driving up sales even higher. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=98.72s)]
*  So in a world where fake meat has been around for decades, why are customers flocking to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=102.38s)]
*  these new products? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=106.76s)]
*  Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are marketing their products differently from traditional [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=108.56s)]
*  meatless alternatives like Garden Burger. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=112.68s)]
*  They're aiming to feed meat eaters, as well as vegans and vegetarians, since the latter [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=115.6s)]
*  group makes up less than 5% of the U.S. population. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=119.88s)]
*  In the U.S. today, there are many people who will never give up meat entirely, but who [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=123.6s)]
*  still want to eat less of it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=127.52s)]
*  For people over 40, experts say health is the biggest reason why consumers want to add [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=129.72s)]
*  meatless alternatives to their diet. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=134.48s)]
*  But for millennials who are driving the trend, the environment is the biggest reason. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  People say that farming vegetables releases less greenhouse gases than livestock production, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=141.44s)]
*  and that eating less meat helps stave off rising global temperatures. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=146.22s)]
*  Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are aiming to serve this market, giving investors the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  prospect of long-term growth to get excited about. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=154.1s)]
*  In an effort to appeal to meat eaters, companies are trying to mimic the look and taste of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=157.56s)]
*  ground beef. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=161.88s)]
*  Beyond Meat, for example, extracts proteins from yellow peas and combines them with starches, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=163.48s)]
*  oils and juices to produce patties that convincingly sizzle. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=168.68s)]
*  Though several companies have designed products with the goal of imitating real meat, Beyond [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=172.88s)]
*  Meat has taken the early lead. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=178.36s)]
*  The initial success of Beyond Meat has attracted big deals with major brands, making the product [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=180.84s)]
*  even more enticing to investors. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=185.86s)]
*  Dunkin' and the Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons recently added breakfast sandwiches [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=188.52s)]
*  made with Beyond Meat's imitation sausage. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=193.32s)]
*  Dunkin' is serving the product at some of its New York City locations, and Tim Hortons [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=196.44s)]
*  is selling their sausage patty at about 4,000 Canadian locations. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=200.4s)]
*  And since 2017, Beyond Meat has struck deals to supply burger patties to chains including [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=204.82s)]
*  TGI Fridays, Del Taco restaurants, and Carl's Jr. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  Other companies have been slower to attract big deals, and when they do, they haven't [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=214.12s)]
*  always been able to follow through. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  Many experts thought that Impossible Foods had the better product and message in the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=220.38s)]
*  earlier stages. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=224.0s)]
*  But production issues hurt them. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=225.72s)]
*  The company had to apologize to restaurants like Burger King and White Castle after experiencing [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=227.94s)]
*  supply shortages. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=232.66s)]
*  While Beyond Meat also had shortage issues in 2017 and 2018, since then they've had [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=234.6s)]
*  a clean track record. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=239.9s)]
*  In June, the company's CEO said on an earnings call that they were confident they had the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=242.1s)]
*  manufacturing lined up to meet demand. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=246.44s)]
*  With all of Beyond Meat's early success, traditional food companies have been lining [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=249.66s)]
*  up to develop similar products. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=253.72s)]
*  Companies best prepared to get in on the market include Tyson Foods, Kanagra Brands, Unilever, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=256.24s)]
*  and Nestle, according to an investor group. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=261.64s)]
*  But many investors don't see these companies posing a major threat to Beyond Meat. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=264.47999999999996s)]
*  At least for now. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=268.88s)]
*  That's because Beyond Meat is one of the few companies in the stock market that's [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=269.88s)]
*  purely focused on meat alternatives. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=273.64s)]
*  Companies with many products face more diverse challenges. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  For example, if there was a widespread E. coli contamination among U.S. cattle, Tyson's [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=279.88s)]
*  stock could go down, regardless of how much imitation meat they sell. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=285.08s)]
*  Beyond Meat could be at the cutting edge of an entirely new industry. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  There could be a whole new food category that's being built out. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=294.64s)]
*  There aren't many times you can say this. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=297.56s)]
*  It's something new and tangible. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=299.84s)]
*  In spite of this, betting big on Beyond Meat in its early stages is still risky. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=303.28s)]
*  That's because the company could wind up facing internal issues. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=308.24s)]
*  For example, other hot startups like Tesla saw their stock prices increase quickly before [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=311.92s)]
*  taking a tumble. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=317.32s)]
*  For now, it's still too early to tell if the meat alternatives industry will take off [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  the way that investors expect it to. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=323.56s)]
*  But we'll be watching. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLWAPwi6Mo&t=326.12s)]
