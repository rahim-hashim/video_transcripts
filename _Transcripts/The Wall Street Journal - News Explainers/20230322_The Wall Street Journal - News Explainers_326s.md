# Trump-Stormy Daniels Investigation: The Path to Indictment | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs)
*  Donald Trump's alleged role in paying hush money to a porn star could soon lead to criminal charges against the former president, a first in U.S. history. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=0.0s)]
*  Exclusive articles the Wall Street Journal published in 2018 triggered this investigation into Trump. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=8.94s)]
*  And reporter Joe Palazzolo is still digging. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=14.48s)]
*  I did not expect five years later to be still talking about this case at all. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=17.1s)]
*  As a grand jury is concluding its investigation, let's look at the reporting that led to this pivotal moment. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=21.72s)]
*  And what could come next? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Let's start in 2016, days before Trump's election victory. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=30.8s)]
*  USA! USA! [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=34.76s)]
*  And years before porn star Stormy Daniels would tell her side in primetime. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=37.04s)]
*  And you had sex with him? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=41.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=42.64s)]
*  You were 27, he was 60. Were you physically attracted to him? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=48.16s)]
*  Not at all? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  No. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  During the 2016 campaign, Daniels and her manager were shopping her story of an alleged affair with Trump from a decade earlier. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  She'd been on successful celebrity magazines and tabloids didn't want to buy it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=57.12s)]
*  Michael Cohen, Trump's personal lawyer at the time, was also approached with an offer to buy Daniels' story. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  That was in September. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=67.72s)]
*  Cohen says go to hell, essentially. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=69.08s)]
*  No. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=71.6s)]
*  And then Access Hollywood happens. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=72.52s)]
*  And when you're a star, they let you do it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=74.24s)]
*  You can do anything. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=76.28s)]
*  Whatever you want. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=77.0s)]
*  Grab them by the b***h. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=77.68s)]
*  And then boom, it's like a 180. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=78.88s)]
*  Stormy's lawyer is back on the phone with Cohen and they're hashing out a deal. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=80.68s)]
*  Daniels agrees to $130,000 for her story in exchange for her silence and signs a contract on October 28, 2016. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  Journal reporters caught wind of Daniels around this time and over months, worked to piece the story of the payment together. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=92.76s)]
*  So the first story ran in January 2018. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  It was pretty bare bones. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  I mean, what we said is what we knew, which is that Michael Cohen had arranged $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=104.12s)]
*  And so we had confirmed that he'd used the Delaware Limited Liability Company, a shell company, essentially to transfer the payment. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=109.56s)]
*  And so those are the two stories that we reported in 2018 that really got the ball rolling. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=114.84s)]
*  A political firestorm erupted. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=119.12s)]
*  Trump denied the affair and knowledge of the payment. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=121.4s)]
*  Days later, FBI agents raided Cohen's home, which Trump called. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=130.04s)]
*  Disgraceful situation. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  It's a total witch hunt. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=135.32s)]
*  I've been saying it for a long time. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=136.4s)]
*  Federal prosecutors charged Cohen with campaign finance violations and other federal crimes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=138.08s)]
*  He pleaded guilty to all of the charges, telling a federal judge at the time that Trump had directed him to buy Daniels' silence. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=142.96s)]
*  I am providing the committee today with several documents, and these include a copy of a check Mr. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=150.56s)]
*  Trump wrote from his personal bank account after he became president to reimburse me for the hush money payments I made [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  to cover up his affair with an adult film star and to prevent damage to his campaign. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=167.48s)]
*  Despite Cohen implicating Trump in the crime, federal prosecutors dropped the case. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=173.84s)]
*  But that still left the possibility of state charges, as the Trump organization is based in New York. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=178.67999999999998s)]
*  Cyrus Vance, the Manhattan district attorney, stepped in. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=184.76s)]
*  Ultimately, the DA's office decided not to bring charges. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=188.04s)]
*  When Vance retired to the new DA, Alvin Bragg initially decided not to pursue the hush money investigation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=191.36s)]
*  There is a felony falsifying business records charge, but that requires the records to have been falsified and to conceal another crime or to commit another crime. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=197.56s)]
*  And, you know, the obvious other crime here is the campaign finance crime, the actual payoff of Stormy Daniels to protect Donald Trump's campaign. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=206.84s)]
*  But there has never been a case or a judge, a state judge has never blessed the use of felony falsifying business records premised on a federal charge. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=213.52s)]
*  In other words, these are state prosecutors that are bringing a state charge and in order to elevate it to a felony, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=223.28s)]
*  they have to say that the crime that was concealed by falsifying these business records was a federal crime. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=229.08s)]
*  So that's like a weird thing. And they decided it was going to be too risky to bring a case that was going to rely on an untested legal theory. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=234.44s)]
*  But then in January, Bragg impaneled a new grand jury to investigate the payments. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=240.4s)]
*  He hasn't said publicly why he changed course. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  Everyone's surprised, frankly, because our reporting and others have shown that the office had looked at this so many times, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=247.52s)]
*  had looked at it through kind of different lenses and decided each time not to bring it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=254.32000000000002s)]
*  The feds had passed up on the chance to bring it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=258.36s)]
*  So now here we are in 2023. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  And what's changed? I mean, we don't we don't really know yet. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=263.32s)]
*  One thing that hasn't changed is Cohen's involvement. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  Trump's former lawyer testified before the grand jury last week and could be called to speak with them again. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=269.4s)]
*  This is all about accountability. He needs to be held accountable for his dirty deeds. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=274.64s)]
*  Trump has denied the affair and any wrongdoing, calling the investigation politically motivated. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=280.28s)]
*  The Manhattan DA's office did not respond to requests for comment. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  If Bragg brings charges against the former president, it could shine more light on what happened in 2016. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  An indictment is just an allegation, right? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  There are still questions that I have even after having worked on this for so long. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=298.6s)]
*  If the charges are focused on falsifying business records, you know, like what did Trump know about repaying Cohen? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=302.84s)]
*  There's a lot of sort of gaps in our knowledge about how this all went down. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=308.6s)]
*  And then, you know, I'm really curious to see if the DA's like learned some new facts. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  Charges, if they come, I think would would sort of begin like just one more chapter. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAL95zMlWs&t=315.76s)]
