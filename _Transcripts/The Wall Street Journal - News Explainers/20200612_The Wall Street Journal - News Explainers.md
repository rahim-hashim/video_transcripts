**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 12, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA)

*  second everything unravels. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=12.64s)]
*  Since the killing of George Floyd, police departments across the country are facing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=24.8s)]

*  a crowd. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=45.8s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal analyzed over two hours of footage shot by multiple witnesses [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  as well as police scanner audio from the scene to examine how police and protester tactics [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=53.92s)]
*  push the incident into chaos. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=59.32s)]
*  An hour after a citywide curfew, about 2,000 people are headed east on Pine Street toward [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=65.16s)]
*  the Seattle Police East Precinct to protest. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=70.32s)]
*  But Seattle PD quickly erect a barrier one block away. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=78.2s)]
*  The scene still seems under control. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=82.08s)]
*  The precinct captain even listens and responds to protestor demands. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  The tone changes when an organizer warns that some people have other tactics in mind. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=94.72s)]
*  Then a crucial change in police tactics. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=111.32s)]
*  They swap the line of bike officers for officers in riot gear. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  They also discuss using pepper spray, what they refer to as OC, short for oleoresin capsicum. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=123.0s)]
*  Then a change in tactics from some protesters. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  A few at the front begin raising umbrellas, which protesters frequently use to shield [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=139.6s)]
*  themselves from pepper spray and tear gas. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=144.28s)]
*  Police experts we spoke with note that umbrellas are often seen as a hazard because they block [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=152.36s)]
*  sight lines. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=156.96s)]
*  Then, the pivotal moment. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=157.96s)]
*  A person in front is holding an umbrella that extends past the barricade. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  An officer reaches out, attempting to push it out of the way. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=163.94s)]
*  The officer grabs the umbrella and the person tries to hold on. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=173.1s)]
*  At the same time, another officer deploys pepper spray at the direction of the incident [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=179.18s)]
*  commander, or IC. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=183.02s)]
*  Other officers follow suit, spraying as the crowd backs away. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=193.3s)]
*  Some in the crowd throw objects toward the police line. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=198.34s)]
*  Then the order to deploy blast balls and CS, or tear gas. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=207.06s)]
*  Most of the protesters have dispersed at this point, but a few remain close to the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=222.86s)]
*  barrier, despite tear gas filling the air. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=226.78s)]
*  Seattle Police Department policy dictates that once a crowd poses an imminent risk to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=233.5s)]
*  public safety or property destruction, police should give an order to disperse. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=237.46s)]
*  The policy also states officers will not use blast balls until a dispersal order has been [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=243.62s)]
*  issued. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=248.46s)]
*  Footage we reviewed didn't show officers giving a verbal order. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=251.14s)]
*  The Seattle Police Department said the incident is still under investigation. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=256.86s)]
*  Police declared the June 1 protest a riot because some people in the crowd threw objects [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=261.84s)]
*  at police. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=266.41999999999996s)]
*  11 people were arrested, according to Seattle Police. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjExztMbyA&t=268.41999999999996s)]
