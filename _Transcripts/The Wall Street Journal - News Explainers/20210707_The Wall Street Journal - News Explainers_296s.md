# What’s Behind the Rental Car Shortage? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 07, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys)
*  Americans are traveling again. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=0.0s)]
*  But if your summer travel plans involve a rental car, be prepared for long lines and sticker shock. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  I think it's all over the country. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=10.48s)]
*  There isn't one area where you can find a cheap rental car. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=12.6s)]
*  Using a car right now is expensive, whether you're buying it or renting it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=16.72s)]
*  According to the travel website, Kayak, rental car prices in the first two weeks of June are up 89 percent for the July 4th [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=22.16s)]
*  weekend compared to with the same dates in 2019 and as much as 300 percent in some places. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=29.72s)]
*  But even if you decide to pony up the additional cash for a vehicle, many reservations are simply not being honored by rental agencies. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=36.92s)]
*  And travelers have reported showing up at rental counters only to be turned away because there aren't enough cars on the lot. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=44.48s)]
*  So why have rental cars become so expensive? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=51.72s)]
*  And how long can we expect these high prices to last? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=55.4s)]
*  It's a pretty classic supply and demand issue. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=59.16s)]
*  There are not a lot of rental cars to go around because these companies downsized their fleets when nobody was using them. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=61.76s)]
*  The beginning of the pandemic, travel of any kind really collapsed, particularly air travel, which the rental car companies rely on very heavily. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=68.8s)]
*  And so there was this situation where they had to react very quickly to a very rapid drop in demand. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=79.64s)]
*  For months, the pandemic transformed airports into ghost towns, which in turn wiped out about two thirds of the rental car business. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=90.44s)]
*  What happens is all of the rental car companies react quickly, sell off their cars before they lose too much value, downsized their [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=98.28s)]
*  fleets, cut costs, downsized their staff. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  I mean, find every way to pinch pennies and stay alive, really. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=109.88s)]
*  It was a it was a make or break moment for these companies. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=115.28s)]
*  To survive, many rental car agencies sold off large parts of their fleet. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=118.44s)]
*  It's a great time to sell cars, too, because new car production has still still hasn't normalized. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=122.8s)]
*  So they sold a lot of cars to build cash flow, but then they also sold cars in order to right size to demand. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  And so you had a double whammy in terms of supply getting cut. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  And then you also had Hertz go bankrupt. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=141.28s)]
*  In May of 2020, Hertz filed for bankruptcy, but Mazzari sees a silver lining in the disruption. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  COVID was a blessing in disguise for this industry because it created pricing discipline and supply discipline. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=152.92s)]
*  These companies basically had to cut their fleet size down by 35 percent. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=159.88s)]
*  So this was a dysfunctional oligopoly. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=165.16s)]
*  Supply was never tight. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=168.6s)]
*  This summer, consumer demand has returned and now a new problem has arisen. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=170.48s)]
*  There's an extreme shortage of new cars. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=175.44s)]
*  When demand came back, it did not trickle back. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=178.12s)]
*  It came back almost overnight. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=180.6s)]
*  And you have these companies that have right sized themselves to a market that basically wasn't using them before. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=182.72s)]
*  And they just weren't prepared. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=191.52s)]
*  We're also hearing is that these companies are so desperate to get fleet that they're buying cars in the used car market, which is in the auction market. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=193.6s)]
*  So don't be surprised if you get into some rental car that has a lot more miles on it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=204.56s)]
*  Exacerbating the car shortage issue is another shortage. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=209.8s)]
*  Semiconductors. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=213.4s)]
*  Automakers have said the production of new vehicles has been slowed because of chip shortages. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  New car production with a chip shortage isn't going to normalize until Q4. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  So for these companies, it's going to be very tough to add fleet back this year. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=224.44s)]
*  And so this year pricing is going to remain very high. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=229.56s)]
*  In separate statements to the Wall Street Journal, both Hertz and Enterprise acknowledge the customers might have a tougher time. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=232.08s)]
*  Securing a rental because of the spike in demand. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  Enterprise wrote, while still below pre-pandemic fleet levels, our fleet is not down significantly. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=242.0s)]
*  A key challenge right now is the global chip shortage impacting new car availability. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  Hertz wrote, the microchip shortage is also affecting the car rental industry. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=254.4s)]
*  But Hertz is working closely with our automotive partners to add new vehicles to our fleet as quickly as possible, while also moving vehicles to the areas with highest demand. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=259.24s)]
*  If you have to rent a car this summer, Mazzari recommends booking early and booking backwards. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=269.24s)]
*  Typically, travelers book flights or hotels first, but that strategy won't work this year. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=275.24s)]
*  Essentially, you just have to book in advance and kind of pay up for it and be prepared for that, you know, if you're lucky enough to get one. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU3oV6Zhys&t=281.24s)]
