# Cash Is Back. Here's Why  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 09, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI)
*  As stocks continue to climb, investors are putting more of their money in cash. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=0.0s)]
*  This chart looks at how much cash investors have in money market accounts. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=6.0s)]
*  In the past three years, the total has climbed by $1 trillion to $3.4 trillion, the highest level in about a decade. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=10.0s)]
*  Cash is sometimes viewed as a safe but boring investment. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=18.0s)]
*  But lately, it's looking a lot shinier than it has in a while. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=22.0s)]
*  And not just to investors. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=26.0s)]
*  Analysts say if you park your cash in the right account, it can earn higher returns without taking on more risk. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=28.0s)]
*  Just kind of the holy grail of investing. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=34.0s)]
*  We'll explain. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=37.0s)]
*  When investors talk about cash, they mean funds that you can quickly and easily spend or turn into physical money. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=45.0s)]
*  It's all about liquidity. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=51.0s)]
*  Cash accounts let you withdraw funds in a flash if you need to, say, fix your roof or pay a medical expense. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=53.0s)]
*  There are a few types of cash, including currencies, deposit accounts, and money market funds. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=59.0s)]
*  Each is a little different. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=65.0s)]
*  The cashiest type of cash is currency, the stuff from trees. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=67.0s)]
*  According to the Fed, about $1.8 trillion in U.S. currency circulates through the economy, through banks, businesses, wallets, sock drawers. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=72.0s)]
*  As an investment, though, there are downsides. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=82.0s)]
*  There's no return on cash that's stored in a sock drawer, for example. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=85.0s)]
*  And inflation, even really low inflation, will eat away at the value. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=88.0s)]
*  It's also kind of risky. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=93.0s)]
*  If you have a lot of currency, you're probably going to want to buy a safe. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=95.0s)]
*  Now, there's a lot more money in deposit accounts. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=99.0s)]
*  Let's look at savings accounts alone. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=103.0s)]
*  Cash in savings accounts at commercial banks tops $8 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=105.0s)]
*  Savings picked up around 2009, right after the market crashed in battered investment portfolios. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=111.0s)]
*  And over the past decade, savings has outpaced GDP growth, even as interest rates dropped. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=117.0s)]
*  One analyst said that low interest rates actually helped drive up savings accounts. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=123.0s)]
*  The idea is that people had less incentive to move their money from savings to other investments. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=128.0s)]
*  The returns on some government bonds, for example, were not much higher than the savings accounts. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=133.0s)]
*  Right now, the average return on savings accounts under $100,000 is about 0.09 percent. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=138.0s)]
*  But if you look around, you can do better. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=145.0s)]
*  Savings accounts at some online banks will yield you more, some around 2 percent. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=149.0s)]
*  Now, that return is more aligned with money market funds, which is our next cash investment. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=154.0s)]
*  Like we said at the beginning, there's a lot more money in money market funds lately. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=160.0s)]
*  These accounts are not insured by the FDIC like savings accounts are, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=164.0s)]
*  but they hold high rated short-term securities that tend to hold steady in value. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=168.0s)]
*  Also, unlike many savings accounts, money market funds often require minimum deposits. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=173.0s)]
*  They also charge management fees and limit the number of transactions you can make each month. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=179.0s)]
*  But over the past few years, returns have grown. Here they are since 2009. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=184.0s)]
*  After years near zero, in 2015, rates on money market funds started rising along with the Fed's interest rate increases. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=191.0s)]
*  They then dropped a little when the central bank reduced rates a little earlier this year. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=199.0s)]
*  But returns are still higher than you'll get at your average savings account. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=203.0s)]
*  Some analysts say that the surge in money market account balances shows that investors are feeling cautious. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=207.0s)]
*  They may have concerns about the broader economy. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=213.0s)]
*  The trade war with China and just mixed economic data have sparked bouts of volatility in the markets, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=216.0s)]
*  and that's pushed investors toward safer assets. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=222.0s)]
*  But others say all the cash on the sidelines indicates good health. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=225.0s)]
*  It shows investors are not overly excited about stocks and that they'll have money to invest when prices drop. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=229.0s)]
*  One thing that is clear is that as stocks and bonds keep rising, investors are looking at cash again seriously, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=235.0s)]
*  for the first time since the financial crisis. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=242.0s)]
*  You might even say, cash is back. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQg6cG2FI&t=245.0s)]
