Video Description: Modi's India is building a new base for nuclear-armed submarines in the Bay of Bengal called INS Varsha in a bid to curb China’s naval footprint growing in India’s backyard. The Bay of Bengal is a critical shipping lane and some China experts believe the waterway could play a key role in any conflict over Taiwan or the South China Sea. 

WSJ examined satellite images to see how INS Varsha has expanded and explores how this project is forming the backbone of New Delhi’s plans to keep Beijing’s ambitions in the region in check.

# India Aims to Counter China With This Nuclear Submarine Base  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs)
*  Beneath the tranquil shores of a coastal village on the Bay of Bengal, India is building a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=0.0s)]
*  multi-billion dollar base. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=5.66s)]
*  Designed to protect India's growing fleet of nuclear submarines in a key area of the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=8.34s)]
*  Indian Ocean, the new base, INS Farsha, has a secret design feature. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=12.74s)]
*  Its location essentially allows for the underground docking of submarines. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=18.16s)]
*  Here's why this project forms the backbone of India's plans to keep China's ambitions [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=22.78s)]
*  in the region in check. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=28.16s)]
*  The Bay of Bengal lies north of critical shipping lanes that carry around 30% of all globally [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=31.5s)]
*  traded goods towards this narrow waterway known as the Strait of Malacca. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=37.14s)]
*  And around 80% of China's oil imports pass through this critical choke point. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=43.0s)]
*  The Strait of Malacca can be controlled by a number of powers which China might plausibly [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=48.44s)]
*  find itself in a conflict with. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=54.86s)]
*  First and foremost, the United States Navy, but also secondarily, the Indian Navy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=57.1s)]
*  Some China experts believe the waterway could play a key role in any conflict over Taiwan [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=63.1s)]
*  or the South China Sea. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=69.18s)]
*  One of the ways in which China has tried to reduce its perceived vulnerabilities in this [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=71.56s)]
*  space is by building a growing naval presence in the northern Indian Ocean. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=76.62s)]
*  Over the years, China has been building and investing in commercial ports in Myanmar, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=81.86s)]
*  Bangladesh and Sri Lanka through its Belt and Road Initiative, the infrastructure project [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  Beijing has been promoting since 2013 in more than 150 countries. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  Chinese vessels, including those belonging to the People's Liberation Army or PLA, are [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=97.48s)]
*  now frequently spotted in these ports, like these two landing ships and a guided missile [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=102.2s)]
*  destroyer that visited Sri Lanka's port in late August and docked just 4,000 feet [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=107.32s)]
*  away from the Indian guided missile destroyer INS Mumbai. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=113.17999999999999s)]
*  These vessels have habituated states within the region to the idea of a Chinese naval [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=117.52s)]
*  presence. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=124.52s)]
*  Beijing has also helped Bangladesh to build the country's first ever full-fledged submarine [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=126.02s)]
*  base. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=130.9s)]
*  The BNS Sheikh Hasina naval base is still under construction but was inaugurated in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=132.02s)]
*  2023. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=137.22s)]
*  And at least one of Bangladesh's first two submarines, also made in China, appears to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=138.9s)]
*  already be stationed there. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=143.86s)]
*  What China's investments in both civilian ports but also military facilities can do [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=146.06s)]
*  is create access points which the PLA can rely on for more routine sustainment, which [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=151.70000000000002s)]
*  in turn can allow it to embark on more prolonged deployments in the Indian Ocean region. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=158.26s)]
*  Satellite images showing the expansion of INS Varsha reveal India's efforts to counterbalance [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=165.0s)]
*  China's growing presence in its own backyard. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=170.82s)]
*  The most important part of the base will be the underground facilities within which Indian [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=174.66s)]
*  submarines can dock towards the right-hand side of the photo. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=179.85999999999999s)]
*  The ability to build tunnels offer advantages both in terms of hardening but also protection [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=184.4s)]
*  against adversary surveillance. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  And its location on the Bay of Bengal itself offers significant tactical advantages for [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=192.84s)]
*  India. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=198.08s)]
*  It's relatively close to a number of Indian air bases. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=199.08s)]
*  It's an area in which the Indian Navy enjoys considerable local superiority over the People's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=202.78s)]
*  Liberation Army Navy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=209.28s)]
*  And it's ringed on three sides by either India's own territory or states that are neutral or [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=211.22s)]
*  partially aligned with India, although obviously there's an ongoing competition with China [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=218.1s)]
*  for influence in many of these states. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=224.28s)]
*  Military experts say the base will eventually host up to a dozen nuclear submarines. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=227.38s)]
*  India currently only has two. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=232.12s)]
*  Both are Arihant-class ballistic missile submarines or SSBN. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=233.86s)]
*  The newest one, INS Arihant, can carry 12 ballistic missiles with a range of around [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  430 miles or four ballistic missiles that can travel beyond 2,000 miles, putting China's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=244.12s)]
*  naval base in Hainan well within the range. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  India's third SSBN should be ready in 2025. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=254.32s)]
*  But India still lags far behind China, which already has 12 nuclear submarines. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=258.58s)]
*  India doubtless would like to change this balance in the future. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=265.2s)]
*  That being said, comparing numbers of like-for-like platforms is not necessarily the best way [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=268.32s)]
*  to look at a military balance because geography and missions determine which platforms are [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=274.3s)]
*  most relevant. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=279.46s)]
*  The question is not simply how many submarines of each type each country operates. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=280.52s)]
*  It's also one of reach because obviously operating closer to Indian shores, many of India's diesel [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=286.38s)]
*  electric submarines are within operating ranges where they can be pretty effective [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=292.48s)]
*  against Chinese attack submarines. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  The Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn't respond to requests for comment on how New [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=301.18s)]
*  Delhi perceives China's activities in the region. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=305.6s)]
*  China's foreign ministry said Beijing's cooperation in the region is not targeted at any third [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=309.20000000000005s)]
*  party. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  Even if Chinese engagement doesn't necessarily represent a military threat in the sense that [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=315.4s)]
*  it can enable the PLA Navy to fight in the region, what it can enable and why the Indian [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=323.4s)]
*  government and Navy are perturbed by it is because it can enable a more sustained presence [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=330.56s)]
*  in the region that can set the preconditions for China to eventually be a much more credible [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=337.79999999999995s)]
*  military player in the Indian Ocean than it is today. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=344.48s)]
*  The expansion of India's nuclear submarine project comes as Beijing and New Delhi agree [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  to de-escalate another area of tension on the Himalayan border. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS9MXoaE5cs&t=353.04s)]
