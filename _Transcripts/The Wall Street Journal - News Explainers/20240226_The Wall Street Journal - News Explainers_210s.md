# India Unrest: Why Farmers Are Protesting Ahead of Election | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE)
*  Thousands of farmers in India are blocking highways and holding massive protests. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=0.0s)]
*  Demonstrators clashed with police as they tried to reach the capital, New Delhi. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=7.0s)]
*  This is the second major tussle between farmers and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government just months before national elections. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=12.0s)]
*  So here's what's behind the protests and what they reveal about the challenges India faces to transform its economy. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=20.0s)]
*  Farmers in northern India began marching towards Delhi on February 13th and they have a couple of different demands. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=29.0s)]
*  The biggest one, the most important one, is that they want the government to act as kind of a guarantee for more crops that they grow. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=36.0s)]
*  Right now in India there is something called a minimum support price. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=46.0s)]
*  That really helps farmers when prices crash and they know that the government will step in to buy, at least for rice and wheat, some of their crop. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=50.0s)]
*  And that can help them cover their costs and is a protection for a lot of farmers. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=58.0s)]
*  But the problem is that other kinds of crops don't get that same benefit. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=62.0s)]
*  So the farmers and the government have been meeting several times in an attempt to get the farmers to kind of go back home. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=66.0s)]
*  And right now they're camped out around the borders of different states. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=73.0s)]
*  The government doesn't really want to extend this legal guarantee to other kinds of crops. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=77.0s)]
*  And the reason being that it does actually cost quite a bit of money to do that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=81.0s)]
*  So they had come up with an offer to guarantee buying for a few crops that the farmers were talking about and only to do it for maybe five years. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=85.0s)]
*  So basically they're offering more of a short-term proposal and the farmers were not really happy with that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=95.0s)]
*  They felt like it really wouldn't give them the kind of security that they're looking for. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=100.0s)]
*  This is actually the second confrontation between the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the farmers. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=105.0s)]
*  In late 2020, farmers' protests ended up lasting more than a year. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=111.0s)]
*  There is some interconnections between these farm protests and the overall plans for the economy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=117.0s)]
*  You know, some people say that there are an unusually large number of people in India still today very dependent on farming. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=122.0s)]
*  And usually when countries grow and develop, many people come out of farming and then they go into other kinds of jobs in cities. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=128.0s)]
*  And this happened in China, this happened in the US. So we've seen that happen all over the world. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=134.0s)]
*  This is something that's really important for the government. They talk about it a lot. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=138.0s)]
*  They talk about jobs and they talk about the challenge of making India into a different kind of economy, just a much bigger economy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=141.0s)]
*  They want other kinds of jobs to take the place so that people are not so dependent on the vagaries of farming. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=147.0s)]
*  What some economists say is that that is not happening fast enough. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=153.0s)]
*  We are seeing investments and we are seeing factories, but India would need to create millions and millions of jobs because it has so many young people. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=157.0s)]
*  India is expected to go to the polls in April and May, and farmers probably felt that this would be a good time to put some pressure on the government. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=164.0s)]
*  Farmers are possibly one of the most important political forces in India. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=174.0s)]
*  There are some 260 million people working as farm workers in India. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=177.0s)]
*  That's a very big number of people that depend on this. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=182.0s)]
*  I think that the government would be worried from that perspective. They wouldn't want it to become snowballed into something. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=185.0s)]
*  And I think from what we saw from the last time, nobody expected those protests to go on for a year. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=191.0s)]
*  So I'm sure that the government is very keen to try to find a compromise and work a way out of this with the farmers. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=195.0s)]
*  They would be really keen to show that they indeed are trying to work with them. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nopprOpv8rE&t=200.0s)]
