# How the Treasury Delays the $31 Trillion Debt Ceiling  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc)
*  An economic crisis is looming and experts are sounding the alarm, afraid of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=0.0s)]
*  a self-imposed calamity. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=6.0s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is talking about the dispute over raising the debt ceiling, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=8.2s)]
*  which hasn't happened yet. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=13.16s)]
*  Can't be negotiated over whether or not we're going to pay our bills. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=14.76s)]
*  But as the countdown to potential calamity ticks closer to zero, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=20.04s)]
*  the US Treasury is buying America more time by taking so-called extraordinary measures. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=24.16s)]
*  Because if the government hits its borrowing limit, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=29.96s)]
*  you have a real mess on your hands. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=32.64s)]
*  So what are these extraordinary measures? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=34.76s)]
*  How do they help avoid a crisis? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=37.28s)]
*  And what happens when they run out? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  First, it's important to understand what makes them extraordinary. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=42.68s)]
*  The Treasury pays the country's bills by using revenue from taxes. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=47.2s)]
*  Because it spends more than it taxes, it makes up the difference by issuing debt in the form of government securities. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  But there is a self-imposed congressional limit to how much of this debt the department can issue. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  That's the ceiling. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=62.68s)]
*  The only way to fund a deficit is to borrow more money. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=63.919999999999995s)]
*  And until it gets rid of the deficit, that debt is going to keep rising. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=67.92s)]
*  It's on Congress to raise that ceiling to allow the Treasury to issue more debt [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  and cover spending that lawmakers already approved. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=77.64s)]
*  But there's a cap on how much debt the department can issue. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=81.08s)]
*  That limit? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=84.36s)]
*  The debt ceiling. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=85.16s)]
*  The debt ceiling. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=85.84s)]
*  The debt ceiling. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=86.56s)]
*  If all of a sudden overnight you can't borrow any more money, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=87.24s)]
*  well then you start missing payments that you've promised. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=90.6s)]
*  This is where the Treasury comes in with its extraordinary measures [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  to prevent the country from reaching the debt ceiling. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=96.36s)]
*  The Treasury uses these extraordinary measures because it's got no alternative. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=99.32s)]
*  If it can't borrow more money, it's got to find the money somewhere. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  So the Treasury accesses other funds it has tucked away, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=106.52s)]
*  pulling money from one area to use for more pressing spending needs in another. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=109.64s)]
*  Imagine that you have an envelope hidden away in a drawer with a bunch of cash in it [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=114.24s)]
*  to deal with a crisis. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=119.32s)]
*  This is the envelope. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=120.6s)]
*  But how does the Treasury get that cash? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=121.88s)]
*  One way is by using money it has stowed away for its own retirees. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=124.56s)]
*  On January 19th, Yellen announced the Treasury would be redeeming investments [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=129.2s)]
*  from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=133.16s)]
*  and the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=135.76s)]
*  They're one of the tools in the envelope. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  Pulling investments doesn't shut down these funds [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  or mean that retirees won't get their payments. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=144.04s)]
*  It does mean that these funds will be tapped now while extraordinary measures continue. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=146.88s)]
*  Another way is by pausing investments. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=152.16s)]
*  On January 23rd, Yellen paused investments in the Government Securities Investment Fund, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=155.0s)]
*  which is invested in short-term U.S. Treasury securities. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=160.04s)]
*  In addition, the Treasury can pause payments to government funds [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=163.72s)]
*  that don't have to immediately pay beneficiaries. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=167.12s)]
*  But the Treasury doesn't just take and pause without refilling the envelope. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=169.92s)]
*  Typically, after the debt ceiling is increased, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=174.96s)]
*  they'll borrow money from the public, from bond investors, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=177.44s)]
*  and then replenish those pension accounts that it's taken from. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=180.76s)]
*  However, the Treasury's extraordinary measures are temporary, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  meant only to tide the government over until the debt ceiling is raised. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  At the end of the day, Congress simply has to act to raise the debt ceiling. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=191.6s)]
*  House Republicans, on the other hand, want to use the debt ceiling as leverage [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=195.84s)]
*  to force a debate with Democrats about cutting spending to curb future debt. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you sit before a four-star general. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=204.28s)]
*  They'll tell you the debt is the greatest threat to this nation. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  This has become something of a recurring political fight. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=211.0s)]
*  Let's pay our bills, not torch our economy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  In the past, they've always raised the debt ceiling [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  and tried to get back to some state of normalcy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=221.28s)]
*  If they run out of funds in using these extraordinary measures [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=223.72s)]
*  and they haven't run the debt ceiling, then they don't pay their bills. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=227.92s)]
*  Yellen said that she expected them to keep the government [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=231.64s)]
*  from hitting the debt ceiling until early June. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=234.16s)]
*  If the ceiling isn't raised and the Treasury can't meet all of its obligations, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=237.16s)]
*  the U.S. defaults. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=241.48s)]
*  It's called the ex-state, and it's never happened in American history. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=243.28s)]
*  So what would happen? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=247.12s)]
*  Bondholders don't get paid interest. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=249.28s)]
*  Retirees don't get paid. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=251.08s)]
*  Social security funds, contractors don't get paid for military spending. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  And then you've got a real mess on your hands. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=258.64s)]
*  That mess could cause a disaster in financial markets. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=260.6s)]
*  It is possible for markets to become quite concerned [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=264.48s)]
*  about whether or not the U.S. will pay its bills [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=269.48s)]
*  before the day of reckoning comes. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=273.48s)]
*  That could even mean a possible credit downgrade. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  One of the last times we had a moment like this was [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=279.16s)]
*  Standard & Poor's downgraded the AAA credit rating on U.S. Treasury securities. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=281.24s)]
*  After witnessing a month of wrangling over raising the debt ceiling, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=286.76s)]
*  they doubted our political system's ability to act. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=291.2s)]
*  There are real consequences if we get to a moment [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=294.32s)]
*  where extraordinary measures are exhausted [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=297.12s)]
*  and the U.S. has no way to continue to fund its budget deficits. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=299.72s)]
*  The Treasury says the U.S. won't reach the ex-state until this summer. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=304.24s)]
*  In the meantime, the Treasury will continue implementing extraordinary measures [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=308.16s)]
*  until the debt ceiling is raised or that emergency envelope is empty. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HPF0RDXSKc&t=312.44s)]
