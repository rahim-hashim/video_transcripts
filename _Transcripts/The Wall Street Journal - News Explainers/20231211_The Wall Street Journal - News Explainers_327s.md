# How Microfactories Could Be the Manufacturing Strategy of the Future  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4)
*  This may look like just another car factory, but it's actually a new micro factory, manned [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=0.0s)]
*  by autonomous robot dogs and robotic arms monitored by AI. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=8.8s)]
*  It's designed to change the way cars are produced, and it's been built in the heart of one of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=15.08s)]
*  the smallest and most expensive countries in the world, Singapore. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=19.04s)]
*  Typically car manufacturers don't build car factories in dense urban cities like Singapore, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=24.12s)]
*  but here it's going to be different from most car factories. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=29.48s)]
*  Robots are going to do a lot of the manufacturing, and it's going to be a much more flexible [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=32.4s)]
*  model. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=37.08s)]
*  Microfactories reinvent the way cars are made by automating most of the process and building [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=39.36s)]
*  them in a cell rather than along a production line. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  This could be the future in which we talk in a couple of years from now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Microfactories are one of the biggest changes to car making in a generation, and if the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=52.0s)]
*  concept is proven, it could shape the future of the industry. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  For over 100 years, cars have been built in large plants, manned by hundreds of workers. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=61.48s)]
*  The trend has been towards building bigger factories. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=66.56s)]
*  Tesla's Gigafactory facility, located near Austin, Texas, covers more than 10 million [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=69.44s)]
*  square feet of factory floor space and has a capacity to build more than 250,000 vehicles [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=74.88s)]
*  a year. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=80.28s)]
*  By comparison, Hyundai's new Microfactory in Singapore stands just over 935,000 square [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=81.48s)]
*  feet. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=86.64s)]
*  The car makers to the plant could produce up to 30,000 cars a year. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=87.64s)]
*  Hyundai has pushed aside the traditional assembly process to allow for a much smaller footprint. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  Behind me there are robots that are putting together the final finishing touches on a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  car. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=101.44s)]
*  Typically in a more conventional manufacturing process that would actually largely be done [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=102.44s)]
*  by humans. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=106.0s)]
*  It would be done in a long assembly line, which doesn't allow for much customization. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=107.28s)]
*  In traditional auto factories, vehicles travel along a linear path and parts are installed [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=112.76s)]
*  along an assembly line. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=117.4s)]
*  While the procedure is increasingly automated, the basic process hasn't significantly changed. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=119.36s)]
*  Here it's different. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=125.28s)]
*  It's a cell-based model, which means that there are different cells around the factory [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=126.36s)]
*  floor that are focused on different tasks, and that actually allows for a lot more automation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=130.12s)]
*  In each cell, robots are tasked with installing several components of the car before it's [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=136.76000000000002s)]
*  moved to the next zone. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=141.28s)]
*  Cells can be modified with different instructions, from installing parts in an identical car [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  design to assembling a different vehicle altogether. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  Hyundai says that more than 50% of the manufacturing process at a Singapore Microfactory is done [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  by robots. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=157.12s)]
*  Automated ground vehicles move the cars around the factory. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=158.84s)]
*  While four-legged robots equipped with AI cameras monitor and analyze the assembly, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=163.08s)]
*  issues identified by the robot dogs are then fixed by human workers. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=168.28s)]
*  Even though we're a small factory, we're producing cars as a mass manufacturer. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=172.44s)]
*  So what allows us to do that is the usage of flexible automation and a large portion [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=176.24s)]
*  of systems intelligence behind to orchestrate the manufacturing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  Hyundai says because production is highly automated, only about 100 workers would be [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=189.84s)]
*  needed to produce the plant's capacity of 30,000 cars per year. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=194.08s)]
*  That means a worker at the Microfactory could produce two to three times the number of cars [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  compared to a person in a traditional factory. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=201.88000000000002s)]
*  For sure we will still need large-scale factories. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=205.08s)]
*  We will still need to produce as many cars as possible in the most effective way when [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=208.36s)]
*  it comes to overall mobility. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=212.54000000000002s)]
*  But we feel that the answer is not only that, and that in an urban environment, having a [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=215.46s)]
*  smaller factory that allows us to produce as many different types of mobility devices [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=220.14000000000001s)]
*  in a cost-effective way is absolutely critical. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=225.98000000000002s)]
*  Hyundai's plant in Singapore is the country's first auto factory in over 40 years. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=229.02s)]
*  While Microfactories could allow wealthier countries to rebuild manufacturing industries, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=234.22s)]
*  the move toward greater automation will mean fewer manual jobs for workers. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=238.70000000000002s)]
*  In a typical assembly plant, you would think for the assembly operation of high single-digit [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=242.34s)]
*  to low double-digit percentage of automation, of automated tasks, we are at around 50% already. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=248.22s)]
*  When it comes to logistics, the provision at the right time of the right part to the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=254.58s)]
*  right cell is again something where we've automated over 60% already. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=261.1s)]
*  It's also in very low double-digit in other factories. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=266.38s)]
*  It's essentially manual. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=269.9s)]
*  Microfactories are largely untested ground for the auto industry. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  Arrival, an EV startup producing vans, has committed to manufacturing their vehicles [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=276.1s)]
*  out of Microfactories. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=280.62s)]
*  However, the company has only delivered a small number of the vehicles it forecasted [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=282.18s)]
*  out of its plant in the UK. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=286.3s)]
*  Arrival has struggled to ramp up production and have pushed back a planned second Microfactory [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=288.22s)]
*  in the US. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=293.26s)]
*  For now, Hyundai says it's the only major carmaker to start building vehicles out of one. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=295.06s)]
*  We have a thesis for the future of mobility. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=300.34s)]
*  As we test the market, if we realize that this is right, you could see smart urban mobility [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=302.94s)]
*  hubs in many different urban environments. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=308.85999999999996s)]
*  While the concept behind Microfactories remains unproven at a mass scale, they provide a glimpse [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=311.82s)]
*  into what carmaking could look like as the industry heads towards a future that is more [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmvIuzbR4&t=316.65999999999997s)]
