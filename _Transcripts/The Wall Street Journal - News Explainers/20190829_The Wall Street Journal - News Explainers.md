# Why WeWork's Business Model Is Risky  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 29, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8)
*  WeWork's IPO is coming as soon as next month. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=0.0s)]
*  Investors might rightly be wondering if it's a bridge to nowhere. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=4.08s)]
*  This is obviously an unprofitable company. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=7.88s)]
*  We've seen a number of these companies come to market this year with actually mixed results. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=9.96s)]
*  A lot of numbers are swirling around. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=14.96s)]
*  But if you really want to understand WeWork's business model, look at this one. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=16.8s)]
*  $47 billion. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=20.56s)]
*  That's how much the company is on the hook for in lease obligations leading up to its public offering. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  It says a lot about how the company works and why some investors are eyeing the risks. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=28.8s)]
*  You probably know WeWork, which recently changed its name to the We Company, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=38.4s)]
*  as an office space with a specific aesthetic. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=41.92s)]
*  You know what we're talking about. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=44.8s)]
*  The glass walls, plants, cafes, mid-century style furniture. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=46.36s)]
*  WeWork's basic business model is to lease large spaces, transform them to look like this, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=51.32s)]
*  and then rent them out to individuals and companies at a higher price. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=56.36s)]
*  Our software finds the best buildings in the best locations. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=59.76s)]
*  Before we even begin construction, we build full 3D models to make sure we're creating environments that allow members to thrive. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=63.92s)]
*  As of 2018, the company operated more than 35 million square feet of space globally, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=71.96s)]
*  and it currently occupies 528 locations in 29 countries around the world. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=77.6s)]
*  Speed is important because on average, we open two new locations every single day. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=84.2s)]
*  To cover the cost of the renovations and leases, WeWork charges individuals and companies through four different membership options. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=90.76s)]
*  For one of the cheaper plans, a member can bring their laptop and sit in a common area if space is available. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=97.72s)]
*  And for the most expensive plan, companies can rent out full offices, suites or entire floors. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=103.4s)]
*  WeWork also offers a service called Powered by We, full custom build-outs for larger companies. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=109.6s)]
*  So why are some analysts and investors skeptical? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, some are concerned with those lease obligations. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=119.08s)]
*  When WeWork signs a lease on a building in the U.S., they commit to an average of 15 years. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=122.72s)]
*  But WeWork's members only commit to an average of 15 months. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=127.84s)]
*  WeWork's obligations top $47.2 billion, but its customers have only signed leases on $3.4 billion worth of space. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=132.12s)]
*  Recently, the company has started signing more long-term clients. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=141.56s)]
*  But still, with 528 locations, that's a lot of time and space to fill. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=144.96s)]
*  It's unclear how much space WeWork needs to fill to break even, but the company's occupancy rate fell from 84% to about 80% in the final quarter of 2018. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=150.6s)]
*  The company said the drop was caused by expansion. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=161.2s)]
*  New offices traditionally take up to 18 months to fill. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=164.04s)]
*  But it's unclear what would happen if suddenly fewer startups and freelancers were looking for workspace, which could happen in an economic downturn. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=167.92s)]
*  It's also unclear what would happen if existing tenants started to default. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=175.44s)]
*  One place investors are looking for precedent is International Workplace Group, formerly known as Regis, a Swiss company with a similar business model to WeWork. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  During the economic downturn in the early 2000s, IWG's U.S. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=187.88s)]
*  unit filed for bankruptcy as its revenue fell, but long-term leases remained in place. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=191.68s)]
*  WeWork has said its flexible business model would help keep it safe in a downturn. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=196.96s)]
*  The company's rapid expansion has helped it stay out in front of competitors. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=202.04s)]
*  But some investors are concerned that could change. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  That's because WeWork's business model is easy to replicate. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=208.64s)]
*  The company has filed for some industrial design and furniture patent protections. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=212.24s)]
*  But anyone with enough cash can lease out industrial office space and flip it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=216.6s)]
*  And they have. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=221.44s)]
*  A New York-based rival, Notel, hit an estimated $1 billion valuation following a recent round of funding. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=222.76s)]
*  And in 2017, Blackstone acquired a majority share of the Office Group, a flexible workplace provider in the UK. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=229.24s)]
*  Investors will have to decide if WeWork's size and flexibility are enough to protect it in a period of economic uncertainty. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8&t=236.56s)]
