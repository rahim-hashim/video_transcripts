# What Coinbaseâ€™s Public Debut Means for Bitcoin and Crypto | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 14, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M)
*  Cryptocurrencies in Wall Street have mostly been operating in two separate worlds, until now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=0.0s)]
*  We are listing a stock on the Nasdaq. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=6.16s)]
*  Coinbase, the US's most popular cryptocurrency exchange, is going public, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=8.44s)]
*  and that's a big deal for both Wall Street and the crypto community. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=12.72s)]
*  Not only does it make crypto and Bitcoin a little more acceptable, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=15.96s)]
*  it actually now gives investors another way to invest in Bitcoin. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=19.64s)]
*  The company allows users to trade and store cryptocurrencies, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=24.48s)]
*  and charges fees on all transactions. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=27.88s)]
*  It profits when cryptos like Bitcoin trade higher, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=29.959999999999997s)]
*  and in the first quarter of 2021, when Bitcoin's price doubled, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=32.6s)]
*  Coinbase's revenue was $1.8 billion. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=36.44s)]
*  Coinbase's revenue being tied to Bitcoin's value has led investors to wonder [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=39.76s)]
*  if the platform's share price will be just as volatile as Bitcoin, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=43.4s)]
*  which is known for its big price swings. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=46.76s)]
*  Coinbase has said it wants to do much more than selling Bitcoin. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=49.0s)]
*  We're going to basically try to make it easy for our customers to access [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=52.44s)]
*  all the different things they might want to do with crypto. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=56.4s)]
*  The crypto industry has so far mostly grown outside of the traditional [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=58.2s)]
*  and regulated investment system, and has an image of being a risky asset, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=61.720000000000006s)]
*  also due to hacks and cybercrime. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=65.88s)]
*  This listing is meant to help legitimise it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=68.04s)]
*  So will Coinbase's public debut be a turning point for crypto? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=70.28s)]
*  Nasdaq set the reference price for Coinbase at $250, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=74.36s)]
*  which would give the company a valuation of about $65 billion. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  That's about eight times its valuation in a 2018 fundraising round. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=81.12s)]
*  To understand why the listing is making waves on Wall Street, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=85.08s)]
*  you have to understand what attracted some 56 million users to the platform. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=87.6s)]
*  When Bitcoin first emerged around 2010, it wasn't exactly easy to trade. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=92.08s)]
*  WSJ Crypto reporter Paul Vignier has been following Bitcoin and Coinbase [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=96.36s)]
*  for quite some time. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=100.11999999999999s)]
*  I've been writing about Bitcoin since 2013. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=101.44s)]
*  In the early days, you had to basically download the Bitcoin software, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=103.8s)]
*  the actual program itself, run it on your computer, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=108.16s)]
*  maintain a wallet, maintain a node on the network. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=112.11999999999999s)]
*  And for a lot of people, it was just technologically too big a deal [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=115.76s)]
*  for them to deal with, to bother with. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  Coinbase was created in 2012 and was one of several platforms [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=122.0s)]
*  that offered an easier way for people to buy, sell and store cryptocurrencies. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=125.36s)]
*  The whole point of it was to be very simple. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=129.36s)]
*  And if you look at the website, it is. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=132.76s)]
*  It is basically a very simple way to buy and sell Bitcoin. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=135.0s)]
*  The company makes money by charging a small fee when people buy or sell crypto, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=139.36s)]
*  much like a currency exchange would [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=143.44s)]
*  if you were changing, say, euros to dollars. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=144.92s)]
*  And it's these transaction fees that make up the vast bulk, 96 percent, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  of Coinbase's revenue and what has tied the company's performance [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=151.72s)]
*  directly to those crypto markets. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=155.04s)]
*  The company made some $322 million in profit last year [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=157.2s)]
*  as crypto gained more legitimacy among traditional investors. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=160.92s)]
*  Over the last year, it's become hip, right? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=164.56s)]
*  Bitcoin's usage has been sort of codified. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=167.72s)]
*  That really opened the door for a lot of professional money managers, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=171.4s)]
*  institutional money, hedge funds, to come in and start playing [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=175.0s)]
*  in this little exciting sandbox. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=178.96s)]
*  And then in 2021, crypto has matured to a point where we wanted to be able [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=181.52s)]
*  to share with all investors and all the public, actually, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  how far the industry has come. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=189.12s)]
*  And we thought one way we could do that was by going public. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=190.52s)]
*  Rather than going public through an IPO, the company has decided instead [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  to do it via a direct listing, like companies like Spotify and Palantir. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=195.72000000000003s)]
*  That means that they'll save the money that they would have paid [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=199.68s)]
*  to investment banks, but their shares will be sold by whoever currently owns them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=201.56s)]
*  So the company won't directly make any money in the process. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  What makes Coinbase's listing really unique is that it's the first time [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  a listed company's stock performance will be so closely linked to crypto markets. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=211.72s)]
*  This is the first sort of direct connection [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=215.8s)]
*  between the capital markets and the Bitcoin markets. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  While there are some small crypto-based companies that trade publicly [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=222.16s)]
*  in the US and overseas, Non handles as much crypto as Coinbase, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  which has some $223 billion of assets on its platform. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=228.76s)]
*  That's why its share price is expected to follow the path of its main currencies, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  Bitcoin and Ethereum, and that could provide a unique opportunity [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=236.2s)]
*  for traditional investors. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=239.72s)]
*  You can almost look at the stock as an index on crypto currencies. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  If you are a mainstream stock investor and you really don't want to deal [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  with Bitcoin itself, you can buy Coinbase stock. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=250.92s)]
*  It will be part of the daily conversation now. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=254.28s)]
*  What did Coinbase stock do today? Was it up? Was it down? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=259.36s)]
*  Although crypto price swings can be enticing to investors seeking high volatility, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  for Coinbase, having its share price tied to that fluctuating market [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=266.88s)]
*  creates a lot of risk and may put off some investors. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=270.24s)]
*  If you think the Dow had a bad day, Bitcoin's was worse. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=273.4s)]
*  It wasn't just Bitcoin getting bashed. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=275.88s)]
*  At one point, the global cryptocurrency market lost over $100 billion in just 24 hours. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=277.2s)]
*  Equities going higher, Bitcoin going lower. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=282.24s)]
*  In 2019, when the price of Bitcoin fell, Coinbase lost some $30 million. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=285.08s)]
*  In Coinbase's regulatory filing for the direct listing, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=289.8s)]
*  they had a very long section on risk. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=294.44s)]
*  They understand that Bitcoin is going to go up and down. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=297.76s)]
*  And it's not just volatility that makes Bitcoin risky. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=300.6s)]
*  The currency has a long chequered history of being linked to cybercrime, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=303.2s)]
*  hacking and theft. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=306.32s)]
*  Coinbase has never been hacked. I have to be clear about that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=307.68s)]
*  That's a really big deal. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=311.32s)]
*  But if Coinbase was ever hacked, if their security was breached, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=313.23999999999995s)]
*  if Bitcoins were ever outright stolen from the wallet that people have on Coinbase, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  from their accounts, that would be a disaster for Coinbase. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=321.76s)]
*  We always want to keep cyber security top of mind. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=326.0s)]
*  We've got a cybercrime insurance policy against that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=328.55999999999995s)]
*  But it doesn't mean that cybersecurity is not a big, big threat. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=330.88s)]
*  We have to keep in mind all the time. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=333.47999999999996s)]
*  To try and distance itself from the risks of Bitcoin, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=334.79999999999995s)]
*  Coinbase says it has built out a $1 billion war chest [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=337.2s)]
*  and has started to offer a wider range of products that it can sell to its consumers. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  Coinbase is where a retail app where people have their primary financial account, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=344.44s)]
*  but we have an exchange underneath that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=349.24s)]
*  We have a custodian under that. We have an institutional business. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=350.68s)]
*  We also have a commerce merchant payments business. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=353.48s)]
*  They're prepared to ride the ups and downs, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=355.68s)]
*  but they also want to build a bigger boat to deal with those ups and downs in the future. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=357.64000000000004s)]
*  Those investing in Coinbase are betting that Bitcoin will continue to grow [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  and gain more legitimacy. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  But if the currency were to crash, as of now, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=367.28s)]
*  that could be a big problem for the reputation of both crypto and Coinbase. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=369.35999999999996s)]
*  I think it's really important to remember that historically, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=373.35999999999996s)]
*  Bitcoin has gone through a few periods like this [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=376.55999999999995s)]
*  where the price has gone very, very high and come crashing down. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=380.11999999999995s)]
*  Just because Coinbase is now public, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=383.35999999999996s)]
*  just because Bitcoin's perception has been changed in the markets, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=385.44s)]
*  that doesn't mean that Bitcoin is never going to go down again. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMFbSswsV9M&t=389.64s)]
