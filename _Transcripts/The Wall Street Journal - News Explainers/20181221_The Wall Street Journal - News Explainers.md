# How Russian Trolls Took Over Americans' Instagram Accounts
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 21, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw)
*  In new Senate-backed reports out this week, we learned about the most liked Instagram post by Russian trolls. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a photo of women's shoes posted by the Russian account Blaxtagram, and it appears to have nothing to do with politics. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=6.0s)]
*  But there's a lot more to this post than meets the eye. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=13.0s)]
*  And the backstory gives us a glimpse of how Russian operatives used sophisticated schemes to take advantage of American businesses and their social media following. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=16.0s)]
*  Take a closer look at the words accompanying the post. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=25.0s)]
*  See this link to a different Instagram account, Expression Tees? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=28.0s)]
*  That's important. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=32.0s)]
*  Expression Tees is a real Pennsylvania business owned by this man, Stephen Austin. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=33.0s)]
*  He sells all kinds of t-shirts and products, including ones that promote the Black Lives Matter movement. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=38.0s)]
*  In the spring of 2017, a few weeks before that Instagram post about shoes went viral, Austin got an interesting message. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=44.0s)]
*  It said it was from a group of social media managers focused on helping the black community. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=51.0s)]
*  They were offering a social media management service for a monthly rate starting at $300 a month. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=57.0s)]
*  Austin began talking to the group, which called itself Your Digital Face. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=63.0s)]
*  A website for Your Digital Face offers more details about its so-called service. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=68.0s)]
*  It said the group managed 50 Instagram accounts with a total of 2.5 million followers. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=73.0s)]
*  And it featured examples of the pages it promoted, including Afro Kingdom, Black Business, and American Veterans. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=79.0s)]
*  What Austin didn't know at the time was that a bunch of accounts Your Digital Face said it ran were linked to the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=86.0s)]
*  the Russian troll farm that was charged this year by special counsel Robert Mueller for interfering in the U.S. election. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=94.0s)]
*  Since he had no marketing expertise and was busy running his company, Austin said Your Digital Face was worth a shot. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=100.0s)]
*  He started communicating with them over Skype, which said they were in California. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=106.0s)]
*  And he soon sent them $300 a month and his Instagram login credentials so they could promote his page. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=111.0s)]
*  That PayPal account was later revealed to be used by the Russian trolls. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=117.0s)]
*  A few weeks after he signed up, that popular post about shoes blew up, with expression tees linked in the text. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=121.0s)]
*  It got hundreds of thousands of likes. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=128.0s)]
*  In an email, Your Digital Face told Austin it had given him a shout-out on the page, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=131.0s)]
*  and it encouraged him to buy more shout-outs in order to boost his followers. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=136.0s)]
*  Austin said he didn't pay for any additional shout-outs, but we talked to other people who did. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=140.0s)]
*  Austin said his page was gaining enough traction with the monthly service, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=145.0s)]
*  so he continued paying Your Digital Face until red flags started cropping up months later. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=149.0s)]
*  In the fall of 2017, Austin said he started getting notifications that the group was trying to log into his account from places all over the world, including Ukraine. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=154.0s)]
*  Frustrated with the problems it was causing, he eventually cut ties with Your Digital Face. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=163.0s)]
*  Just months after that, email and PayPal accounts connected to Your Digital Face became public in an indictment of the Russian troll farm, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=169.0s)]
*  and this summer Austin said he got a visit from the FBI telling him he was a victim. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=176.0s)]
*  The FBI declined to comment, and Russia has denied interfering in U.S. politics. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=181.0s)]
*  So why did Russian operatives go after Austin's business account and others like it? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=186.0s)]
*  Experts say it could have been done for a variety of reasons. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=191.0s)]
*  It may have helped Russian trolls map out social networks and gather information about Americans. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=195.0s)]
*  It could have also helped them finance their interference operations through service fees, and make their fake accounts appear more legitimate. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=200.0s)]
*  Instagram said it reviewed Your Digital Face's activity and determined that its services violated the platform's terms of use. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=208.0s)]
*  While the .com version of Your Digital Face went dark in recent months, a similar Russian URL is still active. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=216.0s)]
*  And despite Austin having ended his relationship with the group, it still says that Austin's business, Expression Tees, is a client. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowjgV75fXw&t=222.0s)]
