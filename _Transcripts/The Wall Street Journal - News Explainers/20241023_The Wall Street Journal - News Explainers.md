# What Harris and Trump Podcast Appearances Say About Their Campaigns  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets)
*  She's the worst vice president ever. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=0.0s)]
*  He's the worst president ever. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=2.52s)]
*  A deadly combination. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=4.16s)]
*  There are now 20 states with Trump abortion bans. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=5.72s)]
*  In the past few months, Vice President Harris [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=9.32s)]
*  and former President Trump have been on a podcasting blitz. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=11.56s)]
*  Apparently I'm 40 seconds late, you're right. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=14.32s)]
*  Well, you are black. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=16.04s)]
*  President of the United States. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  But I said, who is it? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=18.32s)]
*  That's Joe Biden wanting to do an interview. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=19.52s)]
*  They've been all over the place, in our ears, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=21.76s)]
*  appearing on a range of programs. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=23.96s)]
*  And that is not something we've seen [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=25.48s)]
*  in the past few election cycles. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=27.12s)]
*  That's because the media landscape [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=28.84s)]
*  has been turned upside down. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=30.28s)]
*  Political candidates see much more benefit [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=32.52s)]
*  in going right to listeners wherever they are [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=34.44s)]
*  in a way to circumvent the traditional legacy media. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=36.68s)]
*  Now, which podcasts they're appearing on [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=40.04s)]
*  and what they're saying, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=41.96s)]
*  and especially what they're not saying, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=42.8s)]
*  should tell us a lot about the message [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=44.8s)]
*  they're seeking to deliver in the final weeks [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=46.6s)]
*  leading up to the election. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=48.72s)]
*  Let's start with Vice President Harris. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=50.56s)]
*  Harris reached out to listeners [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=53.36s)]
*  when she appeared on Alex Cooper's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=54.64s)]
*  Call Her Daddy podcast in early October. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  The show's audience is overwhelmingly Gen Z women, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=58.8s)]
*  a group that represents over four million [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  new registered voters since the 2022 midterm elections. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=64.36s)]
*  Cooper asked Harris about a dig from Arkansas governor, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  Sarah Huckabee Sanders. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=70.39999999999999s)]
*  I saw the governor of Arkansas said, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=71.92s)]
*  my kids keep me humble. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=75.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, Kamala Harris [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=77.16s)]
*  doesn't have anything keeping her humble. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=79.24s)]
*  How did that make you feel? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=82.4s)]
*  I don't think she understands [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  that there are a whole lot of women out here [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=86.0s)]
*  who one, are not aspiring to be humble, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  two, a whole lot of women out here [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=94.84s)]
*  who have a lot of love in their life, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=98.2s)]
*  family in their life and children in their life. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=102.68s)]
*  And I think it's really important [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=105.76s)]
*  for women to lift each other up. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=107.76s)]
*  Harris is already doing well [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=111.12s)]
*  with young female voters, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=112.76s)]
*  but here she's appealing directly to Gen Z female voters [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=114.2s)]
*  because she wants to try to offset the male vote [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=117.68s)]
*  that's expected to come in overwhelmingly [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=120.36s)]
*  for former President Trump. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  Harris is also trying to appeal [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=123.84s)]
*  to another niche voter group, black men. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=125.36s)]
*  This is one where Democrats have traditionally done very well, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  but former President Trump has made surprising inroads [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  in the past year. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  So she went on Charlemagne the God's podcast, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  The Breakfast Club. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=137.36s)]
*  You've been criticized by him and others [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=138.56s)]
*  for your lack of engagement to the black church. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=141.16s)]
*  Knowing that the black church is an unrivaled place [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  in the heart of black people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=149.36s)]
*  What could you speak to as it relates [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=151.52s)]
*  to a future Harris administration? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=153.68s)]
*  Donald Trump and his followers spend full time [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=156.96s)]
*  trying to suggest that the measure [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=160.68s)]
*  of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  which is absolutely contrary to the church I know. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=165.08s)]
*  He sells Bibles though. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=168.4s)]
*  Where our church and my church [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=169.4s)]
*  is about saying true leadership, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=172.72s)]
*  the measure of that is based on who you lift up. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=174.84s)]
*  And right, and then he's selling $60 Bible [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=178.08s)]
*  or tennis shoes and trying to play people as though [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=183.0s)]
*  that makes him more understanding [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=188.08s)]
*  of the black community, come on. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=189.68s)]
*  Democrats are concerned that black men [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=191.6s)]
*  will not turn out to vote for Harris [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=193.52s)]
*  the same way that young black women [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=195.56s)]
*  will turn out to vote for Harris. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  And so she's appealing directly [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=198.44s)]
*  to these young black men in the podcast. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=200.36s)]
*  A few days before this appearance, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  she rolled out a policy platform [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=204.72s)]
*  that she hoped would appeal directly to black men. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  This includes a new forgivable loan program [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=209.16s)]
*  for black entrepreneurs and the opportunity [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=211.28s)]
*  for multiple apprenticeships in the economy. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=213.48000000000002s)]
*  Similarly, Trump is trying to appeal directly [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=215.76s)]
*  to young male voters, especially those [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=218.56s)]
*  who are extremely online and might be more inclined [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=221.0s)]
*  to be independent or libertarian. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=224.28s)]
*  These are people who often don't turn out to vote. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=226.16s)]
*  He's targeting them by appearing on podcasts [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=228.56s)]
*  like Aidan Ross, The Nelt Boys. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=230.72s)]
*  This election might be the most important election [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=233.64s)]
*  in US history. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=236.0s)]
*  And Logan Paul. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  But what's particularly interesting [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=238.28s)]
*  is the thing he's not talking about on these podcasts, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=239.88s)]
*  policy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=242.84s)]
*  You ever been in a fist fight, Mr. President? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=243.84s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  I've been like little, just nothing like that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=249.28s)]
*  Nothing like that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=252.28s)]
*  I mean, I'd like to say, yeah, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=254.2s)]
*  I fought my way through school. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  And I went through, I fought my way [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=257.12s)]
*  out of the Wharton School of Finance. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=259.2s)]
*  I fought my way, but you know, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=260.8s)]
*  we didn't have a lot of fighters. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=262.32s)]
*  Trump may feel like talking differently to young men, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  talking the way you talk to friends [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=266.88s)]
*  when you're playing golf, when you're hanging out, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=268.2s)]
*  when you're just goofing around, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=269.88s)]
*  that that's the kind of connection [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=271.36s)]
*  that these voters will need [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=273.2s)]
*  to bring them to the polls in November. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=274.56s)]
*  Trump is also looking to appeal to Southern and rural men [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  who may be impacted by alcoholism and opioid abuse. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=279.96s)]
*  Trump spoke on Theo Vonn's this past weekend [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  about his older brother's battle with alcoholism [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=285.88s)]
*  and about Theo's recovery from addiction. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=288.68s)]
*  His name was Fred, Fred Trump. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=291.64000000000004s)]
*  And he had a problem with alcohol. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=294.20000000000005s)]
*  He got addicted to it because it's, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=297.48s)]
*  and you know, they say alcohol is tougher [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=299.56s)]
*  than drugs to get off of. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=302.04s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever heard that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=303.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'm in recovery, actually. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  I've been in, I've been in recovery [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=305.88s)]
*  so like most of the last 10 years. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  From alcohol? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=310.68s)]
*  From drugs and alcohol. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=311.68s)]
*  So which is worse? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=313.24s)]
*  For me, drugs is the problem. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=315.04s)]
*  The reason it's good talking about it [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=316.64s)]
*  is it might help other people. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=318.36s)]
*  If it helps one other person, it's worth the conversation. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=320.04s)]
*  A growing number of Americans [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=323.16s)]
*  have been impacted by addiction. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=324.44s)]
*  And Trump received praise for going on this program [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  and listening to Vonn and empathizing with his struggles. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=329.44s)]
*  This young male demographic [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=332.32s)]
*  is gonna be incredibly important for Trump. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=333.92s)]
*  He tends to be polling poorly with women, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=336.08s)]
*  so the more men he can turn out to vote, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=338.24s)]
*  that increases his chances of winning. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  As we get closer to election day, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  both Trump and Harris are gonna be doing [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=344.0s)]
*  everything they can to turn out the vote. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=345.92s)]
*  Current polling shows razor thin margins. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=348.12s)]
*  That means that every appearance they make, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=350.72s)]
*  every podcast they talk on, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=352.48s)]
*  that could be the difference between winning and losing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=354.36s)]
*  These podcasts could determine [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=357.20000000000005s)]
*  who is the next president of the United States. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qtiUH4Ets&t=359.12s)]
