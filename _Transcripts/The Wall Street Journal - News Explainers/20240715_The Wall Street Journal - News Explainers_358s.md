# Trump Shooting: How Violence Against Politicians Has Surged | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM)
*  Take a look at what happened. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=0.0s)]
*  The assassination attempt on Donald Trump is a shocking event. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=7.5s)]
*  Americans haven't seen anything like it since 1981, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=15.0s)]
*  when Ronald Reagan was the target of an assassination attempt. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=19.0s)]
*  He was wounded. My God. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=23.5s)]
*  He was...the president was hit. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=26.0s)]
*  But you don't need to reach back that far to see that America has had a large share of political violence. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=29.0s)]
*  We don't know the shooter's motive and whether he was driven by political hostility. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=37.0s)]
*  But many Americans are using this moment to pause [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=44.0s)]
*  and reflect on the trend of political violence that we have seen in America. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=47.0s)]
*  The string of violent attacks has been almost constant. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=53.0s)]
*  In 2017, someone who was angry at then-President Trump and at Republicans [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=57.0s)]
*  went to a baseball practice where Republican lawmakers were [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=63.0s)]
*  and shot a number of people, leaving a leading Republican lawmaker, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=67.0s)]
*  one of the senior members of the House, in critical condition. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=71.0s)]
*  This could have been a tragedy like so many others. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=74.0s)]
*  The next year, somebody sent pipe bombs to a number of critics of then-President Trump. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=77.0s)]
*  We heard the fire alarm go off while we were anchoring the show, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=83.0s)]
*  reporting on these explosive devices, facetious packages [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=86.0s)]
*  delivered to the former president's home of Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, George Soros, and the White House. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=90.0s)]
*  And minutes later, we were told suspicious packages, CNN, evacuate immediately. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=95.0s)]
*  In 2020, six men were arrested in a plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=100.0s)]
*  the Democratic governor of Michigan, and to try her for treason. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=105.0s)]
*  I think that the president has given safe harbor to hate organizations and terror, you know, domestic terror organizations. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=109.0s)]
*  USA! USA! [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=116.0s)]
*  And of course, one woman lost her life in the Capitol riot of January 6, 2021, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=119.0s)]
*  in which a crowd that had been stoked by President Trump [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=125.0s)]
*  tried to stop the certification of the vote and the results of the 2020 election. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=128.0s)]
*  We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=134.0s)]
*  In 2022, the husband of Nancy Yiaplosi, the former Democratic Speaker of the House, was attacked in his own home. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=139.0s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey, hey. What is going on here? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=147.0s)]
*  I'm not getting any answer on this. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=149.0s)]
*  And that same year, a man was arrested outside the home of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court Justice, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=151.0s)]
*  and he was found with a pistol and other threatening items in his backpack. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=157.0s)]
*  These incidents raise the question of why are they happening? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=161.0s)]
*  Is it simply a matter that public officials are in the public eye? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=164.0s)]
*  Or is there something in our political culture and in our culture more broadly that's driving these events? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=168.0s)]
*  One thing that will certainly turn to is whether the rise in political polarization is part of the problem. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=174.0s)]
*  There is no doubt that members of one party feel more animosity, not just dislike, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=181.0s)]
*  but significant dislike for members of the other party than they have in the past. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=187.0s)]
*  Polling has documented amply that members of one party feel that the other party's agenda, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=193.0s)]
*  if enacted, would not only be bad for America but would destroy America. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=199.0s)]
*  Polling has also shown that members of one party feel in very large numbers that those in the other party are immoral and close-minded. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=204.0s)]
*  Many people think that this hostility has been a kind of kindling that incites acts of violence or spurs them on, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=213.0s)]
*  though we don't know if this is the case in the attack on Donald Trump. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=219.0s)]
*  Some violence against political figures has been carried out by people with non-political motives, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=223.0s)]
*  people who just had access to guns and some kind of motivation to act. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=228.0s)]
*  The attack on Ronald Reagan was not politically motivated, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=233.0s)]
*  but rather done by someone who was trying to seek the attention of a celebrity. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=237.0s)]
*  But in many of these cases, the perpetrators did show some animosity toward one party or the other. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=241.0s)]
*  Some political violence has really changed the course of this country. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=247.0s)]
*  Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=250.0s)]
*  The death of Martin Luther King Jr., a horrible event, sparked violence and riots across the country. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=255.0s)]
*  Ronald Reagan's near-assassination became part of the mythology of him being a fighter and a survivor. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=262.0s)]
*  It will take time to learn what effect this assassination attempt means for the presidential election and for the two political parties. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=269.0s)]
*  Many Democrats say that Donald Trump himself has added a kind of negative energy to the political environment. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=277.0s)]
*  Trump's biggest lie of all is he had nothing to do with the insurrection of January 6. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=284.0s)]
*  We all saw with our own eyes. We saw we sent thousands to attack the Capitol. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=290.0s)]
*  Some Republicans right now are faulting Democratic rhetoric for fomenting the attempted assassination on President Trump. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=295.0s)]
*  When the message goes out constantly that the election of Donald Trump would be a threat to democracy and that the republic would end, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=302.0s)]
*  I mean, it heats up the environment. We cannot do that. It's simply not true. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=310.0s)]
*  Many Americans will be looking again at Donald Trump in the coming week. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=314.0s)]
*  As he goes to Milwaukee, he names his choice as a vice presidential running mate, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=318.0s)]
*  and he formally accepts his party's nomination for president. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=323.0s)]
*  Will he be perceived as a fighter and a hero to his supporters? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=327.0s)]
*  Or will Americans take a step back and say, gee, the political environment that he's part of is too heated and we want a calmer temperature? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=332.0s)]
*  But now more Americans are tuning in, and this is the moment where they'll be forming an opinion about who to vote for in November. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=342.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGS_S9UhWM&t=353.0s)]
