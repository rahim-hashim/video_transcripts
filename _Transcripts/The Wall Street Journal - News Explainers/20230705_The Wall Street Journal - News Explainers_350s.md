# Buy Now, Pay Later Apps vs. Credit Cards: The Pros and Cons | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY)
*  If you want to buy this pair of Adidas, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=0.0s)]
*  you can use your credit card or a Buy Now Pay Later service. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  The result seems similar. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=6.96s)]
*  You don't pay upfront, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  but with BNPL, you can break that full payment out into installments. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=10.96s)]
*  Usually with no interest, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Buy Now Pay Later firms have boomed over the last three years, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  and companies like PayPal, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=20.56s)]
*  Apple, and credit cards themselves are joining in on the hype. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=22.28s)]
*  But as some of the companies scale up with their growing customer base, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=26.68s)]
*  they're struggling to turn a profit. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=30.52s)]
*  Here's how Buy Now Pay Later services compare to credit cards, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=32.68s)]
*  and what it means for the next time you're checking out. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=36.44s)]
*  Everything today is pay-as-you-go. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=39.64s)]
*  Dan Delev is an analyst who follows companies like Affirm, Block, and PayPal. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=41.16s)]
*  Credit is becoming a pay-as-you-go thing, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=46.28s)]
*  especially in very young millennial demographics. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  Buy Now Pay Later companies took off in the U.S. during the pandemic. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=51.84s)]
*  Affirm, the only BNPL-focused company that's public in the U.S., [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=55.76s)]
*  reported its revenue more than doubled over the last two years. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=60.48s)]
*  One of the main ways these companies make money is through merchant discount rates, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=64.24s)]
*  a fee the retailer pays to the company on each Buy Now Pay Later purchase. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=68.64s)]
*  Selling is better than not selling, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=72.88s)]
*  and merchants are willing to accept somewhat of a discount in order to make the sale. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=74.52s)]
*  The number of retailers signed on to use Affirm [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=78.72s)]
*  jumped from just 6,000 in 2020 to 235,000 in 2022. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=81.48s)]
*  Part of the reason for its popularity is that Buy Now Pay Later is more accessible than a credit card. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=87.72s)]
*  BNPL is very attractive to people who have credit difficulties. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  Todd Baker is a lecturer at Columbia Law School, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=97.04s)]
*  who has worked as an executive in finance and teaches about emerging fintech. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  Other people do it just because it seems like a good idea. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=104.4s)]
*  Let's go back to that cart with our Adidas. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=108.76s)]
*  With a credit card, you need approval to use that credit, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  often well before you put your shoes in the cart. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=114.44s)]
*  Companies like Affirm, Clarna, and Afterpay, on the other hand, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=117.2s)]
*  can approve on the spot and make approvals purchase by purchase. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=120.92s)]
*  That's because of the different ways they check your credit. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=125.16000000000001s)]
*  Credit card companies do a deep dive into your credit history that shows up on your credit score. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=127.76s)]
*  Buy Now Pay Later companies typically perform a less formal credit check [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=132.96s)]
*  and look at additional data, like previous times you've used their service. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=137.2s)]
*  BNPL can give more spending power to people who may not have access to credit or have credit built up. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=141.48s)]
*  But that can be an issue. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=147.2s)]
*  There is a risk that credit will be extended to you in a situation where you're not likely to be able to repay. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=148.68s)]
*  And that's not good either for the issuer of the credit or for the consumer. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=154.56s)]
*  Affirm's CEO, Max Leppchen, says the company accounts for this. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  We do have to say no and tell our consumers with love and compassion, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=163.52s)]
*  you're overextending yourself, please don't buy this. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=166.8s)]
*  Clarna says it also takes measures to make sure it only extends loans to borrowers who can repay. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  Both Clarna and Afterpay restrict use of their services if a borrower misses a payment. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=174.44s)]
*  Buy Now Pay Later lacks some of the regulated safeguards that credit cards have for consumers in the U.S. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  That's in part because they're not covered by the Truth in Lending Act. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=185.36s)]
*  This is a law that requires that lenders provide you all of your loan information upfront. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=189.16s)]
*  No hidden costs. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  It applies to loans that are paid for in more than four installments. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=195.68s)]
*  Buy Now Pay Later falls just below that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=199.52s)]
*  The product was structured essentially to avoid the application of the Truth in Lending Act. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=202.08s)]
*  The beauty of BNPL for the retailer is that it's instantaneous. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=207.44s)]
*  And the provision of significant disclosure before a particular transaction would be very difficult. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=211.96s)]
*  A firm says it provides a Truth in Lending disclosure for all credit extensions. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=216.84s)]
*  And Clarna says it supports additional regulation of the sector. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=221.32000000000002s)]
*  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also warns that consumers could risk overextension, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=225.08s)]
*  meaning they have more debt than they can handle. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=230.72s)]
*  This could happen because they could borrow from multiple lenders at once, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=233.12s)]
*  since BNPL platforms can't see borrowing activity on other platforms. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=237.16000000000003s)]
*  Customer defaults, when they happen, can have an impact on companies' costs. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=241.88000000000002s)]
*  So they have to balance the risk of delinquencies with approving enough transactions to cover their costs. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=246.52s)]
*  That's the key to a successful Buy Now Pay Later. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=252.24s)]
*  It's underwriting, underwriting, underwriting. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=254.88s)]
*  Clarna said that its underwriting practices have helped keep its default rates below 1%. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=258.24s)]
*  But delinquencies aren't the only thing that can undermine profits. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=263.68s)]
*  Shifting consumer habits can cut down on transactions. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=267.6s)]
*  And many Buy Now Pay Later programs rely on funding that is sensitive to interest rates. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=270.96000000000004s)]
*  Since merchant fees make up the bulk of their profit, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=276.44s)]
*  companies might have to raise them to make up for higher borrowing costs. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=279.23999999999995s)]
*  If interest rates go up a lot, then they're in trouble because the cost of money is going to be too high [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=283.32s)]
*  to more than offset with the merchant discount rate. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=288.76s)]
*  Affirm and Clarna offer services beyond BNPL and are continuing to diversify their offerings. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=292.2s)]
*  But they're also facing increasing competition from Apple, PayPal and credit card installment plans. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=298.76s)]
*  Still, for some Buy Now Pay Later CEOs, like Affirm's Levchin, the competition is clear. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=304.76s)]
*  The enemy or the competitor is the credit cards, not each other. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=310.24s)]
*  Despite these challenges, DeLev thinks that Buy Now Pay Later is here to stay. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=313.2s)]
*  And as they become bigger and offer more services, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=317.76s)]
*  they will be able to gain scale and increase profitability. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=321.0s)]
*  But some Buy Now Pay Later firms, like Afterpay, have been bought by larger companies. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=324.28s)]
*  The fundamental question has always been, is BNPL a business or is it just a product [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=329.24s)]
*  for other providers of financial services? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=334.12s)]
*  And I think the consensus seems to be shifting towards the idea that BNPL, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  as a standalone business, is not likely to be successful in the competitive market. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spgZe-XwMeY&t=342.0s)]
