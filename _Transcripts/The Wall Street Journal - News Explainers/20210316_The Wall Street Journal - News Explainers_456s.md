# Why Boeing’s Starliner Test Launch Is Mission Critical | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 16, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk)
*  One, and lift off the rise of Starliner and a new era in human spaceflight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=0.0s)]
*  In 2019, Boeing and NASA attempted to send an uncrewed spacecraft to the International [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=8.1s)]
*  Space Station, but the test flight failed to reach the correct orbit. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=13.08s)]
*  It was just one in a series of issues the company's space program has faced in recent [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=17.3s)]
*  years. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Now, as Boeing gears up to launch Starliner again, all eyes are on the company. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  If it succeeds, the test flight could renew investor and customer confidence in Boeing's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=28.46s)]
*  space program. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=33.22s)]
*  But if it fails, it could put a dent in the already weakened Aerospace Company. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=34.46s)]
*  So it's a big challenge with very high stakes and a lot of national and corporate pride [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=39.18s)]
*  at stake and a lot of money at stake. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=45.58s)]
*  Here's how Boeing, which was once the gold standard of the stars, got to this point. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=47.94s)]
*  For decades, Boeing was at the cutting edge of the space industry. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=54.02s)]
*  They've been involved in every major NASA development. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=57.82s)]
*  This is Steven Gnote, a space industry veteran who's consulted in the industry for 15 years. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=61.34s)]
*  They built critical communication satellites for NASA and for others in the commercial [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=67.02s)]
*  and the national security industry. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=72.12s)]
*  In 2014, Boeing was awarded a NASA contract worth as much as $4.2 billion. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=74.62s)]
*  But just four years later, an external audit found that the world's largest aerospace [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=80.8s)]
*  company was struggling. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=85.18s)]
*  In October 2018, at the direction of Congress, NASA released an audit of its Space Launch [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=87.14s)]
*  System, also known as the SLS. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=92.94s)]
*  This deep space explorer is the most powerful rocket NASA has ever developed and is one [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=95.62s)]
*  of the agency's largest contracts with Boeing. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=100.36s)]
*  NASA's audit found that the project was years behind schedule and billions of dollars [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=102.94s)]
*  over budget due in part to management, technical and infrastructure issues driven by Boeing's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=107.62s)]
*  poor performance. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=113.82s)]
*  What the auditor's report did was surface to the space division some of the engineering [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=114.94s)]
*  challenges that seem to have seeped throughout the company, both its broader defense and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=120.46s)]
*  commercial jetliner business. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=125.86s)]
*  Doug Cameron has covered Boeing and the larger aerospace and defense industry for over 30 [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=128.1s)]
*  years. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=133.14s)]
*  He explains that as the development of the Space Launch System continued, Boeing was [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=134.14s)]
*  juggling another high-profile contract with NASA as well. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=138.54s)]
*  The Commercial Crew Program, which aims to send astronauts and cargo to and from the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=142.14s)]
*  International Space Station inside of Boeing's Starliner crew capsule. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=146.61999999999998s)]
*  Boeing was the original prime contractor and integrator for the International Space Station, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=151.22s)]
*  so they helped design and implement that from inception and they still helped to operate [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=157.1s)]
*  the space station. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=161.26s)]
*  And being able to bring astronauts up on a Boeing capsule to the station is something [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=162.57999999999998s)]
*  that Boeing has set out as a major goal for its space program. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=167.33999999999997s)]
*  When Starliner launched in December 2019, it was a critical moment for Boeing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=173.14s)]
*  But just minutes into the test flight, NASA's controllers knew something had gone wrong. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=179.26s)]
*  So we did have obviously some challenges today. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=184.73999999999998s)]
*  When the spacecraft separated from the launch vehicle, we did not get the orbital insertion [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=188.73999999999998s)]
*  burn that we were hoping for. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=194.22s)]
*  The spacecraft's internal timer was off by 11 hours, stranding it in the wrong orbit, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=196.42s)]
*  which prevented it from being able to reach the International Space Station. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=201.78s)]
*  The failure in 2019 of the on-orbit test of Starliner was driven primarily due to faulty [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=206.18s)]
*  software and maybe more importantly, faulty software testing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=212.14s)]
*  Boeing chose to design tests in a way that were not truly representative or tied to the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=217.98s)]
*  actual vehicle itself. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=224.9s)]
*  And these mistakes were costly. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=227.5s)]
*  Boeing has taken a $410 million charge primarily to run a second test. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=229.5s)]
*  This is about 10% of the program's entire budget. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=234.1s)]
*  A Boeing spokesperson said that since the first test flight, the company has made important [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=237.42s)]
*  changes to the software code that are consistent with the recommendations of the Boeing-NASA [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=241.7s)]
*  independent review team. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=246.62s)]
*  So I think Boeing is invested in this both with its brand as a great and historic engineering [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=248.34s)]
*  company that has been serving NASA since its inception, but also financially because [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=256.02s)]
*  Boeing as we all know, overall is in much more difficult financial circumstances due [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=263.06s)]
*  to pandemic and problems with their commercial aircraft. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=268.09999999999997s)]
*  And that puts an even higher spotlight on the performance of Starliner. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=271.4s)]
*  Since Starliner's orbital failure in 2019, Boeing's space program has faced a series [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=276.85999999999996s)]
*  of additional challenges. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=282.53999999999996s)]
*  In 2020, federal prosecutors opened a criminal probe into whether a senior NASA official [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=284.34s)]
*  improperly told a Boeing executive about the status of a lunar lander contract, causing [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=289.32s)]
*  the company to change its bid. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=293.94s)]
*  Boeing ultimately lost the contract to competitors. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=296.38s)]
*  And in January 2021, the company faced another setback when the main engines for the space [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=299.34s)]
*  launch system shut down prematurely during a ground test. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=304.52s)]
*  These problems are to be expected. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=308.36s)]
*  That's why you do the testing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=310.14s)]
*  The problem for Boeing is it's the latest in a series of very high profile failures [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=311.46s)]
*  and obviously have customers and Boeing investors asking the question, you know, when will they [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=316.41999999999996s)]
*  get it right? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=321.62s)]
*  But despite years of issues and wavering faith from NASA, Boeing has seen successes in the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=323.12s)]
*  space industry as well. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=328.17999999999995s)]
*  It's a 50-50 partner in the United Launch Alliance, a company which has successfully [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=330.34s)]
*  launched over 140 consecutive missions, more than any other launch program in the world. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=335.17999999999995s)]
*  Boeing has also developed satellites, spacesuits, and other technology for NASA and continues [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=341.1s)]
*  to play a key role in the maintenance of the International Space Station. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=346.14000000000004s)]
*  For Boeing, the space program is a key part of the company. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=350.48s)]
*  It's part of its Defense, Space, and Security Unit, Boeing's largest by revenue, after [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=353.94s)]
*  a sharp drop in aircraft deliveries over the past two years. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=358.42s)]
*  With travel demand still weak due to the pandemic, experts say Boeing will likely continue to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=362.16s)]
*  rely on the unit. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=367.46000000000004s)]
*  This is one reason all eyes are on the company's next test launch of Starliner. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=369.58s)]
*  The spacecraft's second uncrewed flight was slated for March, but has been pushed back [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=374.09999999999997s)]
*  due to scheduling and repair delays. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=378.7s)]
*  For Boeing, the pressure is on. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=381.02s)]
*  The company is already far behind competitor SpaceX, which has successfully launched astronauts [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=382.76s)]
*  to the ISS as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=387.82s)]
*  The entire industry will be looking at Boeing, who's already named astronauts that it would [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=391.7s)]
*  like to fly. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=395.46s)]
*  Astronauts are ready and waiting to go up on a Boeing vehicle, but Boeing needs to make [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=396.46s)]
*  sure that vehicle is safe. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=401.53999999999996s)]
*  It needs to make sure that not only all of the mechanical and normal challenges are addressed, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=403.26s)]
*  but all of the software and the software testing and oversight challenges have been addressed [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=408.38s)]
*  and have been managed by the company. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=413.06s)]
*  If the launch is a success, astronauts could be flying to the International Space Station [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=415.09999999999997s)]
*  inside Boeing's Starliner later this year. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=419.79999999999995s)]
*  This would be a big win for Boeing at large. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=422.82s)]
*  The company's CEO, David Calhoun, said that Boeing was proud of all the products and services [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=425.34s)]
*  our engineers have developed and delivered to our commercial and military customers over [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=430.38s)]
*  these last difficult years and of the meaningful progress we are making in safety, transparency [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=434.53999999999996s)]
*  and quality. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=439.65999999999997s)]
*  The success or failure of Starliner will help determine the future of Boeing and its role [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=440.97999999999996s)]
*  in the exploration and commercialization of outer space. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PFN2on8lk&t=445.91999999999996s)]
