# How Energy Got So Cheap | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc)
*  The price of virtually every form of energy is hitting new lows in 2020. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=0.0s)]
*  Oil prices are still depressed after a historic crash in spring. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=4.92s)]
*  Natural gas hit a 25-year low this summer. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=9.92s)]
*  And prices for coal continue their descent. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=12.92s)]
*  Even the cost of generating renewable energy has fallen so sharply that it's becoming competitive with fossil fuels. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=15.92s)]
*  The rock bottom energy prices are bad for drillers and other producers. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=22.92s)]
*  But they're great for consumers who have to fill their tanks and power their homes. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=28.12s)]
*  And they're a boost for businesses that consume a lot of energy, like manufacturers and utilities. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  But some experts say this price route across the energy sector isn't built to last. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  Here's how energy got so cheap. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  The main thing pushing down prices is a huge glut of natural gas. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Production skyrocketed in the U.S. over the last decade and a half as shale drillers unearthed troves of the fuel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  We started to build U.S. gas supply just ahead of the Great Recession, anticipating a real kind of exponential growth in energy demand globally. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=57.32s)]
*  And we built capacity toward a demand peak that really never materialized. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=69.32s)]
*  The rise in production swamped the market, pushing down prices, even as the U.S. burned more natural gas than ever in 2019. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=75.32s)]
*  Then the coronavirus shut down businesses around the globe. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=83.12s)]
*  As Americans hunkered down, demand for electricity plunged. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=86.72s)]
*  Economists estimate that roughly half of the American workforce is now working from home. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=90.72s)]
*  With workers gone, office buildings and factories turned off the lights and the air conditioning. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=95.72s)]
*  Back in April, when COVID containment measures were at their peak, overall power demand was down 10 percent. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=101.72s)]
*  As demand sunk, U.S. gas producers were slow to respond and dial back output, which added to the glut, driving down wholesale prices even further. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=110.72s)]
*  Cheap natural gas, which is the biggest source of electricity in the United States, has met lower power prices. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=118.72s)]
*  Here's a look at prices in 2020 versus past years. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=124.72s)]
*  In New York City, prices were down by about half compared to the five-year average. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=128.72s)]
*  As gas prices bottomed out, a similar dynamic was playing out in oil. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=134.72s)]
*  This spring, crude prices took an unprecedented turn, with futures contracts trading in negative territory for the first time ever. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=138.72s)]
*  We think of it more, not so much as a perfect storm, but rather death by a thousand cuts for these oil producers. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=145.72s)]
*  So, over the years, U.S. production grew. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=153.72s)]
*  To some extent, global demand didn't quite reach the expectations on which producers hinged their production plans. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=157.72s)]
*  We just ended up with more oil in the market than we knew what to do with. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=166.72s)]
*  And then COVID was really kind of the last shoe to drop and kind of cut things in a way that we've certainly never seen before in the industry. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=171.72s)]
*  We simply ran out of space to put the oil. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=181.72s)]
*  Within a few weeks, prices bounced back, but are still low enough to bankrupt oil companies. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=184.72s)]
*  This pushed down gasoline prices across the country. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=189.72s)]
*  In some regions, prices dropped below a dollar a gallon. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=192.72s)]
*  Though fewer people are driving and flying, those who are are reaping the benefits. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=196.72s)]
*  Here's the retail price of gasoline in the United States. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=201.72s)]
*  You can see, at its lowest point, the average price was $1.77, down from $2.78 in July 2019. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=205.72s)]
*  The cost to install new renewable energy projects is plunging too. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=213.72s)]
*  The long-held theory is that low fossil fuel prices would hamper the development of renewable energy projects. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=218.72s)]
*  But that's not how it's playing out. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=224.72s)]
*  Renewable energy has gotten cheaper, presenting power buyers with options. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=226.72s)]
*  Certainly in the United States, previously a lot of renewable energy deployment was driven by state mandates. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=231.72s)]
*  And now, because the price of energy for these technologies has dropped so rapidly, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=238.72s)]
*  many utilities and energy purchases are choosing to buy wind and solar for purely economic reasons. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=243.72s)]
*  This chart shows the levelized price of different types of energy, which accounts for production costs. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=251.72s)]
*  The levelized cost of energy is trying to capture the total lifetime costs of an energy asset. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=256.72s)]
*  So it captures upright costs, operating costs, and benefits associated with that system. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=264.72s)]
*  You can see that prices for new renewable projects have fallen over the last decade, in some cases sharply. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=271.72s)]
*  That's in part thanks to a decade of low interest rates, which helped fuel the shale drilling boom and made renewable energy projects cheaper too. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=278.72s)]
*  But it's also due to advances in technology. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=285.72s)]
*  Scaling up that supply chain can really reduce costs. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=288.72s)]
*  Declining costs to produce renewable energy have resulted in growing supplies of green power around the world, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=292.72s)]
*  pushing down prices and encouraging consumption. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=298.72s)]
*  In the US, more electricity was consumed last year with renewable sources than with coal for the first time in more than 130 years. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=301.72s)]
*  So what do these trends mean for consumers? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=309.72s)]
*  The lower prices aren't always evident on your monthly bill due to taxes and other factors, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=312.72s)]
*  but the real cost of electricity to consumers and businesses has declined slightly over the last decade. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=318.72s)]
*  Analysts expect at the end of the day in the long term for electricity prices to go down. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=324.72s)]
*  Some of it is based off of technology improvements, the lower cost of wind and solar, but some of it is also regulatory. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=330.72s)]
*  In the short term, however, experts say prices could rise. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=338.72s)]
*  Producers turned off the spigots in hopes of reducing the glut. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=342.72s)]
*  And now, demand for natural gas is picking back up. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=345.72s)]
*  So those two trends don't work together. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=348.72s)]
*  Growing demand on one side encouraged by the low prices and declining supply with producers who simply can't make things work with the gas prices where they are. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=351.72s)]
*  So we think by the winter you're going to see a much stronger gas price come through. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=359.72s)]
*  We think we're at a point where gas prices are unsustainably low, such that they have to rise. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=365.72s)]
*  What is certain is that 2020 is shaping up to be a historic year of abundant, cheaply produced energy. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wNUaFOkJc&t=371.72s)]
