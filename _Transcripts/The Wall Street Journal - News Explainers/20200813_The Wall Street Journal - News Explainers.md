# This 30-Ton Robot Could Help Scientists Produce the Crops of the Future  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 13, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY)
*  It's this huge robot that just goes along rails and takes pictures of plants. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=0.0s)]
*  I call it the plant robot. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=7.08s)]
*  And inevitably the next question that they always ask is, why? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Why do you take pictures of plants? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=14.44s)]
*  Arizona is described by some as having the climate of tomorrow today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=17.92s)]
*  If we think about corn, if you want to see how it responds to drought, you need to bring [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=22.36s)]
*  it to an area like this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=26.26s)]
*  You know, they don't build Volkswagen's in Maricopa, Arizona, but they bring them here [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=27.84s)]
*  to test because it is so extreme. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  The crops growing here can do so in upwards of 115 degree heat, often with limited water. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  So as the world's climate changes, how will farmers grow the crops of the future? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=40.44s)]
*  These scientists want to figure that out. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=45.32s)]
*  Thinking about the future, we need to start planning for it now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=47.92s)]
*  Because if we don't, we're going to arrive at a situation in 50 years where we're not [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=51.2s)]
*  equipped to deal with it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=54.88s)]
*  Basically, it'll change the way we live. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=56.96s)]
*  Does it get harder to like fill them up? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=65.12s)]
*  I'm assuming when they go deeper in at that point? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=67.12s)]
*  According to researchers, this is the largest agricultural robot in the world. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=70.88s)]
*  It's collecting data from crops here in Maricopa as part of a collaborative effort between [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=75.68s)]
*  research institutions to better understand plant genetics and plant responses to the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=79.52s)]
*  environment. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=83.72s)]
*  A team of scientists and engineers from the University of Arizona manage the day-to-day [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=85.12s)]
*  operations of the field scanalyzer and help process the data it collects. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=89.12s)]
*  The project has been running since 2016, with funding from the Department of Energy and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=93.84s)]
*  the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=98.32s)]
*  The project aims to help produce stress-resilient crops, ones that could thrive in warmer and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=100.4s)]
*  drier climates, or help produce biofuels to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=105.0s)]
*  Specifically, like these ones, you know, we're getting some extensive seeding damage. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=109.2s)]
*  The climate models predict that, you know, 100 years' surface temperature will be increased [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  by 5 degrees centigrade. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=116.2s)]
*  That's a lot different than what we have now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=118.72s)]
*  And we aren't going to be able to develop plants fast enough to meet that change in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  the environment. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=125.84s)]
*  Scientists are still trying to figure out how likely that is. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  But Pauli and his team are hoping to produce plants that can withstand the warmer temperatures [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=131.16s)]
*  forecast by several climate models. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=135.16s)]
*  The long-term goal is understanding, you know, how we're going to address this problem of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=137.96s)]
*  understanding drought resiliency. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  You'll notice it has this large bank of LED lights. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=147.4s)]
*  How this camera operates is it basically sends out a saturating pulse of light that quenches [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=150.12s)]
*  all the photo systems within the plants, and then we take a series of about 100 images [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  in about two seconds. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=159.68s)]
*  The 30-ton scanner, referred to by the team as the Gantry, uses sensors and cameras to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=161.68s)]
*  capture detailed images of the width, length, shape, and angle of individual plant leaves. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=166.5s)]
*  A single scan can generate more than 15,000 individual photos. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=172.62s)]
*  The information we can gain from the Gantry is we can try to see, like, which of these [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=177.66s)]
*  varieties behind me is most efficient with sunlight? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=182.14s)]
*  Which one's best at taking that, like, you know, natural energy and converting it into [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=185.3s)]
*  biomass? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=188.94s)]
*  That's what we really want. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=190.3s)]
*  We want to identify those plants that can do that with the least amount of water possible. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=191.3s)]
*  And so those are the types of, like, transformative insights that we're really looking for in [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=195.46s)]
*  terms of addressing some of these larger problems. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=200.34s)]
*  Paul hopes that the data collected from the Gantry will be transferable, not just to other [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=202.86s)]
*  crops but to other localities. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=207.02s)]
*  The technology driving this project is really not anything special, but it's more about, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=209.70000000000002s)]
*  like, the integration of all these various different components. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=213.34s)]
*  What I hope it'll enable? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  Sustainable farming, sustainable production of nutritious calories for people. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=219.38s)]
*  I mean, that's the goal of this whole project is, you know, improving the human condition. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=223.34s)]
*  Another crucial part of the project happens two hours away in Tucson. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=229.22s)]
*  Eric Lyons leads a team of students who grapple with the thousands of images that come off [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=234.74s)]
*  the Gantry on a daily basis, creating up to 10 terabytes of data per day. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=238.78s)]
*  Once we have those coordinates, we can then go back to our 3D images and say, OK, I want [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=243.66s)]
*  a crop of this specific area. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=249.06s)]
*  And that's what you're seeing here. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=251.74s)]
*  One of the key challenges, especially with data coming off the Gantry system, is we're [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=254.62s)]
*  dealing with sensor data from about half a dozen different cameras, as well as a bunch [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=259.34s)]
*  of environmental sensors. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=265.16s)]
*  So we take all of these data in, all coming from different cameras, all requiring different [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=266.9s)]
*  kinds of data processing. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=271.7s)]
*  Part of that processing involves machine learning. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=274.02s)]
*  Lyons' team is dealing with thousands of images on a daily basis. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=277.06s)]
*  Machine learning algorithms help them stitch these photos together, as well as identify [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=280.82s)]
*  individual plants and track their progress over time. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=284.5s)]
*  Ideally, we'd love to have predictive models. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=288.34s)]
*  Often these are going to be based on machine learning methods in order to say, before we [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=292.22s)]
*  plant a plant, how is this going to perform given some scenario over its growing season? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=296.02s)]
*  How will it perform in a storm? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=303.26s)]
*  How will it perform in a drought? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=304.88s)]
*  How will it perform with excessive heat days? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=307.0s)]
*  How will it perform if it's particularly cold and damp? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=309.76s)]
*  While algorithms are making the job of processing this data easier, the project still requires [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=313.28s)]
*  a human touch. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=318.12s)]
*  Emmanuel Gonzalez is a grad student at the University of Arizona. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=320.28s)]
*  He splits his time between the computational side of the project in Tucson and working with [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=324.04s)]
*  the crops in Maricopa. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=328.52s)]
*  It's really important to have an exposure to both. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=330.44s)]
*  There's the whole computational aspect, but there's also spending time with the plants. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=333.46s)]
*  There's a sense of other information that you get just from being here. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=338.28s)]
*  The smaller details, such as how close are the plants, how do they feel? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=342.26s)]
*  My hope is that as a breeder in the future, I can collect data that can inform growers [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=348.24s)]
*  into growing their crops more sustainably. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=354.36s)]
*  What that would hopefully translate into is also making this technology available widespread. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=357.72s)]
*  Not just to farmers here in the United States, but also casting a wider net throughout the world. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=364.3s)]
*  My family grew up in Mexico, and we have very similar weather. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=371.44s)]
*  I don't really like to focus in on one thing. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=375.72s)]
*  I always like to see things from a global perspective. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=378.24s)]
*  This is 30 days out from flowering. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=382.16s)]
*  Currently right now our biggest risk is ensuring that the plants actually flower. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=385.8s)]
*  So any type of damage just begins to accumulate. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=391.2s)]
*  It's still early days, but the team here hope that this data could help the farmers of the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=395.44s)]
*  future grow successful crops in what could be increasingly challenging conditions. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=399.68s)]
*  If we do our job well, the gantry will be obsolete. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=404.48s)]
*  And I say that not from anything jaded, it's just the fact that we've been able to take [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=407.08000000000004s)]
*  the technology, the instrumentation, we've been able to make it small. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=412.2s)]
*  Democratization basically. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=417.71999999999997s)]
*  How do we take some of the cameras on board, make them small, and put them in the pockets [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=419.84s)]
*  of subsistence farmers, or any farmer really, to basically improve crop production? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=423.8s)]
*  I think in the future farmers are going to rely increasingly more on technology. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=429.24s)]
*  At the moment they already do. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=435.76s)]
*  There are sensors that they mount on tractors and they have subscriptions to a variety of [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=437.72s)]
*  different geospatial technology out there. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=442.8s)]
*  And that's just going to increase. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=445.48s)]
*  I think the farmer of the future is going to not only be able to know how to manage [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=447.52000000000004s)]
*  a field and work the plant, but also be able to wrangle the technology and be able to make [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=452.92s)]
*  informed decisions from that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2gKRdMeXY&t=459.8s)]
