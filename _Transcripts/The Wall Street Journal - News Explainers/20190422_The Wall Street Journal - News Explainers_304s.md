# Why Midwest Flooding Is Particularly Bad This Spring | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 22, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM)
*  2019 is shaping up to be a year of historic flooding in several parts of the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=0.0s)]
*  Early flooding in March impacted several communities along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=8.36s)]
*  This region features 59% of the nation's corn-producing farmland, which produces roughly [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=13.72s)]
*  67% of the nation's corn output. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=18.72s)]
*  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency expects flooding to continue through May. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  NOAA's Spring 2019 outlook identified the major reasons for this year's historic flooding. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=27.6s)]
*  So let's run through four of the big ones. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=32.92s)]
*  Okay, breaking news, more rain means more flooding. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=35.6s)]
*  As the weather warms up heading into April, the atmosphere retains more moisture, which [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=40.28s)]
*  leads to more rain. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=44.8s)]
*  We've had an abnormal year when it comes to precipitation through the winter months. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  This past winter season, we saw it to 200% of normal as far as precipitation. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=53.4s)]
*  So we've got a lot of snow water equivalent sitting on the ground. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  Snow water equivalent is the amount of leftover water if an entire unit of snow were to melt. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=63.68s)]
*  Reason number two, excess amounts of snow. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=69.08s)]
*  In late winter, several portions of the Midwest experienced something called abomogenesis. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=71.98s)]
*  You get this storm system and it was like abomogenesis that came through, jumped out [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=77.24s)]
*  into the plains. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=83.24s)]
*  It produced hurricane force winds across the central part of the country. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=84.72s)]
*  So you had the battle of the warm air and the cold air. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=88.0s)]
*  You had that warm air was affecting up. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  It was melting that snow that was ready to release. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=93.96s)]
*  On the backside of it, you had snow and those still hurricane force winds and turned into [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=97.02s)]
*  blizzard conditions. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  That weather pattern of extreme cold followed by relatively extreme heat further exacerbated [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  flooding. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=111.8s)]
*  Reason number three, frozen ground and fully saturated soils. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=114.16s)]
*  That extreme cold caused another problem. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=118.92s)]
*  The topsoil froze, which made the ground less permeable, like concrete. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=121.6s)]
*  Water that would usually absorb into the dirt had nowhere else to go. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=126.5s)]
*  This is the same concept that makes cities with vast networks of roads more susceptible [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=130.4s)]
*  to flooding. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=134.32s)]
*  We had this, you know, a lot of precipitation in the form of rain prior to it freezing. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=135.44s)]
*  So I mean, that ground is saturated to a certain level. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=141.6s)]
*  The freeze depth will grow just like that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  We see the ice on the river systems. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=148.04s)]
*  And what happens when that ground actually freezes, it becomes a hard surface. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=150.44s)]
*  So any rain that falls on it, it just shoots it right off. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=156.66s)]
*  Rain on top of snow, on top of frozen ground. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=161.0s)]
*  And it's just the perfect combination for a flooding event. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=163.64s)]
*  The soil along the Missouri River, a significant hotspot of flooding this year, doesn't irrigate [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=168.52s)]
*  easily. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=173.24s)]
*  The weather across the Midwest also led to excessive ice deposits. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=174.24s)]
*  These large chunks of ice can eventually jam up the free flow of water downriver, like [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=179.24s)]
*  a natural dam. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=183.82000000000002s)]
*  When the river is jammed, floodwaters can temporarily overspill even further onto farms [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  or other property. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=190.28s)]
*  Some farmers were left waiting for days or even weeks for floodwaters to recede from [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=192.60000000000002s)]
*  their property. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=196.32s)]
*  So what's the impact? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=198.88s)]
*  For farming communities along the Missouri River, think Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=200.78s)]
*  the impact is substantial. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=205.76s)]
*  The flooding comes at the beginning of planting season for many of the farmers in the region. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=207.78s)]
*  And some farmers are still waiting to survey the damage done as floodwaters recede. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=212.56s)]
*  These delays will carry big implications for the entire agribusiness supply chain. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=217.68s)]
*  Water has contaminated some of what was in farmers' grain bins, which could mean some [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=223.48s)]
*  fairly substantial losses for farmers. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=229.6s)]
*  Delays in the beginning of planting season also may prompt farmers to plant soybeans [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  rather than corn because soybeans can be planted later. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=237.88s)]
*  Also transportation networks are running slower due to the flooding. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=242.2s)]
*  That may impede the agribusiness supply chain as shipments stall while floodwaters recede [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  from obstructed roads or rail lines. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=250.2s)]
*  Compared to this time last year, there were 14% less grain carloads in transport. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=253.24s)]
*  Grain barge movements were also down about 31% compared to this time last year. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=258.6s)]
*  The impact of the slowdown is already weighing on grain traders. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=263.8s)]
*  One company told the Journal that flooding would cut its first quarter operating profit [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=267.0s)]
*  by up to $60 million. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=270.64s)]
*  The slowdowns are even reaching into the energy sector as the supply of corn slows down. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=273.44s)]
*  Gasoline prices are up 7% compared to the same time last year. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=278.56s)]
*  The National Weather Service cautiously notes that the worst of flood season may be in the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=282.74s)]
*  rearview mirror. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=287.14s)]
*  I hate to say this, we might have seen the worst by now. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=288.14s)]
*  But the impact of the flooding from early March will be felt for months to come. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4-tzHSgdM&t=293.1s)]
