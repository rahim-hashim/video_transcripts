# How Tesla Became the Most Valuable Auto Maker in the World | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 04, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog)
*  I don't think any other stock has captivated investors on Wall Street or Main Street the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=0.0s)]
*  way Tesla has. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=7.62s)]
*  It's just become one of the most controversial names and one of the most watched names out [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=8.98s)]
*  there. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=14.14s)]
*  This summer, Tesla became the most valuable auto company in the world, surpassing Toyota [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=15.14s)]
*  and claiming a market cap of over $190 billion before continuing its climb. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=20.72s)]
*  The electric vehicle maker stocks speeding this year. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=26.26s)]
*  Its wealth skyrocketing thanks to a surge in Tesla shares, making him wealthier than [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=29.2s)]
*  Warren Buffett. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=34.2s)]
*  But the company's fundamentals don't seem to explain the rise. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=35.56s)]
*  For example, Toyota sold almost 25 times as many vehicles as Tesla did last year. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=39.2s)]
*  Instead, the rally has been driven by investor enthusiasm for CEO Elon Musk, in a belief [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=45.12s)]
*  by some that in the future, cars everywhere will be powered by batteries, not gasoline. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=50.96s)]
*  Here's how Tesla became the most valuable automaker in the world. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=56.72s)]
*  Tesla developed its first car in the early 2000s, but to follow its ballooning share [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=62.76s)]
*  price, a good place to start is last fall. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=67.2s)]
*  In October 2019, Tesla reported a surprise profit for its latest quarter, and that just [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=69.96s)]
*  sent its shares soaring. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=76.48s)]
*  Just a few months prior, Tesla shares were hovering near a three-year low. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=78.8s)]
*  In the prior year, Elon Musk had tweeted that he was going to take Tesla private at [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=84.56s)]
*  $420 a share, and that landed him in the crosshairs of regulators. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=89.7s)]
*  He also kind of had a history of missing financial targets and car delivery targets. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=94.88s)]
*  So that's why this surprise earnings beat was a really big deal. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=99.56s)]
*  Amid the rush of investor optimism, in mid-November, Musk held an event in Los Angeles to reveal [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=103.36s)]
*  Tesla's Cybertruck. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=109.08s)]
*  What he did was he unveiled this pickup truck that looked unlike any other pickup truck [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=111.08s)]
*  we had ever seen before. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=116.48s)]
*  And he boasted that it was really, really durable. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=118.0s)]
*  At the event, a Tesla employee threw a metal ball at the window to show its strength, but [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=121.92s)]
*  ended up breaking the glass. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=126.96s)]
*  Oh, I should say also, we're going to be offering rides in this all night. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=127.96s)]
*  Yeah, don't mind the glass. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=132.8s)]
*  The next day, shares fell more than 6 percent. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=140.08s)]
*  But amid press around the event, the stock quickly recovered, and on December 23rd, it [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  surged past $420. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=148.12s)]
*  The reason that 420 mark is kind of a milestone is that, you know, that was kind of the tweet [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=151.4s)]
*  that landed Musk in the crosshairs of regulators. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=156.88000000000002s)]
*  The SEC later said the tweet was a reference to marijuana culture that Musk used to amuse [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=159.88000000000002s)]
*  his girlfriend. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=164.24s)]
*  The shares crossing 420 later in the year, it was kind of a victory in that sense. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=165.3s)]
*  In the following weeks, Tesla had a string of wins. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=169.86s)]
*  The company said it met its delivery goal of 360,000 cars for the year. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=172.78s)]
*  And less than a year after breaking ground at its China plant, the carmaker met its objective [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=177.88000000000002s)]
*  for Model 3 production at the facility and held a press conference to celebrate deliveries [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=182.4s)]
*  of China-made Model 3s to Chinese customers. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=187.08s)]
*  Many people view China as the world's biggest market for electric vehicles. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=190.8s)]
*  So in order for Tesla to kind of make this journey from, you know, just a small startup [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=195.66s)]
*  to a global behemoth producing electric cars, bullish investors say that it needs to target [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=200.88s)]
*  that market. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=207.48s)]
*  So this boosted expectations for the coming year. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=208.48s)]
*  The investor momentum continued when on January 29th, Tesla posted a profit for the second [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=211.76s)]
*  quarter in a row. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=216.72s)]
*  On the earnings call, the company said it was well on its way to producing its next [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=218.32s)]
*  The Model Y compact sport utility vehicle. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=222.9s)]
*  And it told investors the business should be profitable going forward. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=226.1s)]
*  So this was around the time that Tesla shares really just started to go parabolic. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=229.86s)]
*  And you saw Wall Street investors, Main Street investors kind of all piling into Tesla shares, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=235.3s)]
*  Tesla options, and it just kind of became this huge frenzy around the company. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=242.02s)]
*  But not everyone was betting for the car company. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=247.02s)]
*  The fascinating thing about Tesla is that despite its kind of meteoric rise in the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  stock market this year, it remains one of the most popular shorts. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=255.6s)]
*  That means it's a really popular bet for investors who think that the shares are going to absolutely [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=260.44s)]
*  plummet. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=265.76s)]
*  When the stock goes up, that's painful for a short investor. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=266.76s)]
*  That means that they're losing money. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=270.04s)]
*  So some people can't hold on to these money losing positions for too long. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=271.8s)]
*  So they have to close out their position. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=275.72s)]
*  And sometimes they do that by buying Tesla stock. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=277.84s)]
*  In this kind of unusual twist, you have investors who think the shares are going to go down [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=280.85999999999996s)]
*  actually helping to drive it up. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=287.17999999999995s)]
*  But the stock run up was stopped short in March. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=290.29999999999995s)]
*  Despite investor enthusiasm, Tesla was not immune to the market effects of the coronavirus [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=293.82s)]
*  lockdowns. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=298.41999999999996s)]
*  That month, California issued stay at home orders, leading Tesla to suspend production [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=299.85999999999996s)]
*  at a factory and interrupting the company's ramp up for its newest vehicle. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=304.46s)]
*  The stock fell in March and then quickly bounced back as the market started to recover. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=309.18s)]
*  At the heart of this downturn, the Federal Reserve enacted a massive stimulus plan to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=313.78s)]
*  buoy the economy, fueling a broader recovery in the stock market that also lifted stocks [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=317.78s)]
*  like Tesla. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=322.62s)]
*  On April 29th, Tesla reported another profit, the third in a row. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=324.08s)]
*  Then through the blow of the S&P 500, the S&P was down roughly 30 percent year to date. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=328.74s)]
*  And meanwhile, even through that time frame, Tesla stock was up. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=334.34000000000003s)]
*  So despite a recession, a global pandemic that could crimp demand for cars, Tesla stock [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=337.58s)]
*  has still been resilient this year. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=344.18s)]
*  Then on June 10th, investors pushed the automaker stock past $1,000 a share for the first time [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=346.82s)]
*  ever. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=352.3s)]
*  After Musk told employees it was time to begin production on the company's all-electric [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=353.3s)]
*  semi-trailer truck. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=357.26s)]
*  By July, Tesla became the world's most valuable carmaker overtaking Toyota. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=359.06s)]
*  And on the second, Musk taunted the short sellers when shares opened above $1,200 for [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=364.38s)]
*  the first time after Tesla deliveries beat expectations and investors anticipated the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=369.86s)]
*  company's inclusion in the S&P 500 index. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=374.98s)]
*  In order to be considered for the S&P 500, a company needs to deliver a cumulative profit [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=378.38s)]
*  over four consecutive quarters, including the most recent. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=383.22s)]
*  So even before Tesla's most recent earnings report, a ton of investors were anticipating, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=386.82s)]
*  hey, we think it's going to be profitable this quarter. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=392.82s)]
*  We think it's going to be in the S&P 500. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=395.17999999999995s)]
*  And that drove the stock even higher. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=397.14s)]
*  On an earnings call on July 22nd, Tesla said it hit that goal, defying the Wall Street [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=400.09999999999997s)]
*  Bears, who expected a loss. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=405.94s)]
*  We were able to achieve a fourth consecutive profitable quarter. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=408.34s)]
*  And although the automotive industry was down about 30 percent year over year in the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=412.58s)]
*  first half of the year, we managed to grow deliveries in the first half of the year. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=416.82s)]
*  If you bought 10 shares of Tesla last June in June 2019, it would have cost you a little [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=420.9s)]
*  more than $1,700. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=426.62s)]
*  If you held on to that investment through late July, it would have been worth more than [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=429.26s)]
*  $15,000. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=433.86s)]
*  Bears still say the stock is going to go down. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=436.34000000000003s)]
*  They don't think that Tesla will bring electric vehicles to the masses. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiuB1axBvog&t=438.82s)]
