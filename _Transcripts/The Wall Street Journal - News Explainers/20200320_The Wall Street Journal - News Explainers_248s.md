# Why Coronavirus Is Making the Census Even More Challenging  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 20, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE)
*  As a global health emergency is taking hold, America is moving forward with its crucial [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=0.0s)]
*  once-a-decade census. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=6.28s)]
*  In March, the Census Bureau said an employee tested positive for the new coronavirus. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=8.74s)]
*  The worker didn't have contact with the public, but the incident is reinforcing the Bureau's [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=13.98s)]
*  need to collect information over the Internet. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=17.8s)]
*  This isn't the Bureau's only challenge as it collects surveys. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  The 2020 Census has been on the Government Accountability Office's watch list for three [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=24.1s)]
*  Those concerns, combined with pandemic-driven impediments, could make 2020's count more [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=29.98s)]
*  difficult to execute. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=34.86s)]
*  But the count must move forward because it is a foundational part of American governance. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=35.86s)]
*  The census is very important because it is the foundation of how political power is distributed [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=41.5s)]
*  in this country. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=47.14s)]
*  And so it's important to be counted and it's not just that people be included, but it be [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=48.14s)]
*  included where they reside so that political power can be equitably distributed or accurately [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=51.66s)]
*  distributed. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=56.06s)]
*  Here's how the new dynamics are reshaping 2020's count. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=57.06s)]
*  This year, most households received a letter rather than a complete census form in the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=60.900000000000006s)]
*  mail. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=65.14s)]
*  This is the first census in which there will be a widespread option to respond over the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=66.14s)]
*  Internet. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=70.34s)]
*  That's because the census wanted to move toward online response. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=71.34s)]
*  In light of the new coronavirus, the Bureau is re-emphasizing the need to respond online [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=74.02000000000001s)]
*  or by phone or by mail without having to meet a census taker. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=78.42s)]
*  This is the safest way to answer the census. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=82.54s)]
*  And that could prove crucial as the country hunkers down to increase social distance [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=85.14s)]
*  and limit the spread of the virus. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=89.38s)]
*  Online response will limit the amount of in-person enumeration needed to count everyone, which [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=92.3s)]
*  relates to another major challenge facing 2020's census. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=96.58s)]
*  Staffing. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=100.66s)]
*  Staffing has been an ongoing area of concern at the Census Bureau. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=101.66s)]
*  That problem becomes most visible at the local level. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=105.42s)]
*  One of the things that's very important is to look at the census down at almost a granular [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=108.48s)]
*  level, a very local level. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=111.98s)]
*  That's what's going to make or break the census. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=113.94s)]
*  Only about two-thirds of the country responded to the initial prompt for the 2010 census, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=116.3s)]
*  and those numbers vary at the local level. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=121.1s)]
*  For example, about 74% of Minnesotans responded to the census's first request. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=123.22s)]
*  But some counties in the state had response rates below 40%. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  Lower response rates mean that the Census Bureau needs to send temporary workers to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=132.98s)]
*  knock on doors and request responses in person. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=137.14s)]
*  But the need to increase social distance will make it harder to send field workers [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=140.84s)]
*  out to track hard-to-reach populations and others who don't respond. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=144.16s)]
*  For months, the Census Bureau struggled to recruit enough temporary workers. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=150.32s)]
*  The GAO issued this chart in February to show how far behind the Bureau had fallen. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=154.44s)]
*  The Census Bureau disputed those findings, saying that they effectively met their staffing [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=159.3s)]
*  goals. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=163.4s)]
*  But the Bureau will still have to deal with falling response rates. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=164.68s)]
*  That's because Americans in general have become less likely to answer surveys. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=168.12s)]
*  Each census that I've been involved with, the Bureau assumes a lower mail response rate [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=172.24s)]
*  than they received in the preceding census, in part because of just the complexity of [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=176.08s)]
*  counting people and the various living arrangements, but in part because of reduction in trust. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=179.88s)]
*  Which brings us to a third major challenge facing 2020's census. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  Trust. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=188.36s)]
*  In 2019, the Republican National Committee sent a 2020 congressional district census [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=189.36s)]
*  to a number of households. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=194.88s)]
*  But it was not an official census. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=196.76s)]
*  The document asked about political preferences and preferred news sources, none of which [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=199.16s)]
*  are asked on the official census. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  The questionnaire was also much longer than the official census and asked respondents [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=205.56s)]
*  to donate money to process the document. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=209.32s)]
*  As recently as March, the Trump campaign promoted the misleading prompt on Facebook. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=212.12s)]
*  Facebook later removed the ads, citing the company's census interference policy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=216.6s)]
*  But experts say that the lingering effects of confusing documents like this could further [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=221.32s)]
*  depress response rates in the country. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=225.32s)]
*  Census forms started arriving in mailboxes in mid-March. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=228.44s)]
*  The Bureau must report results to Congress no later than December of 2020. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=231.44s)]
*  Some response timetables could be shaken up as the Bureau monitors the situation and takes [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=236.0s)]
*  new guidance from public health authorities. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpansTKjKDE&t=240.72s)]
