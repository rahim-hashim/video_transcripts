# How Governments Shut Down the Internet | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 27, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM)
*  More governments are kicking people off the internet than ever before. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=0.0s)]
*  It usually happens during politically sensitive times, like elections, protests, and conflicts. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=5.0s)]
*  Last year, governments shut down the internet more frequently than in previous years, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=12.0s)]
*  according to a digital rights group that started tracking the practice in 2011. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=17.0s)]
*  For instance, in India, it happened in parts of the country more than a hundred times. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=21.0s)]
*  Authorities say shutdowns help stop unrest and the spread of fake news, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=26.0s)]
*  and even prevent cheating on school exams. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=30.0s)]
*  Advocates for an open internet say shutdowns can cripple economies and disrupt daily life, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=33.0s)]
*  all while curtailing civil rights. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=39.0s)]
*  So here's how governments can kick you off the internet. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=41.0s)]
*  Usually, when you type in a URL or hit an app icon, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=44.0s)]
*  the Domain Name System looks up that address and resolves it to a string of pre-assigned numbers. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=48.0s)]
*  In under a second, you can usually connect to the server and access a site. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=53.0s)]
*  If the government wants to block access to a specific site, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=57.0s)]
*  it can request the internet service provider to interfere with the DNS traffic. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=60.0s)]
*  The provider can then redirect traffic so it never reaches those servers. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=65.0s)]
*  This happened last year at the height of a political crisis in Venezuela, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=69.0s)]
*  when opposition leader Juan Guaido tried to seize power from President Nicolas Maduro. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=73.0s)]
*  Guaido was standing with soldiers outside a military base when he began live streaming on Twitter. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=78.0s)]
*  He called people to rise up against President Nicolas Maduro. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=87.0s)]
*  While Guaido's call to action ricocheted across the world, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=90.0s)]
*  at home, his message was blocked for a large number of internet users. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=93.0s)]
*  This trust shows that Venezuela's state-run internet provider restricted access to social media. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=98.0s)]
*  The company didn't respond to a request for comment. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=103.0s)]
*  We're looking at something similar to radio censorship or TV censorship, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=106.0s)]
*  when authorities might bleep out part of a sentence or a speech. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=111.0s)]
*  Alptoker is the founder of an internet advocacy group called NetBlocks. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=115.0s)]
*  He says it's surprisingly easy for the government to turn off access to specific sites. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=119.0s)]
*  This is basically an engineer with a button on the switch. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=124.0s)]
*  When they see something they don't like, they press the button. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=128.0s)]
*  But authorities can be more subtle in how they control the internet, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=131.0s)]
*  not just by blocking sites, but by simply slowing down the connection. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=134.0s)]
*  This is called throttling. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=139.0s)]
*  So it looks like your apps are still running when in fact the interference is at a level that makes using the internet painful. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=141.0s)]
*  So the video you're trying to watch on YouTube becomes very low-res or it keeps loading. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=147.0s)]
*  We spoke to network engineers who monitor internet censorship. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=152.0s)]
*  And they say that it's even hard for them to really pinpoint the specific reason behind a slow connection. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=156.0s)]
*  And they say that's likely why some governments have turned to throttling to shrug off accountability. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=162.0s)]
*  In some extreme cases, governments can order service providers to turn off the internet completely. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=168.0s)]
*  This happened last year during anti-government protests in Iraq, when the internet was cut off. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=174.0s)]
*  Amir Hazim is an Iraqi photographer in Baghdad, and he's been posting his photos on Instagram. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=192.0s)]
*  The Iraqi prime minister at the time said it's the government's right to restrict access [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=198.0s)]
*  when the internet is being used to stoke violence and conspiracy against the homeland. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=203.0s)]
*  Because internet blackouts disrupt critical services and can hurt the economy, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=208.0s)]
*  authorities often target specific networks and geographic areas. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=213.0s)]
*  At the height of the protests in Iraq, the government imposed daily digital curfews between 5pm to 7am. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=219.0s)]
*  Then during business hours, the government ordered service providers to turn on the connection again. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=225.0s)]
*  We spoke to private companies in several countries, and they say they have little power to refuse a request [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=231.0s)]
*  because authorities can threaten to terminate their licenses. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=236.0s)]
*  Citizens have looked for workarounds, like using VPNs that connect to networks outside of the country. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=240.0s)]
*  Some will pay for expensive satellite connections. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=246.0s)]
*  Others, like Hazim, have bought international SIM cards from Jordan that are activated before entering Iraq. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=249.0s)]
*  That helped us to keep people updated. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=255.0s)]
*  I started doing lives from Tahrir Square, showing the area around and what's happening really, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=259.0s)]
*  and how people are living, and how the government are using violence. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=267.0s)]
*  Toker says these solutions may end up encouraging more aggressive moves from the government. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=272.0s)]
*  The more people attempt to get around it, the more governments are going to try to switch it off. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=277.0s)]
*  The UN says restrictions on internet access are a violation of human rights. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=282.0s)]
*  But many countries already have laws that make it legal to shut down the internet on grounds related to national security [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=287.0s)]
*  or stopping the spread of fake news. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=293.0s)]
*  So while this might have started off as authoritarian dictatorship move, it gets encoded into laws. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=296.0s)]
*  It becomes very difficult for the public to complain about it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53q3gscB7FM&t=303.0s)]
