# Trump, Harris Tied in Swing States Despite Trump Leading on Top Issues  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc)
*  Our new Wall Street Journal poll surveyed the seven battleground states, the states that are going to decide this election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=0.0s)]
*  We find Harris leading in four of these seven states and Trump leading in three of them. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=6.68s)]
*  But the word lead has to be used loosely because these states are very close. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=11.68s)]
*  The lead that one candidate or the other has is well within the margin of error. And the mystery is this. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=17.38s)]
*  When we ask people [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=23.88s)]
*  which issues they care about, which issues are going to be most important to them when they vote, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=25.779999999999998s)]
*  we find Donald Trump by far is viewed as better at handling those issues. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=30.459999999999997s)]
*  Those are the economy and border security and immigration. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=35.86s)]
*  And yet those advantages aren't translating to a big lead in a contest against Kamala Harris. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=39.26s)]
*  And on some facets of our economic lives, like health care, the edge goes to Kamala Harris. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=45.86s)]
*  When we ask about does this candidate care about people like you, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=51.06s)]
*  Kamala Harris has an error lead. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=55.42s)]
*  Who has a leadership experience needed for the job? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=57.38s)]
*  Donald Trump has the edge. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  But voters also say that Trump, more than Harris, is the candidate who is too extreme. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=63.34s)]
*  That suggests that people see either his policy choices, say on abortion, as out of the mainstream [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  or his general style and approach, his persona as too extreme. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=77.34s)]
*  It's been a crazy chaotic political year. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=82.5s)]
*  We've had a change at the top of the Democratic ticket. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=85.53999999999999s)]
*  There were two assassination attempts on Donald Trump. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=88.22s)]
*  There's been millions of dollars in advertising and some bitter political rhetoric here. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=93.33999999999999s)]
*  This has all had the effect of pushing Americans into their partisan corners. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=98.58s)]
*  Across these seven states, we find that Donald Trump is holding 93 percent of Republican voters [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=103.86s)]
*  and Kamala Harris is holding 93 percent of Democratic voters. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=111.46s)]
*  There are very few people defecting from the party that they align with. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=116.05999999999999s)]
*  One thing we find when we compare this poll to the last time we tested the swing states, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=121.1s)]
*  when President Biden was at the top of the ticket, Trump had a narrow lead. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=125.74s)]
*  What's important, though, is how much ground Kamala Harris has made up. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=130.22s)]
*  She's gained in Arizona, in North Carolina, in Georgia. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=134.26s)]
*  This means that she has more roots to victory in the Electoral College than Joe Biden did. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=140.66s)]
*  She's competitive in all seven states, including these Sun Belt states [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=146.7s)]
*  that look to be slipping out of reach for the Democratic Party. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=151.06s)]
*  But overall, this is a highly polarized partisan electorate, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=153.9s)]
*  and people are in their partisan corners. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlARz6xGMXc&t=158.46s)]
