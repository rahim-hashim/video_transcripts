# How PlayStation Saved Sony | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 12, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE)
*  Right now, the video game industry is booming. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=0.0s)]
*  Sales of gaming hardware and accessories have spiked [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=3.84s)]
*  as consumers have been forced to stay home [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=6.62s)]
*  due to the coronavirus pandemic. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=8.94s)]
*  One of the biggest beneficiaries has been Sony, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=11.02s)]
*  maker of PlayStation. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  Its stock is surging, profits are steady, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=15.5s)]
*  and analysts predict its newest system, the PlayStation 5, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=17.82s)]
*  has the potential to be a major hit this holiday. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=21.38s)]
*  It's an impressive turnaround considering six years ago, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  Sony was on track to lose over $2 billion. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=27.08s)]
*  The electronics giant was being outsold [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=30.24s)]
*  in everything from TVs to smartphones [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  by more nimble competitors. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  Here's how Sony built its PlayStation business [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=36.68s)]
*  like a heavyweight boxer, capable of going 12 rounds [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=39.36s)]
*  to pull the company off the mat when it needed it most. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=42.8s)]
*  Sony has been an electronics pioneer since its founding. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=52.66s)]
*  In the 1950s, it was one of the first companies [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=56.34s)]
*  to build radios with tiny transistors [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=58.86s)]
*  instead of vacuum tubes. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=61.26s)]
*  These transistor radios were small, portable, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=63.06s)]
*  and became a massive hit for the company. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=65.38s)]
*  It was built around innovation, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=67.86s)]
*  whether it be the transistor radio, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=69.38s)]
*  which was a very compact, easy-to-use radio at the time, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=71.34s)]
*  the Trinitron television, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=74.72s)]
*  and perhaps most famously the Walkman in 1979, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=76.82s)]
*  and that really put them in the forefronts [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=80.18s)]
*  of the global consumer electronics industry [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=82.5s)]
*  in their first half century. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=85.06s)]
*  In 1994, the company leveraged this innovation [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=86.72s)]
*  to enter the crowded video game market [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=89.64s)]
*  with a new console, the PlayStation. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=91.9s)]
*  They were not expecting huge things out of it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=94.44s)]
*  It was just kind of like, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=99.0s)]
*  hey, this is kind of a side business for us. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=99.84s)]
*  We're launching a game system. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=103.16s)]
*  But the PlayStation had two competitive advantages [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=104.4s)]
*  under the hood. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=107.28s)]
*  The console ran on a 32-bit microprocessor, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=108.62s)]
*  a huge leap over the 16-bit processors of its predecessors, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=112.06s)]
*  and unlike the rival Nintendo 64 console, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=115.7s)]
*  it played games on CDs instead of cartridges. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=118.48s)]
*  This allowed for games to be made cheaper, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  and developers flocked to PlayStation. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=124.7s)]
*  So they released thousands of games [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  for the Sony PlayStation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=130.62s)]
*  There was something for everybody. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=131.86s)]
*  There was just this diversity of content [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=133.08s)]
*  that you didn't find with the Nintendo system. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  Over the next decade, Sony gained market share, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=138.86s)]
*  and by 1999, was shipping more consoles than Nintendo. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=141.5s)]
*  Ken Kutaragi was the mastermind [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=145.89999999999998s)]
*  behind the company's new gaming empire. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=147.78s)]
*  Ken Kutaragi, who was the head of the PlayStation business [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=150.26s)]
*  from the beginning, was a real maverick at Sony, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=153.5s)]
*  wanted to run his own business, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=155.45999999999998s)]
*  often clashed with other executives at Sony, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=157.17999999999998s)]
*  and he wanted the machine with the maximum specs. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  He didn't want to compromise on the quality [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=162.85999999999999s)]
*  of the hardware and the software. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=165.85999999999999s)]
*  By the end of the 90s, PlayStation sales made up 40% [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=167.57999999999998s)]
*  of Sony's operating profits, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=170.82s)]
*  and Kutaragi began developing a new system [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  that would be a Trojan horse of digital home entertainment. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=175.2s)]
*  The PlayStation 2 was released in 2000. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=178.72s)]
*  It featured a DVD player and offered exclusive online play [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=181.16s)]
*  for blockbuster games like Madden Football [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=185.0s)]
*  and Tiger Woods PGA Tour. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=187.28s)]
*  Paul game developers were committed to Sony, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  and they realized that was their bread and butter, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=192.44s)]
*  and Sony was the system [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  that was gonna deliver the money for them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=197.84s)]
*  That was until Microsoft released [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=200.96s)]
*  a gaming console of its own. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=202.82s)]
*  For the first time, let me now unveil Xbox. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=205.0s)]
*  The Xbox was released in 2001, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=208.66s)]
*  marking the beginning of the modern console wars [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=214.1s)]
*  that saw Sony and Microsoft battle for gamers [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=217.2s)]
*  by offering exclusive titles [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=220.1s)]
*  and packing their systems with different features. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=222.06s)]
*  Despite new competition, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=224.94s)]
*  the PlayStation 2 dominated sales, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=226.16s)]
*  eventually selling over 150 million consoles. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=228.94s)]
*  But all wasn't well at Sony. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=232.4s)]
*  Video game sales were growing, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=234.56s)]
*  but profits were declining in other divisions. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=236.04s)]
*  So many of their products either were commodified [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=238.68s)]
*  and it became the cheapest is the best, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=240.9s)]
*  or simply were overtaken by technology. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=242.98s)]
*  To cope, the company shed products and laid off workers. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=246.72s)]
*  A company as big as this one [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=250.28s)]
*  with such a wide variety of product [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=252.44s)]
*  has to organize its priorities. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=255.88s)]
*  We can't do everything. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=258.36s)]
*  The PlayStation became one of those priorities. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=260.48s)]
*  Kuduragi was placed as head [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=263.76s)]
*  of the company's next generation of electronics [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=265.2s)]
*  and tasked with combining traditionally siloed divisions [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=268.04s)]
*  to integrate PlayStation technology into other products. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=271.06s)]
*  Sony was looking at the PlayStation [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=274.6s)]
*  as a driver of their whole consumer electronics strategy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=278.5s)]
*  To pull this off, the electronics maker went all in in 2006 [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=283.9s)]
*  with its next console, the PlayStation 3. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=287.7s)]
*  The goal was to make it [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=290.78s)]
*  the centerpiece of home entertainment. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=291.94s)]
*  Sony spent billions of dollars beefing up the game machine [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=294.42s)]
*  with state-of-the-art technology. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=297.42s)]
*  This included a Blu-ray DVD player [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=299.18s)]
*  and a new supercharged microprocessor called the cell chip. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=301.9s)]
*  PS3! [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=305.46s)]
*  PS3! [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=306.86s)]
*  But the cutting edge console had problems from the start. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=308.22s)]
*  Manufacturing complications with the Blu-ray player [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=312.06s)]
*  forced the release date to be pushed back, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=314.82s)]
*  allowing Microsoft to grab a year head start [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=317.41999999999996s)]
*  with its new system, the Xbox 360. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=319.65999999999997s)]
*  And the cell processor proved to be too powerful [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=322.97999999999996s)]
*  for its own good, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=325.74s)]
*  frustrating game makers and gamers alike. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=327.09999999999997s)]
*  Gamers, you know, they like games before anything else. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=329.85999999999996s)]
*  And PlayStation 3 was a game system [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=333.41999999999996s)]
*  with all this other baggage that made it cost $100 more. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=336.34s)]
*  It was also difficult for developers to develop [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=340.78s)]
*  for the PlayStation 3 versus the Xbox 360. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=344.78s)]
*  A wildly successful Nintendo Wii console [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=350.05999999999995s)]
*  and free mobile gaming cut deeply into PS3 sales. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=352.41999999999996s)]
*  By 2014, Sony had suffered an annual loss [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=356.38s)]
*  for four out of the previous five years. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=359.5s)]
*  Before, the company had used its video game business [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=361.94s)]
*  as a crutch. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=364.73999999999995s)]
*  Now it needed to use it as a lifeline. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=365.94s)]
*  They really felt that there was no other option [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=368.18s)]
*  but to really scale back those products [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=370.90000000000003s)]
*  that were no longer profitable on a large scale [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=373.18s)]
*  and really focus on their winners. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=376.74s)]
*  Those winners included image sensors Sony made [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=378.62s)]
*  for smartphone cameras and the PlayStation 4, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=381.18s)]
*  which the company had just released. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=384.22s)]
*  At that point, they really had no choice [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=386.18s)]
*  but to put most of their energy into the PlayStation [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=388.02s)]
*  because it was the only product left [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=392.18s)]
*  in the hardware side with growth prospects. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=394.18s)]
*  To recapture gamers, experts say the company focused [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=396.58000000000004s)]
*  on what made previous consoles successful, games. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=400.1s)]
*  It expanded its online ecosystem by offering games [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=404.06s)]
*  that were free to play [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=407.34000000000003s)]
*  through its PlayStation Plus subscription service. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=408.5s)]
*  And it allowed cross-console play [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=411.82000000000005s)]
*  for popular titles like Fortnite, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=413.70000000000005s)]
*  meaning Xbox and PlayStation gamers [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=416.02000000000004s)]
*  could play together online. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=418.02000000000004s)]
*  And Sony really just lays their focus [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=420.46000000000004s)]
*  on the idea of gamers and having the best game system [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=422.54s)]
*  out there versus the system that'll do everything. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=427.62s)]
*  By 2018, there were 34 million PlayStation Plus subscribers, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=430.66s)]
*  creating a consistent gaming revenue stream [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=434.90000000000003s)]
*  for Sony beyond selling consoles, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=437.46000000000004s)]
*  leading the company to post record operating profits [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=440.26s)]
*  that year. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=442.78000000000003s)]
*  And by 2020, Sony's market cap had reached $100 billion, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=443.62s)]
*  largely because of video games. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=448.3s)]
*  So PlayStation 4 has had about 100 million unit sales [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=450.38s)]
*  over the life of the machine, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=453.54s)]
*  and they say they want to exceed that [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=455.1s)]
*  over the life of the PlayStation 5 [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=457.14s)]
*  and also get off to a faster start. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=459.38s)]
*  That fast start may be fueled by the recent rise [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=461.78s)]
*  in video game-related spending, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=464.82s)]
*  but analysts say the new Xbox consoles [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=466.86s)]
*  will provide plenty of competition for the PlayStation 5. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=469.14s)]
*  And for Sony to stay in the ring, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=472.86s)]
*  the electronics innovator will have to keep innovating. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=385HF18nbbE&t=474.74s)]
