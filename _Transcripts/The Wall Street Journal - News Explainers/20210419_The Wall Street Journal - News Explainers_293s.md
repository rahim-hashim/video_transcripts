# How the Pandemic Made Lumber America's Hottest Commodity  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 19, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc)
*  Lumber has never been more expensive. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=0.88s)]
*  Two by fours are more than three times their typical price. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=3.66s)]
*  Other wood products that we use to build houses [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=6.88s)]
*  like plywood have also soared. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=8.9s)]
*  The increases are thanks to an unexpected boom in demand. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=10.86s)]
*  Even in the broad rally that has pushed up commodity prices [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=14.26s)]
*  across the board from crude oil to corn, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=16.98s)]
*  the dramatic climb in wood prices stands out. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=19.82s)]
*  Lumber futures have more than tripled [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=22.34s)]
*  since the rally began in April, 2020. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=24.14s)]
*  No one expected wood prices to soar, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=26.740000000000002s)]
*  not even sawmills, lumber dealers, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=29.04s)]
*  and others who profit from rising prices. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=31.24s)]
*  Here's how lumber prices climbed to records [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=33.94s)]
*  during the pandemic, who has profited, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=35.98s)]
*  and why those who grow the trees haven't benefited at all. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=38.24s)]
*  When the pandemic set in, sawmills shut down [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=43.5s)]
*  like many other businesses. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=45.84s)]
*  Before the lockdown, it was shaping up [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=47.5s)]
*  to be a strong home building season. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  But when the global economy ground to a halt in 2020, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=51.4s)]
*  new housing construction in the US plummeted. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=54.42s)]
*  At the onset of the pandemic, lumber mills shut down, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=57.64s)]
*  dealers liquidated their inventories, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=61.02s)]
*  and speculators started shorting lumber futures, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=63.22s)]
*  expecting prices to plunge. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=65.82s)]
*  No one thought that there was a housing boom coming [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=67.86s)]
*  or a remodeling boom. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=70.42s)]
*  Hunker down homeowners remodeled en masse, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=71.86s)]
*  and low mortgage rates drove demand for suburban housing, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=74.42s)]
*  while restaurants raced to construct [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=77.5s)]
*  outdoor dining accommodations. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=79.22s)]
*  Lumber and plywood started flying off shelves. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=81.14s)]
*  The building boom lifted the share price [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=83.9s)]
*  of home improvement giants Lowe's and Hope Depot [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  ahead of the broader market. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=88.16s)]
*  Wood was in short supply. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=90.08s)]
*  Sawmills ramped up capacity, but couldn't catch up, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  leading to a surge in prices. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  Besides prices rising, demand is such [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  that some people can't even get the right amounts [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  or the right products of lumber. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=102.24s)]
*  And you're seeing this throughout, you know, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=104.0s)]
*  across products from a two-by-four to plywood [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=105.8s)]
*  to engineered products for home builders. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=109.72s)]
*  Sawmills have been big beneficiaries. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=112.32s)]
*  Owners of Southern mills have seen profits skyrocket, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=114.72s)]
*  and their share prices have surged. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=117.9s)]
*  Farther up the wood supply chain, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  those who grow the trees that become the two-by-fours [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=122.1s)]
*  have been left out. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=124.78s)]
*  Timber growers supply mills with logs, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=126.26s)]
*  which are sawed into lumber and mashed into pulp. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=128.66s)]
*  Prices for logs and lumber usually move in unison, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=131.52s)]
*  but lately their prices have diverged. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=134.66s)]
*  Much of the nation's logs are harvested in the US South, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=137.04s)]
*  and Southern growers have gained nothing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=140.14s)]
*  from the run-up in prices for finished lumber. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=141.9s)]
*  Earl and Wanda Bars have been growing timber [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=144.7s)]
*  for 35 years in central Georgia. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=146.88s)]
*  They say prices for their timber have not kept pace [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=149.22s)]
*  with the run-up in lumber. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=151.64s)]
*  The landowner, us, we haven't benefited [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=153.0s)]
*  from the increase in the price of lumber. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  When I was a procurement forester, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=158.6s)]
*  we were paying $25 a ton for saw timber [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  on the stump 40 years ago. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=167.64s)]
*  And if you bring that forward today, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=170.0s)]
*  the market is $25 or less on the stump today, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=172.5s)]
*  and that's in constant dollars. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=176.1s)]
*  That's not taking into account inflation [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=177.98s)]
*  and other things that have gone up to grow those trees. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=180.66s)]
*  The problem is that there's so many trees. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=183.89999999999998s)]
*  Between 1980 and 2020, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=186.5s)]
*  the volume of wood per acre of timberland [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  in many Southern counties has more than quadrupled. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=190.82s)]
*  In the 1980s, the federal government paid [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=193.82s)]
*  a lot of landowners in the South to plant trees. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=195.94s)]
*  The government wanted to take cropland out of rotation [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=198.78s)]
*  and to stop having a lot of corn and soybeans. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=201.68s)]
*  So the prices would rise in those markets. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=204.04s)]
*  And they pay people to grow trees [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  because those trees would sit on the land for decades [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=207.92s)]
*  and just grow and accumulate value [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=210.32s)]
*  and eventually be ready to be made [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=212.44s)]
*  into things like lumber and plywood. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=213.88s)]
*  Decades later, many of those trees are being harvested, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=216.12s)]
*  which has flooded the market with an abundance of timber. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=218.92s)]
*  There's so many trees, in fact, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=221.88s)]
*  that mills can basically name their price for the logs [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=223.48s)]
*  that they take in and saw into boards. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  The supply and demand is so out of whack [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  that analysts and a lot of investors in sawmill companies [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=230.85999999999999s)]
*  think it could be a decade or two [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=233.7s)]
*  before enough trees are cut down [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=235.45999999999998s)]
*  that supply and demand is back in balance, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=237.38s)]
*  even with the increased demand received today [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=240.22s)]
*  for wood products. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=242.45999999999998s)]
*  Earl Barr says the consolidation of the market [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=243.7s)]
*  has also made it difficult to sell timber. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=245.94s)]
*  20 years ago, if we'd have had a track of timber [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=248.42s)]
*  that we would have put up for bids, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=251.2s)]
*  we'd have gotten at least 10 independent bids, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=252.66s)]
*  competitive bids for that track of wood. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=256.28s)]
*  Now we're seeing fewer than five, if you're lucky. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=258.78s)]
*  We're not looking at what is happening to our markets. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=262.84s)]
*  Are we playing on a level playing field? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=266.88s)]
*  Are we able to put our trees [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=269.35999999999996s)]
*  into a truly competitive marketplace? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=272.32s)]
*  Analysts do expect lumber prices will eventually go down, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=275.64s)]
*  but with the housing market continuing to run red hot, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=279.0s)]
*  the price continues to rise. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5MkGbXXKc&t=281.91999999999996s)]
