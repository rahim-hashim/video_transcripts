# What Is Options Trading and Why Is It on the Rise?  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI)
*  2020 is shaping up to be a record year for betting on stock options. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=0.0s)]
*  On an average day, traders drew up more than 26 million such contracts, a huge rise from [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=5.84s)]
*  the year before. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=11.24s)]
*  Nine out of 10 of the busiest days in the options market's entire history, going back [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=12.24s)]
*  to 1973, have happened this year in 2020. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=18.68s)]
*  Option contracts give traders a way to make a buck by betting on which way the markets [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=23.68s)]
*  will swing, which makes them especially attractive when markets are choppy like they've been [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=27.8s)]
*  this year. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=32.28s)]
*  But there's a catch. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=33.44s)]
*  Options are a risky investment, sometimes even riskier than stocks. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=34.76s)]
*  And as more beginners try their hand at trading, experts warn of big losses. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=38.88s)]
*  At its most basic level, an option is a contractual agreement between two parties regarding a [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=48.0s)]
*  particular asset, say a stock. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=52.84s)]
*  And there are two basic types, calls and puts. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=56.28s)]
*  With a call option, the buyer gets the right to purchase shares at an agreed upon price [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=59.96s)]
*  and date. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=65.12s)]
*  If the trader doesn't buy the shares in that window, she loses the right to buy the shares [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=66.36s)]
*  at that price. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=71.04s)]
*  And that's an important feature of these options contracts. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=72.04s)]
*  You don't have to exercise them. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  You simply have the option to do so within a specific time frame. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=76.84s)]
*  When a trader buys calls, they're typically making a bet that the asset will rise in value [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=81.4s)]
*  If it does, she can profit. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=86.4s)]
*  Let's walk through an example. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=89.44s)]
*  Shares of a company are trading at one hundred dollars on the day the option contract is [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=91.72s)]
*  bought. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  A trader secures the option to purchase 100 shares at one hundred twenty dollars each [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  at some point for the next month. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=102.08s)]
*  In this scenario, one hundred twenty dollars is the strike price. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=104.56s)]
*  The trader that buys the contract thinks the stock will rise, so she pays a premium of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=109.16s)]
*  three dollars per share or for this contract, three hundred dollars total. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=114.56s)]
*  Many investors are using these options contracts as trading tools, and often they don't even [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=119.64s)]
*  have an intention to exercise them. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=125.04s)]
*  For example, if you buy an option and the contract itself rises in value, you might [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=127.84s)]
*  sell that option contract in the secondary market. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=133.32s)]
*  In this case, the call holder is using the option contract as a trading tool, not dealing [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=137.28s)]
*  with the underlying shares. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=142.12s)]
*  But this type of trading can get complicated. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  Sometimes it's not as simple. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=146.44s)]
*  And that's because there's a lot of different inputs to options pricing. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=148.24s)]
*  That includes the strike price that you're buying the option for, the time to expiration, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=152.88s)]
*  and also the implied volatility or how much the stock is expected to swing up or down [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=158.96s)]
*  in the future. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=165.12s)]
*  The option buyer has other ways to profit as well. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=166.68s)]
*  If the share value rises higher than the strike price and the premium paid, the buyer can [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=169.28s)]
*  exercise the contract. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=174.44s)]
*  In this example, say the share price rises to one hundred thirty five dollars, which [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=176.36s)]
*  is above the strike price and premium combined. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=180.28s)]
*  The call holder can buy the stocks for one hundred twenty dollars and sell it on the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=183.88s)]
*  market for one hundred thirty five dollars, pocketing the difference. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=187.64s)]
*  But let's say the shares price never rises above one hundred twenty three dollars. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=191.64s)]
*  In this case, the contract holder doesn't have to buy the stock. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=196.68s)]
*  She can toss the contract in the trash and walk away, having only lost the premium of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  three dollars per share. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=204.6s)]
*  But this is where it gets risky for amateurs. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=206.44s)]
*  These losses can add up quickly. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=209.24s)]
*  Options can seem like a relatively cheaper way to sometimes bet on expensive stocks. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=211.56s)]
*  But you know, if if your hunch is wrong a few times, that can be several hundred dollars [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  at a time just kind of going down the drain and potentially burning a hole in your portfolio. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=222.04s)]
*  You know, you may think, oh, I just need to put down two hundred dollars or three hundred [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=227.28s)]
*  dollars for this options premium. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=231.16s)]
*  And if the stock does this, I'll be right and I can make a quick 40 percent return. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  But if you're wrong a few times, that's a lot of money for a lot of people. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  And this happens frequently. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=243.2s)]
*  Many options go unexercised. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=244.68s)]
*  Now the other kind of options trade is a put. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=247.2s)]
*  In a put contract, a trader who owns a stock is buying the right to sell that asset to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=250.88s)]
*  someone else for a particular price by a particular date. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=255.96s)]
*  A trader might buy a put if they think the stock will fall or if they want to hedge their holdings. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  Similar to a call option, the trader has the choice to sell or walk away from the deal [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=265.2s)]
*  and lose the premium. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=269.96s)]
*  People often use put options to bet on stock declines or hedge their portfolios, kind of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=271.84s)]
*  like a stock insurance. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=278.92s)]
*  So a portfolio manager could use a put option to, you know, protect a portfolio from bigger [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=280.32s)]
*  declines in the S&P 500 or something like that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=286.08s)]
*  So those are the fundamentals. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=290.84s)]
*  Now here's why options are popular. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=292.64s)]
*  Investors like options partly because the premium can let an investor control more assets [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=296.0s)]
*  than they otherwise could afford. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=300.76s)]
*  They can be kind of a cheaper way to bet on, you know, somewhat expensive stocks. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=302.44s)]
*  For example, Amazon, you know, has been recently trading around $3,100 a share. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=307.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, you could buy an option contract type Amazon, which technically gives you control [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=314.12s)]
*  over 100 shares of Amazon for a few hundred dollars. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=320.64000000000004s)]
*  Another reason why options are popular this year. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=325.04s)]
*  Big swings give investors more chances to bet. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=327.72s)]
*  The pandemic and election have led to huge fluctuations in stock prices, which has given [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=330.88000000000005s)]
*  traders more opportunities to bet using option contracts. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=335.56s)]
*  Another reason people at home have more time on their hands and are trading frequently. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=339.92s)]
*  Recently small trades of a single contract made up 8.7% of all options activity, according [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=345.48s)]
*  to trade alert data. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=351.2s)]
*  Those traders are taking a risk because making the right call or put is difficult, if not [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=353.36s)]
*  impossible even for the most advanced traders. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=358.36s)]
*  Let's mention the fees and capital gains taxes, which can eat into your profits. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=361.48s)]
*  It can be really tempting to make these short term, relatively cheap bets on where individual [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=366.0s)]
*  stocks or the market will go. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  But it's really hard to figure out what the stock market is going to do next. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=373.64000000000004s)]
*  And if you guess a few times wrong, you could be out a lot of money. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=377.72s)]
*  For a smaller investor, that means that consistent success trading options is tricky. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=382.36s)]
*  Regardless, traders are free to swim in the choppy waters if they wish. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibgWpi2d6QI&t=387.64s)]
