# Why It's So Hard for Meta, PayPal and X to Build a Super App Like WeChat  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc)
*  On your way to the office, a message comes in from your boss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=0.0s)]
*  Can you grab them a coffee? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  They pay you back in a different app. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=6.0s)]
*  You go to another app to place an order for pickup. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=8.64s)]
*  And your mobile wallet needs to be updated. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Okay, there. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=15.44s)]
*  Now coffee, which took four apps to accomplish. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=17.36s)]
*  But in China, it takes just one. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=21.96s)]
*  WeChat, a super app. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=24.88s)]
*  You just don't have to futz around with your phone, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=26.72s)]
*  remembering different passwords, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=29.36s)]
*  opening and closing different apps. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=31.04s)]
*  It just makes it easy. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=32.68s)]
*  So why isn't there a super app in the U.S.? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=34.4s)]
*  My idea would be like, how about if we just copy WeChat? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=37.36s)]
*  Though some apps have multiple functions, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=40.76s)]
*  creating a super app in the U.S. is the holy grail [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  for some tech CEOs, and for good reason. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=45.959999999999994s)]
*  Take another look at WeChat. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=49.4s)]
*  The app launched in 2011 [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  as a social media and messaging service. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=54.12s)]
*  By the next year, it added a PayPal-like payment option. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=57.0s)]
*  And in the following years, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  it would integrate a slew of other features, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=62.68s)]
*  including games, shopping, food delivery, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=65.24s)]
*  healthcare, and mini-apps. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=67.64s)]
*  It really sort of does everything. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=69.6s)]
*  In some ways, it's a stand-in for the internet itself. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=72.2s)]
*  And users liked it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=75.52s)]
*  By 2022, WeChat had 1.3 billion active users [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=77.64s)]
*  and helped its parent company [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=82.04s)]
*  bring in a revenue of about $81 billion. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  The beauty of a super app is that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=86.72000000000001s)]
*  you're able to move seamlessly between different functions, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  share information and data [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=91.64s)]
*  between the different parts of that super app. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=93.68s)]
*  That's what makes it work. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=95.68s)]
*  And that data is the big draw for companies. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=97.4s)]
*  Let's look back at the apps you used [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  to make that coffee order again. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=102.56s)]
*  Apps in the U.S. are largely restricted [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=104.76s)]
*  from tracking you across your phone. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  So each company is only collecting data [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=109.12s)]
*  while their app is open. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=111.48s)]
*  But with WeChat, you don't have to leave it [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=113.28s)]
*  to make that order or message your boss [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=115.44s)]
*  or even post a photo of that coffee on social media. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=117.84s)]
*  That one company gets your data for all of it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=121.24s)]
*  Having a better understanding of what people are purchasing [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=124.72s)]
*  when they're purchasing those things, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  that becomes invaluable for a business. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=129.56s)]
*  Or if you're a government for tax purposes. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=133.32s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why companies [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=137.96s)]
*  from multiple industries in the U.S. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=140.16s)]
*  have made attempts at creating a super app. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=142.36s)]
*  But their growth has been slowed by several things. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=145.32s)]
*  A super app in the U.S. would have to contend [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  against thousands of other apps. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=151.16s)]
*  And changing consumer behavior can be difficult. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  We're not really used to using one app for everything. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=156.76s)]
*  And that's why when companies like Facebook in the past [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=159.76s)]
*  have tried to launch singular apps [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=163.28s)]
*  that do more than one thing at a time, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  consumers have largely rejected them. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=168.24s)]
*  Facebook Messenger said it would simplify its app back in 2018 [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=170.32s)]
*  after adding features like games. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=174.56s)]
*  Its head at the time said that the app [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=176.96s)]
*  had become too cluttered. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=179.12s)]
*  Another key issue is incorporating a payment system. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=181.4s)]
*  Take Snap, for example. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=185.08s)]
*  Its payment system Snapcash shut down after four years, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=186.68s)]
*  while apps like Benmo and Zelle were growing. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=190.2s)]
*  If you can integrate that payment system into a super app, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=193.52s)]
*  it just makes that app much more sticky. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  But it also means, in most cases, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=200.28s)]
*  that you can control the transaction costs. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=203.16s)]
*  Maybe you're making a better margin in the transaction. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  And as your user base grows, you start to scale. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=209.0s)]
*  But integrating that payment system is a big lift in the U.S. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=213.28s)]
*  A lot of tech companies aren't also a financial services [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=217.76s)]
*  company right out of the box. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=220.44s)]
*  It's complicated. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=221.92s)]
*  There's regulations involved. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=222.76s)]
*  There's different international rules and things like that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  Facebook's attempt at integrating a crypto payment system [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  failed in part because lawmakers and regulators [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=230.52s)]
*  were concerned about payments being used for illicit activity. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=237.32000000000002s)]
*  has cracked down on big tech platforms using payment [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  systems in recent years. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=242.04000000000002s)]
*  And data privacy can also become a concern [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=244.16000000000003s)]
*  for consumers and lawmakers. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=246.88s)]
*  Right now, a lot of people distrust the big tech companies. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  And the idea of a single tech company, like a Meta [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  or an Amazon or a Google, offering us an app that really [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=257.8s)]
*  houses so many different things, from online payments [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=262.44s)]
*  to bill management to health records, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  is kind of scary to people. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  And that becomes an issue for companies. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=273.08s)]
*  I don't think at this point technology companies are [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=275.4s)]
*  interested in making it look like they are consolidating [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=278.08s)]
*  their control over our digital lives any more [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=282.08s)]
*  than they already have. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=285.2s)]
*  And that would just invite regulatory scrutiny. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=286.16s)]
*  Some experts and analysts think the future for super apps [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=288.72s)]
*  in the US may look different than WeChat. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=292.0s)]
*  I think the path forward for the super app concept [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  in the United States has more to do with verticals [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=298.88000000000005s)]
*  than sort of a one ring to rule them all. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  So, for example, a single health care app [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=304.20000000000005s)]
*  might house your medical information, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=306.8s)]
*  as well as features for making appointments and payments. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=308.72s)]
*  The first champion that emerges and creates [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=312.32000000000005s)]
*  a seamless, frictionless, super app-like program [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=314.76s)]
*  that allow doctors to plug in their data, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  electronic health records stuff. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=323.12s)]
*  I think that that is gonna be a huge, huge game changer, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=324.8s)]
*  a massive disruptor. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPLL8-919Bc&t=328.76s)]
