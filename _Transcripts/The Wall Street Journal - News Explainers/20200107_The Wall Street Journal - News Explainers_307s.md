# How the Quds Force Extended Iran's Influence in the Region | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg)
*  Major General Qasem Soleimani, killed in a US drone strike on January 3rd, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=0.0s)]
*  was commander of a clandestine arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=5.22s)]
*  known as the Quds Force. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=9.72s)]
*  Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=11.72s)]
*  but we caught him in the act and terminated him. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=19.52s)]
*  The Quds Force is in charge of the IRGC's international activities [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=26.4s)]
*  and specializes in guerrilla warfare and armed insurgency. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=30.52s)]
*  The killing of General Soleimani marks a major escalation in the US's conflict with Iran, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=34.96s)]
*  but the US's history with the Quds Force goes all the way back to the Iranian Revolution. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=40.36s)]
*  Experts say Iran has used it to gain influence beyond its borders, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  deter enemies from attacking Iran itself, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  and disrupt the efforts of America and its allies in the Middle East. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=50.84s)]
*  So the Quds Force is the arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=54.839999999999996s)]
*  that is charged with exporting the revolution. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=62.32s)]
*  Quds means Jerusalem, and they want to see their banners flying over Jerusalem, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=66.2s)]
*  and so the Quds Force being the external operations arm, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=70.84s)]
*  takes that as its name and as its in principle objective. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=74.72s)]
*  The Quds Force doesn't have combat units of its own. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=79.08s)]
*  It doesn't put brigades or divisions on the ground. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=83.08s)]
*  It works to train, to raise, recruit, and train, and equip, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=86.0s)]
*  and then lead proxies who do most of the fighting. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=91.2s)]
*  The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=96.24s)]
*  was established after the Iranian Revolution in 1979 [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=99.92s)]
*  as a force to defend Iran against internal and external threats. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=103.92s)]
*  Experts say the Quds Force was later formed during or after the Iran-Iraq War [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=108.0s)]
*  as the country's de facto external affairs branch. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=112.96s)]
*  In the 1980s, the IRGC deployed forces abroad [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=116.8s)]
*  to cultivate one of its first allied militias, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  the Lebanese Shia movement Hezbollah. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  Hezbollah, then known as the Islamic Jihad Organization, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=124.72s)]
*  took credit for the 1983 and 1984 bombings [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=128.16s)]
*  of the U.S. Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=131.4s)]
*  In 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=134.44s)]
*  announced sanctions against a Hezbollah operative [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=137.48s)]
*  accused of carrying out a 1994 bombing in Argentina. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=140.0s)]
*  In 2015, another Hezbollah operative was arrested [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=143.44s)]
*  for a 1996 bombing that killed U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  In 1997 or 1998, Iran-Iraq War veteran Qasem Soleimani [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=150.08s)]
*  became the commander of the Quds Force. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=154.88s)]
*  After the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=158.12s)]
*  Soleimani built up opposition forces in Iraq [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=160.8s)]
*  and across the Middle East by training and arming militia groups. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=163.16s)]
*  The most notorious thing that the Quds Force did in Iraq [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=168.48s)]
*  was to provide their Iraqi proxies [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=173.96s)]
*  with a new type of anti-tank weapon [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=177.28s)]
*  called an explosively formed penetrator, or EFP. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=179.84s)]
*  And with that device, among other things, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=183.64s)]
*  the Quds Force is responsible for killing hundreds of American [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=186.36s)]
*  servicemen and women in Iraq and wounding thousands. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=190.4s)]
*  The Trump administration said that Iran-backed militias [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=194.92s)]
*  were responsible for the deaths of 608 U.S. troops in Iraq [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=197.64s)]
*  between 2003 and 2011. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=201.23999999999998s)]
*  We understood that they were recruiting, training, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  and equipping the Shia militias in Iraq, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  but we chose to fight them in Iraq, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  and we chose not to take the war to Iran itself. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=215.11999999999998s)]
*  Instead, the U.S. issued sanctions [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  against Quds Force leaders, including General Soleimani. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=220.88s)]
*  The Trump administration declared the IRGC [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=224.32s)]
*  a terrorist organization in 2019. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=226.64s)]
*  After the U.S. carried out airstrikes [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=229.64s)]
*  against Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=231.2s)]
*  supporters of an Iran-backed militia [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  tried to storm the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=236.04s)]
*  This culminated with the strike against General Soleimani [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=239.04s)]
*  on January 3, 2020. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=241.6s)]
*  The attack on General Soleimani wasn't just strategic, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=244.11999999999998s)]
*  but symbolic as well. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=246.76s)]
*  Qasem Soleimani was a unique figure. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=248.72s)]
*  He was at the center of many of the most important relationships [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  that the Quds Force had with its proxies. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=257.96s)]
*  There was a real cult of personality [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=260.8s)]
*  that was built around him, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=262.52s)]
*  not just in the Quds Force and the IRGC, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=264.2s)]
*  but in Iran generally and among Shia in the region. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=265.76s)]
*  He has been replaced by his deputy, Ismail Ghani, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=269.4s)]
*  who does not have anything like that charisma, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  certainly does not have anything like that name recognition. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=277.0s)]
*  The biggest question going forward [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=281.04s)]
*  might be how effectively the new Quds Force commander [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=282.36s)]
*  connects with the militia commanders [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=284.72s)]
*  General Soleimani had cultivated in the Middle East. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=286.36s)]
*  The organization is not going to collapse, but it will change. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=289.24s)]
*  There will be a period of adjustment here [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=295.4s)]
*  where they figure out how the world is going to run for them [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=297.12s)]
*  without Qasem Soleimani to run it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbVU9eAAPYg&t=300.28s)]
