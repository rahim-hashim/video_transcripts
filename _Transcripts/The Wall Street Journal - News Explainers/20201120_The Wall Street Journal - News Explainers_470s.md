# Macy’s Star Shone Bright for Over 150 Years. Now It’s Flickering | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 20, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM)
*  Macy's is the brand long identified with the kickoff of the holiday shopping season. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=0.0s)]
*  And for years, it's spent big to identify its star logo with star power. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=8.76s)]
*  Almost midnight. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Macy's Black Friday sale. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  But lately, it hasn't been all holiday cheer. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=17.88s)]
*  And that was before the coronavirus crisis forced it to temporarily shutter its doors. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=21.06s)]
*  The retailer has fared better than some of its peers. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=26.0s)]
*  In the first half of 2020, 18 major retailers have filed for Chapter 11 protection. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=28.96s)]
*  Macy's is not, but the historic company is hurting, raising questions about how far its [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=34.6s)]
*  star could fall. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=40.34s)]
*  Macy's first opened as a dry goods store on 14th Street in Manhattan in 1858. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  Near the turn of the century, two German-Jewish immigrant brothers, Nathan and Isidor Strauss, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  bought a controlling interest in the company. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=55.16s)]
*  And in 1902, they moved it 20 blocks north to the store's present flagship location [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  at Herald Square. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=62.76s)]
*  It became part of an upscale New York shopping district known as Ladies Mile. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=64.38s)]
*  The brothers took the company public in 1911 on the New York Stock Exchange. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=69.74s)]
*  The following year, Isidor Strauss died along with his wife Ida in the Titanic disaster. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=74.18s)]
*  Nathan Strauss continued growing the business, and in 1924, the company expanded to take [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=79.92s)]
*  over nearly the entire block across from Herald Square. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=85.12s)]
*  And the retailer heralded itself as the largest store in the world. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=88.56s)]
*  That same year, 10,000 people gathered in front of its store to watch a small procession [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=93.76s)]
*  which would eventually become the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=98.2s)]
*  The company survived the Great Depression, and by the mid-1940s, with American servicemen [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=102.48s)]
*  returning home from World War II, business was booming. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=107.44s)]
*  Single-day holiday sales passed a million dollars for two years straight, which would [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=111.32s)]
*  be more than $14 million today. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  During the Cold War, the brand became a symbol of American capitalism and consumer choice. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  The store was shown off to a top communist leader during his 1959 diplomatic visit to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=124.2s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=128.76s)]
*  Before the store opens, Micoyan is escorted through Macy's for a cross-section of what's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=129.76s)]
*  offered the American shopper. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=134.76s)]
*  The company expanded around the country. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=136.76s)]
*  By the mid-1970s, it had a chain of 72 department stores in 10 states. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=138.72s)]
*  Sales grew into the 1980s. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=143.88s)]
*  Then in 1986, the retailer's chairman and CEO, Edward Finkelstein, took the company [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=146.0s)]
*  private in a $3.5 billion leveraged buyout deal. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=151.12s)]
*  And the leveraged buyout loaded the company with debt, and that debt eventually tipped [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=157.32s)]
*  it into bankruptcy protection. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=161.92s)]
*  In 1994, Federated, a rival department store chain based in Ohio, agreed to acquire the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=164.68s)]
*  brand. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=170.24s)]
*  They bought Macy's out of bankruptcy. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=171.24s)]
*  And then you fast forward to 2005, when Federated at the time was the number one department [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=174.4s)]
*  store chain in the country, it merged with the number two player, May Department Stores [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=181.08s)]
*  Company, and renamed itself Macy's. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=186.08s)]
*  And that's where we get the sort of current incarnation of Macy's Inc. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  It was a landmark deal that created the first truly national department store chain with [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=193.48s)]
*  stores from coast to coast. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=198.44s)]
*  And they had, you know, beloved brands, Marshall Fields and Chicago, Filene's. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=200.48s)]
*  They had sort of these local brands around the country that they eventually did away [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=206.54s)]
*  with and renamed all the stores Macy's. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  Federated sought to give all of them a coherent image with splashy national TV ads that starred [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=213.28s)]
*  the celebrities who sold branded products in their stores. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  Only one star can bring all these stars together. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=222.0s)]
*  That's the magic of Macy's. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=225.6s)]
*  It's good to be back here at Macy's. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  Thank you all for coming. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=229.96s)]
*  I'm very excited for my new shoe line. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=231.32s)]
*  And then the economy tumbled. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=234.08s)]
*  Signs of a recession were in the air between dismal retail figures and the subprime mortgage [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  crisis. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  In 2008, the Great Recession brought a sharp slowdown in consumer spending and steep losses [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  to the company's balance sheet. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=247.52s)]
*  The Great Recession of 2008, you know, was challenging for all the brick and mortar [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=249.12s)]
*  chains and Macy's in particular, you know, struggled during that period. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  It wasn't until 2010 that Macy's returned to profitability, thanks in part to double [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=259.68s)]
*  digit growth in online sales. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=265.0s)]
*  By this point, it operated more than 800 department stores in the U.S. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=267.92s)]
*  For the first time, all 800 Macy's stores will open at midnight on Thanksgiving. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=271.96s)]
*  But for the retailer and its peers, the post recession good times didn't last long. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=277.44s)]
*  All of a sudden, the impact of Amazon and online shopping really started to eat into [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=282.76s)]
*  their sales and margins. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=289.04s)]
*  And traditional brick and mortar chains woke up to the reality that they had way too many [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=290.88s)]
*  stores and chains like Macy's, the Gap, you know, these beloved sort of retail brands [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=296.32s)]
*  that were in every mall started closing stores. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=302.32s)]
*  Big box retailer Macy's is saying goodbye to three malls right here in Hampton Roads, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=305.91999999999996s)]
*  leaving a big impact on more than 250 employees. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=310.79999999999995s)]
*  And a big heartbreak to thousands of shoppers. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  The company continued cutting costs, closing stores, and in 2014, it laid off 1,800 workers [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=317.11999999999995s)]
*  to try to save $100 million a year. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=323.23999999999995s)]
*  The good news for Macy's, it had an online strategy that was working. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  Macy's.com became the seventh most popular online store in the U.S., but online sales [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=331.16s)]
*  proved to be less profitable. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=336.92s)]
*  You know, for traditional retailers like Macy's, shifting your business online presents particular [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=339.12s)]
*  challenges. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  Online sales tend to be less profitable than sales in a physical store. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=346.08000000000004s)]
*  You've got all kinds of shipping costs really eat into the profit margin. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=349.92s)]
*  Then came the pandemic. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=354.6s)]
*  Businesses across the country forced to shut their doors already leading to absolutely [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=356.6s)]
*  stunning increases on unemployment claims. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=360.04s)]
*  All that inventory literally got locked inside and now it's become an aging asset inside [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=362.44s)]
*  stores across the country. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=368.4s)]
*  You know, the country shut down and people aren't buying stuff. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=370.2s)]
*  After months long closures beginning in March of 2020, Macy's posted over $900 million in [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=373.44s)]
*  losses for the first three quarters of 2020. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=379.44s)]
*  Despite this, it was in a better position to survive than many of its peers. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=382.68s)]
*  The lessons they learned from their leveraged buyout in the 80s really stayed with them. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=387.0s)]
*  And, you know, for a retailer to take on too much debt is very perilous. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=391.48s)]
*  This is what has pushed a lot of companies from JCPenney to Neiman Marcus to J. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=395.48s)]
*  Crew into bankruptcy. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=400.0s)]
*  To avoid debt, the retailer already had plans before the pandemic to close a fifth of its [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=401.2s)]
*  stores over the next three years. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=406.44s)]
*  And on top of that, in June, it said it planned to lay off nearly 4,000 corporate staffers. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=408.68s)]
*  A Macy's spokesperson says that by reorganizing how the company's structured and reducing [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=414.72s)]
*  costs, it's in a good position to win with customers and emerge a stronger company. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=419.20000000000005s)]
*  Not all the stores look great. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=424.56s)]
*  I mean, they've got maybe half their fleet they've been investing in and upgrading and [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=426.36s)]
*  making, you know, into kind of marquee locations. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  Macy's has to find a reason to exist. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=434.6s)]
*  Why should customers come to its stores when they can get so many of the products it sells [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=438.16s)]
*  elsewhere and sometimes for lower prices? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=443.24s)]
*  One positive for Macy's, as its competitors fold, the company has a chance to pick up [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=446.56s)]
*  market share. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=451.4s)]
*  Most stores have reopened and it's still got the annual marketing bonanza that is the Macy's [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=452.76s)]
*  Thanksgiving Day Parade. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=458.44s)]
*  Though in 2020, it will be a television only event without the in-person crowds. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0I6ncltaM&t=460.32s)]
