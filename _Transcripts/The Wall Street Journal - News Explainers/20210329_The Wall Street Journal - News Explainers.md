# NASA Seeks Water on the Moon to Fuel Its Mission to Get Humans to Mars  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 29, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU)
*  Traffic to the moon is going to pick up this year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=0.0s)]
*  We think it would be very exciting to have a base on the moon. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=4.0s)]
*  Space transportation companies from SpaceX to Blue Origin are teaming up with NASA. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=8.0s)]
*  The moon also needs infrastructure. Let me show you something. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=13.0s)]
*  And they have their sights on a valuable resource. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=21.0s)]
*  Hundreds of millions of tons of water ice at the poles of the moon. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=24.0s)]
*  Some geological analysts say the market for space water will be worth $206 billion over the next 30 years. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=29.0s)]
*  Water is the oil of space. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=36.0s)]
*  This would allow rockets to move deeper into the cosmos and eventually go to Mars. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=38.0s)]
*  So how do NASA and its partner companies plan to do this? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=43.0s)]
*  First, you've got to understand that it takes a lot of fuel to go to space. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=49.0s)]
*  The moon rockets in the 1960s were mostly just giant fuel tanks. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=53.0s)]
*  Because all the fuel it ever needs has to be brought from the Earth. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=58.0s)]
*  George Sowers is a professor of space resources at Colorado School of Mines. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=63.0s)]
*  And he's been enlisted by NASA to research water ice mining technology. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=67.0s)]
*  The importance of having sources of fuel beyond Earth is due to what we call the tyranny of the rocket equation. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=72.0s)]
*  What the rocket equation shows is that as you increase the amount of velocity that you want, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=80.0s)]
*  the amount of propellant that you need to deliver that increases exponentially. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=85.0s)]
*  Turns out the fuel itself isn't expensive. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=90.0s)]
*  The cost of propellant is actually only about 0.3% of the cost of the rocket or of emission. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=93.0s)]
*  So emission costs $60 million. The cost of propellant is only $200,000. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=101.0s)]
*  What is expensive is the weight of the fuel, because you need a lot of it to break through Earth's gravitational grip into space. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=106.0s)]
*  Moving mass from Earth into space is really, really hard to do. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=113.0s)]
*  It requires big rockets, and harnessing that power is very expensive. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=117.0s)]
*  So one way to reduce the weight launched from Earth? Build a refueling station in space. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=123.0s)]
*  According to Sauer's projection, refueling in space cuts the cost of every mission by at least 10 to 20%. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=130.0s)]
*  Also, if you can refuel in space at least once, the rocket can travel farther and at greater velocity. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=137.0s)]
*  This concept is already an important part of SpaceX's Starship design. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=144.0s)]
*  It can get tankered to fill up its propellant tanks, and so it can depart from low Earth orbit with 1200 tons of propellant. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=149.0s)]
*  Your delta velocity is enough to transport 350 tons to the surface of the moon or Mars. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=158.0s)]
*  In practicing docking with the space station, SpaceX has also learned how to rendezvous and dock in orbit in a complex environment. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=164.0s)]
*  Because of SpaceX's experience, NASA has chosen it to help develop orbital refueling. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=175.0s)]
*  But to make refueling sustainable, the space agency is looking for alternatives to transporting fuel from Earth. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=180.0s)]
*  In space resources, we have to use them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=186.0s)]
*  Enter space water. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=189.0s)]
*  We were given a gift, this nearby body called the moon. There's water there. It's in the form of ice. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=191.0s)]
*  Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin team has a nearly $580 million contract from NASA to design and develop a lunar lander called the Blue Moon, which will deliver crew and cargo. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=197.0s)]
*  This lander will be powered by liquid hydrogen, today's most common rocket fuel. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=208.0s)]
*  Ultimately, we're going to be able to get hydrogen from that water on the moon and be able to refuel these vehicles on the surface of the moon and use them. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=213.0s)]
*  By running an electric current through the water, it can be split into hydrogen and oxygen. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=222.0s)]
*  When the two gases are combined, then ignited, they explode, generating energy, which then becomes propellant. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=227.0s)]
*  To exploit water on the moon, NASA has created a five-year plan with international and commercial partners to set up mining operations. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=234.0s)]
*  If it can be harvested and utilized, it's a game changer. It's a paradigm shift. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=242.0s)]
*  Thomas Zurbuchen is the head of science at NASA. He oversees the moon and Mars research programs. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=247.0s)]
*  Water is an integral part of all missions, just for sustaining life and also for fuel. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=252.0s)]
*  So starting this year, two commercial landers will arrive on the moon, delivering spectrometers to map the location of water in craters and measure its concentration. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=259.0s)]
*  Next year, we're flying the first attempt at a mining drill to the surface of the moon. It's called Prime 1. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=268.0s)]
*  We're going to either modify it if we learn something or, as a copy, we're going to also fly on Viper. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=275.0s)]
*  Viper is a rover built to explore the darker regions of the South Pole. It'll search for water ice and start drilling for samples. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=282.0s)]
*  By 2024, NASA expects its first lunar outpost, called the Gateway, will be under construction. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=289.0s)]
*  This will serve as a port for landers en route to the lunar surface and spacecraft headed to Mars and beyond. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=295.0s)]
*  So if things go as planned, by 2025, NASA can contract robotics companies to start mining and three years later, begin water production on the moon. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=301.0s)]
*  That surface ice is going to be the lowest cost and the easiest to get. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=310.0s)]
*  We can get at it by just heating it up and sublimating it into vapor and capturing that vapor. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=315.0s)]
*  As we go forward, there may be a time where such a fuel depot is absolutely critical for what we can do. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=321.0s)]
*  Like if we want to go down to the moon multiple times, you know, from the Gateway or from other locations, kind of being able to pick up fuel is an enabling part. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=331.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, there are other experiments to create propellant in space. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=342.0s)]
*  NASA's Perseverance rover that landed on Mars in February is testing a system to extract oxygen from the carbon dioxide rich atmosphere to eventually make propellant. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=346.0s)]
*  And a recent study by Purdue University confirms the presence of widespread ice beneath the surface of Mars Arcadia Plains region, potentially a source for making fuel and supporting life. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=355.0s)]
*  While most scientists say a manned mission to Mars is still a decade away, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=366.0s)]
*  For now, practicing how to use space resources will be one of many key steps for humans to eventually set foot on another planet. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1bVYQUJeoU&t=370.0s)]
