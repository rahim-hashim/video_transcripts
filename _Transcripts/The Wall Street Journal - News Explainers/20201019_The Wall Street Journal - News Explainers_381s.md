# The Stock Market Is Ignoring the Economy. Here's Why | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 19, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc)
*  The stock market is back up after falling off a cliff earlier this year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, we've had these furious rallies. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=4.68s)]
*  Investors continue to put their money into our stock market. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  You're seeing new record highs on the S&P and NASDAQ. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Major indexes haven't just recovered from the coronavirus shock. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=13.32s)]
*  They're on a historic winning streak. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=16.76s)]
*  But while stocks climbed, millions lost their jobs and fell out of the labor force. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=19.12s)]
*  Companies say more layoffs could come this fall. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=23.96s)]
*  This means that the wealthiest Americans are netting huge returns, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=27.16s)]
*  while the poorest are losing opportunities to make money. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=30.6s)]
*  I think the question on everyone's mind has been, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=33.4s)]
*  how is the economy so bad while the stock market is soaring higher and higher? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  To get a sense for the disconnect, you can look at the labor market. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  We still have 11 million people out of the 22 million who were laid off [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=48.16s)]
*  in the payroll numbers in March and April. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  Still 11 million out there. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=56.68s)]
*  And that's really good progress. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=58.28s)]
*  We've put fully half of those back to work, but that's a long way to go. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=59.88s)]
*  Our economy had come to a standstill during the pandemic. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=64.48s)]
*  Americans are getting laid off. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  They're making less money. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=70.36s)]
*  They're spending less money. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=71.4s)]
*  And all of that hurts our economy. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=72.56s)]
*  About half of the workers in the leisure and hospitality industry [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=74.84s)]
*  lost their jobs this summer. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  Casinos, airports and music venues sat virtually empty. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=79.92s)]
*  That's weighing on consumer spending. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=83.6s)]
*  It plummeted in March and still hasn't reached pre-pandemic levels. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=85.64s)]
*  Experts say that this is unlikely to change until the virus is contained. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  That means businesses are making fewer sales and hiring fewer people. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=94.36s)]
*  There were 10.7 million fewer U.S. jobs in September versus February. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=98.32s)]
*  That will make it more difficult for the unemployed to find work. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  Despite a crumbling economy, the stock market has soared. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  And there are a few forces driving that rally. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=111.6s)]
*  Most notable were the policies coming out of America's central bank. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=114.6s)]
*  We acted forcefully to get our markets working again. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=118.83999999999999s)]
*  And as a result, market conditions have generally improved. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=121.6s)]
*  In March, the Fed made emergency loans available to banks, local governments [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=125.32s)]
*  and other players in the global economy. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=129.44s)]
*  That kept investors optimistic about the future. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=131.95999999999998s)]
*  And that can drive up the markets. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=134.56s)]
*  Investors said the Fed stepped in like they'd never had before. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=136.68s)]
*  Their response was quicker and more muscular than ever before. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=140.44s)]
*  And that was a key driver for the stock market this spring. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=144.72s)]
*  The bank started by slashing interest rates to near zero, which made it cheaper to borrow money. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=148.72s)]
*  Then the bank started to buy debt. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=154.72s)]
*  By September, the Fed controlled $7 trillion worth of assets, up from $4 trillion at the beginning of the pandemic. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=156.96s)]
*  Overcoming months, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=164.08s)]
*  and agency mortgage-backed securities, at least at the current pace. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=168.52s)]
*  These asset purchases are intended to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=172.44s)]
*  The bank's purchasing has sent yields on traditionally safe government debt to near all-time lows. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  That's driving investors toward stocks. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=185.4s)]
*  Treasuries all of a sudden don't look as attractive because the yield on them is so low. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=187.36s)]
*  So if you want returns, you might as well go to stocks. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=193.0s)]
*  And that's kind of the calculus that a lot of investors have been doing. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=196.56s)]
*  And it's actually, people call it the Quora Quotina effect. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=199.76s)]
*  There is no alternative to stocks because yields are just so low. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=202.56s)]
*  Where else are you going to go for returns? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=206.24s)]
*  This and other actions from the Fed propped up the markets. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=208.44s)]
*  And the money that flowed from these policies went into one section of the market in particular, technology. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=211.72s)]
*  Tech stocks lifted entire market indexes this year. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=218.4s)]
*  You can see that by comparing the tech-heavy NASDAQ and S&P indices to the performance of the Dow Jones industrial average. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  It's easy to think like, wow, stocks are doing so well. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  But what we've seen this year is that it's really a handful of stocks that are doing really well. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=232.44s)]
*  And those are mainly technology companies. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=237.64s)]
*  Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=239.92s)]
*  These big names offer products that were crucial to live life and conduct business in the pandemic. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=243.48s)]
*  And their leaders took note on earnings calls this summer. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  This was a strong quarter for us, especially compared to what we expected at the start. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=251.84s)]
*  We began to see a significant increase in customer demand beginning in early March. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=256.44s)]
*  In an uncertain environment, Apple saw a quarter of historic results. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=260.72s)]
*  Investors expect solid earnings from these companies, which will boost demand for their stock. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=265.6s)]
*  You really can't overstate how well these tech companies have done this year. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=270.52s)]
*  And what a big role that plays in driving the S&P 500 up higher. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=274.32s)]
*  Apple loan recently was worth more than all of the stocks in the FTSE 100 index or all of the companies in the Russell 2000 index of small stocks. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=279.2s)]
*  Tech stocks are doing so well that their gains are outweighing losses in financial companies and energy stocks, which haven't been able to rally. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=290.08s)]
*  Smaller businesses are hurting, too. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=297.12s)]
*  Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Holdings said that if there were a stock market index of private small businesses, it would likely be down 50 percent or more. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=299.44s)]
*  While investors lock in expectations for earnings and tech, a flood of action from individual investors is also changing the markets. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=309.28s)]
*  You're seeing newbie investors who had never traded before. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=316.32s)]
*  They were stuck at home during the pandemic and they opened up brokerage accounts because it's never been easier to trade. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  It's never been easier to open an account. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  Digital brokers like Robinhood offer commission free trading, which has drawn more investors into the market. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=326.4s)]
*  During the first six months of the year, individual investors made up about 20 percent of market activity. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=332.08s)]
*  That's about a five percentage point jump from last year. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=337.36s)]
*  Analysts said smaller investors drove up stocks like Nikola and Eastman Kodak, but they don't impact bigger names like Apple and Tesla. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=340.64s)]
*  Brokers are making markets more accessible, but that's not helping the bottom half of American workers. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=349.52s)]
*  Workers from lower income households were more likely to lose their jobs in the pandemic, and many in this group have historically been shut out of the stock market. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=355.24s)]
*  Most stocks are held by the top 10 percent of Americans by wealth, according to data from the Federal Reserve. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=363.88s)]
*  Charts like this sum up why a booming stock market seems disconnected from the economic reality for many Americans. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFJj4E1G2Qc&t=369.96s)]
