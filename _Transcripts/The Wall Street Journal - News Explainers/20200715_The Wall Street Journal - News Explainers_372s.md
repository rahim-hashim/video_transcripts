# How Coronavirus Spread Across the U.S. | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 15, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI)
*  In mid-January, a hospital in Everett, Washington, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=0.0s)]
*  announced a patient had tested positive [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=3.5s)]
*  for a deadly new strain of coronavirus, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=5.72s)]
*  the cause of the yet-to-be-named disease, COVID-19. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=8.4s)]
*  It was the first reported case in the United States. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=11.9s)]
*  Concerning, but still a relatively small threat [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=15.22s)]
*  compared to the growing outbreak in China. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=18.06s)]
*  But fast forward six months, and the United States [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=20.5s)]
*  has the most recorded coronavirus cases in the world. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=23.32s)]
*  So how did it spread in the United States? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=26.92s)]
*  Looking back, public health experts have pointed [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=30.28s)]
*  to a series of missteps and miscalculations [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=32.92s)]
*  in the US response. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=35.6s)]
*  A response that has been polarizing and painful, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=37.32s)]
*  and launched the country into a deadly game of catch-up [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=40.38s)]
*  with a pandemic that has yet to subside. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  The first major action the United States takes [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=48.58s)]
*  against coronavirus is to restrict travelers [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=51.160000000000004s)]
*  coming from China. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=53.88s)]
*  The first case in Everett, Washington, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=55.46s)]
*  and a second case in Chicago, both were from travelers [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=57.300000000000004s)]
*  who had recently returned from the Chinese province [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=60.42s)]
*  at the heart of the outbreak. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=62.94s)]
*  But the virus was also circulating in Europe [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=64.82s)]
*  around this time, a second front of infiltration [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=67.7s)]
*  that will go overlooked for several weeks. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=70.86s)]
*  In early February, US efforts center on how to safely screen [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=73.94s)]
*  and repatriate Americans returning from Asia, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=78.28s)]
*  like those quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise liner [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=81.64s)]
*  in Japan. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=84.62s)]
*  This outbreak is the largest outside of mainland China, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=85.78s)]
*  and shows how rapidly the virus can spread [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=89.02000000000001s)]
*  if left unchecked. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=91.7s)]
*  Public health experts say that a widespread deployment [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=93.62s)]
*  of testing in the US is essential for containment. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=96.18s)]
*  But test kits sent by the CDC to public health labs [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=99.5s)]
*  across the country proved to be faulty, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=102.5s)]
*  and the labs are told they shouldn't use them. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=104.7s)]
*  The FDA bars independent labs from using tests [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=107.30000000000001s)]
*  they've developed themselves, and health officials say [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=110.30000000000001s)]
*  the public should not wear masks. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=112.74s)]
*  As the virus silently spreads across the country, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=114.74s)]
*  experts warn of a testing bottleneck [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=117.61999999999999s)]
*  that can't keep up with demand, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=119.58s)]
*  despite the president's reassurances. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=121.3s)]
*  Anybody that wants a test can get a test. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=123.94s)]
*  That's what the bottleneck is. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=126.5s)]
*  As the CDC expands the criteria for who can be tested, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=129.1s)]
*  infection hotspots appear across the country. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=132.98s)]
*  One emerges in New Rochelle, New York. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=136.06s)]
*  The National Guard is deployed to establish [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=139.14s)]
*  a one-square-mile quarantine zone [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=141.02s)]
*  within the New York City suburb. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=142.98000000000002s)]
*  But by that point, patients and their family members [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=145.58s)]
*  had already traveled to several locations [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=148.22s)]
*  throughout the metro area, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  including a synagogue and a school. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=151.9s)]
*  The nation's top infectious disease expert tells Congress [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  the country's testing strategy isn't working. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=158.26000000000002s)]
*  The system is not really geared to what we need right now, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=161.3s)]
*  what you are asking for. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=167.78s)]
*  That is a failing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=169.7s)]
*  In mid-March, the coronavirus outbreak [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  is declared a national emergency, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=173.78s)]
*  as the country comes to grips with the fact [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=175.98s)]
*  that the lack of testing [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=178.06s)]
*  has made containment more difficult. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=179.26s)]
*  Shortly after, six Bay Area counties enact [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=181.73999999999998s)]
*  the first stay-at-home orders in the country, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=184.66s)]
*  closing all nonessential businesses. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=187.33999999999997s)]
*  The entire state of California soon follows, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=189.54s)]
*  preceding a cascade of 42 state closures [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=192.06s)]
*  over the next three weeks. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=194.98s)]
*  After initially saying people shouldn't wear masks, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=197.66s)]
*  the CDC reverses course in early April, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=200.02s)]
*  recommending they be worn in public, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=202.66s)]
*  guidance that is highly politicized [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=204.86s)]
*  as Americans become split on the severity of the outbreak. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=206.74s)]
*  The perils of the virus are on full display [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=210.9s)]
*  at the outbreak's epicenter in New York City. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  ICUs are overwhelmed as officials try to rapidly [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=215.9s)]
*  increase hospital capacity to treat patients [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=218.9s)]
*  and confront the mounting number of deaths. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=221.62s)]
*  I'm tired of walking into rooms and your patients are dead. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=224.3s)]
*  You just walk into a room and there's a dead body there. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=231.66000000000003s)]
*  I'm tired of calling families and telling them that news. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=234.9s)]
*  In less hard-hit areas, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=239.26000000000002s)]
*  Americans protest stay-at-home orders, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=240.86s)]
*  often without masks, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=243.22000000000003s)]
*  to compel governors to reopen their economies. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  By the end of May, economic pressures have driven [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=248.62s)]
*  every state to ease lockdowns, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=251.06s)]
*  despite health experts saying only three states [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=252.94s)]
*  meet reopening guidelines set by the Trump administration. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=255.54s)]
*  These guidelines call for extensive testing and contact tracing, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=258.9s)]
*  but states have a tough time implementing these measures [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=262.54s)]
*  for a few reasons. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=265.46s)]
*  First, testing still isn't widely available. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=266.74s)]
*  One analysis in late May concludes that 53% of US counties [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=270.38s)]
*  don't have a testing site, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=274.18s)]
*  and this lack of testing disproportionately impacts [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=276.62s)]
*  minority communities. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=279.62s)]
*  Second, reopening states don't have the resources [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=281.66s)]
*  to trace infections. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=284.54s)]
*  A recent analysis finds that Florida's Department of Health [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=286.06s)]
*  needs 33,000 contact tracers. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=289.18s)]
*  The state currently has just over 2,300. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=291.7s)]
*  Officials warn that bars, restaurants, and summer gatherings [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=294.78000000000003s)]
*  are ground zero for infections, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=298.26s)]
*  as asymptomatic young people drive a surge in new cases. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=300.3s)]
*  Protesters demonstrate against police violence [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=304.18s)]
*  and institutionalized racism, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=306.58s)]
*  as the virus continues to disproportionately affect [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=308.66s)]
*  minority communities. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=311.62s)]
*  And by the end of June, the epicenter of the outbreak [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=313.38s)]
*  shifts to the South and West, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=315.82s)]
*  as cases spike in Florida, Texas, Arizona, and California, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=318.06s)]
*  and forces some states to roll back or slow down reopenings. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=321.9s)]
*  We are now having 40-plus thousand new cases a day. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=325.58s)]
*  I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a day [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=330.42s)]
*  if this does not turn around, and so I am very concerned. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=334.46s)]
*  By mid-July, 13 states see new infections rise by over 20% [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=338.74s)]
*  compared to the previous week, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=343.38s)]
*  and Florida sets a new single-day record [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=345.34000000000003s)]
*  of over 15,000 new cases, as the country debates [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=347.42s)]
*  whether schools should reopen in the fall. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=350.82s)]
*  The coronavirus outbreak in the United States [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=353.54s)]
*  has proven difficult to manage, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=355.9s)]
*  and so it's difficult to predict what will happen next. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=358.46s)]
*  But public health experts say learning from the costly [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=361.98s)]
*  mistakes of the past six months may be crucial [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=364.66s)]
*  in plotting a path forward. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkzNElJ1pSI&t=367.5s)]
