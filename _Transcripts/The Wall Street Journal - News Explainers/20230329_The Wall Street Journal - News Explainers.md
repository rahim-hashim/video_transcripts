# Why Israelis Are Protesting Netanyahu’s Judicial Reforms  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk)
*  From blocking highways, deforming human chains, and dressing up as characters from Margaret [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=0.0s)]
*  Atwood's dystopian novel, The Handmaid's Tale, for three months, up to half a million [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=10.36s)]
*  Israelis have taken to the streets across the country to protest a judicial overhaul [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=15.94s)]
*  planned by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=19.88s)]
*  The growing revolt piled pressure on Netanyahu to suspend the overhaul until Parliament reconvenes [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=22.56s)]
*  at the end of April. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=27.34s)]
*  When there is a possibility to prevent a brotherly war of independence, I, as Prime Minister, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=28.74s)]
*  take a moment of independence. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=34.62s)]
*  Here's what's happening in Israel, the stakes behind Netanyahu's judicial overhaul, and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=36.82s)]
*  where things can be headed next. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=41.5s)]
*  There are many layers to it, but there are three things you need to understand. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=45.42s)]
*  First is changing the committee that appoints judges. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=48.58s)]
*  This overhaul will give the ruling coalition a majority on that committee, and that will [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=51.86s)]
*  allow them to place like-minded judges on the bench. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=56.86s)]
*  The second pillar of the judicial overhaul is to limit the jurisdiction of the court. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=61.38s)]
*  That means what cases will the court be able to hear? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=65.58s)]
*  And the third thing, and perhaps the most controversial bit, is what's called the override [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=68.9s)]
*  clause. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=73.14s)]
*  That will allow a simple majority of Parliament, meaning 61 of 120 lawmakers, to override decisions [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=74.14s)]
*  of the Supreme Court. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=81.02s)]
*  Netanyahu and his coalition partners say this judicial overhaul is necessary in order to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=82.5s)]
*  balance out the court. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=86.7s)]
*  They say that the court is dominated by liberals, and that it's way too activist. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=88.18s)]
*  The court itself needs to check on its power because it is essentially blocking the will [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=92.06s)]
*  of the people. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=97.38s)]
*  For people who oppose the overhaul, they believe it will undermine the Supreme Court completely. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=98.58s)]
*  We came here to protest against the degradation of the Israeli democracy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=102.66s)]
*  We see a process where the rights of the people will be over time consumed by this theocratic [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=107.82000000000001s)]
*  government. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=115.38s)]
*  These protests have really exposed long-held divisions in Israeli society between its secular [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=116.78s)]
*  side and its religious, more conservative side. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=121.74s)]
*  One of the major problems of this overhaul for the protesters is that it's being advanced [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=126.78s)]
*  by Prime Minister Netanyahu himself. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=132.34s)]
*  Netanyahu has long been a defender of the court, and they ask themselves why is Netanyahu [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=134.3s)]
*  suddenly supporting this massive judicial overhaul? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=139.42s)]
*  And for them the answer is clear. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=142.5s)]
*  It's because Benjamin Netanyahu is on trial for corruption. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=144.38s)]
*  And if this overhaul passes, they believe he will use it in order to get out of his [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=148.22s)]
*  own legal problems. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=152.14s)]
*  Netanyahu denies this, but the protesters at this point simply do not believe him. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=153.58s)]
*  After Netanyahu has paused legislation, it will be very, very difficult for the opposition [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  and the ruling coalition to find an agreement on this issue because they are so far apart [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=167.14s)]
*  as it stands. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=171.66s)]
*  Perhaps the opposition and the coalition will find a compromise, but if they don't, we [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=172.66s)]
*  can expect this conflict to come back and to come back strong. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R7vVsdQ5Pk&t=177.46s)]
