# Twitter vs. Facebook The Evolving Moderation of the President  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M)
*  Twitter took unprecedented action recently on two tweets from President Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=0.0s)]
*  The first was adding a fact check notification to a tweet about mail-in voting. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=6.78s)]
*  And the second was to place a warning in front of a tweet that insinuated looters would be [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=11.56s)]
*  shot amidst the protests over the death of George Floyd, that the platform said violated [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=15.46s)]
*  its policies about glorifying violence. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=20.42s)]
*  The fact check of the first tweet sparked ire from the president. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=23.52s)]
*  That was only increased by the warning label placed on the second tweet. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=27.5s)]
*  While Twitter has intervened into the president's posts, Facebook hasn't. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=32.78s)]
*  Both messages appeared unaltered on the president's Facebook page. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=36.94s)]
*  We have a different policy, I think, than Twitter on this. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=40.9s)]
*  You know, I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=43.9s)]
*  that people say online. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=51.0s)]
*  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has said the platform will continue to fact check information about [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=53.18s)]
*  elections. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=57.94s)]
*  But how did Facebook and Twitter come to take different views on moderating the president [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=58.94s)]
*  on their platforms? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=63.06s)]
*  It's the latest question in an ongoing debate about the responsibility tech companies have [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=64.06s)]
*  in policing speech online. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=68.86s)]
*  You can think of online content moderation a bit like book publishing. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=70.62s)]
*  If a book with objectionable content like hate speech was written, the publisher would [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=75.74s)]
*  be responsible for editing that stuff out before it's shipped to bookstores. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=80.14s)]
*  If that stuff somehow made it into the book and that book somehow made it onto shelves, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=84.3s)]
*  the bookstore couldn't be held responsible for what was in the book, since it had no [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=89.1s)]
*  say in its creation. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=92.74s)]
*  Unlike say a newspaper or a traditional publisher, the platforms operate completely differently [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=94.5s)]
*  with the idea that they're sort of providing the place to put this stuff for individuals [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=99.7s)]
*  to publish themselves. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=105.58s)]
*  In the 1990s, many early online forums like CompuServe chose to not actively moderate [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=107.14s)]
*  content on their sites, while other sites like Prodigy did. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=112.34s)]
*  A series of court rulings determined that sites that actively moderated their content [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=116.5s)]
*  were more like publishers, and therefore could be held liable for defamatory content. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=120.7s)]
*  And this was viewed as kind of being a thing that was just going to greatly sort of slow [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=125.5s)]
*  down the development of the internet in general and really sort of threaten the ability to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  build a functional ecosystem. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=136.06s)]
*  To address this issue, Congress included a provision in the 1996 Communications Decency [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=138.26s)]
*  Act called Section 230. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=143.34s)]
*  So Section 230 allowed them to be focused on being platforms and not on being publishers. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=145.66s)]
*  They could intervene when they wanted to for the good of their platform, but they didn't [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  have any responsibility beyond sort of making sure that they weren't becoming sort of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=156.82s)]
*  an obsessed pool of illegal behavior. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=162.46s)]
*  But this prioritization of growth over moderation came with consequences. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=164.74s)]
*  In 2016, social media disinformation campaigns during the election put pressure on Facebook [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=169.3s)]
*  and Twitter to step up their moderation efforts. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=176.26000000000002s)]
*  We were too slow to spot this and too slow to act. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=179.34s)]
*  Propaganda through bots and human coordination, misinformation campaigns, and divisive filter [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=183.34s)]
*  bubbles. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=189.86s)]
*  That's not a healthy public square. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=190.86s)]
*  There was a sense that this was getting to be pre-lawless and also that these ecosystems [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=193.66s)]
*  were extremely vulnerable to manipulation. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=198.5s)]
*  Facebook and Twitter both rolled out fact-checking operations to combat misinformation. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=201.5s)]
*  Facebook's had sort of an independent fact-checking program. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=206.42s)]
*  Twitter's done a bit more stuff internally. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=209.62s)]
*  But the general idea is that neither of the platforms want to do much regulation of speech, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=211.62s)]
*  particularly when it comes to things like censoring the president of the United States. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=219.22s)]
*  But both internally and externally, tech companies have faced mounting pressure to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=223.62s)]
*  confront what the president posts on their platforms. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=227.94s)]
*  None more so than Twitter. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  Trump has been a very aggressive user of Twitter. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=232.38s)]
*  It's kind of his native medium. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=235.46s)]
*  And Twitter recently kind of took a step. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=237.46s)]
*  Twitter's decision to add its fact-check label to the president's May 26 tweet was [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=241.66s)]
*  the first time the platform had fact-check information outside of the coronavirus pandemic. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=246.26s)]
*  Two days after the tweet, the president signed an executive order seeking to limit the broad [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=251.34s)]
*  legal protections tech companies have under Section 230. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=255.82s)]
*  Currently, social media giants like Twitter receive an unprecedented liability shield [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=259.54s)]
*  based on the theory that they're a neutral platform, which they are not. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=265.1s)]
*  Section 230 doesn't have anything to do with political bias. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=269.98s)]
*  In fact, the whole point of 230 was to allow them to intervene without fear of legal repercussion. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=273.3s)]
*  So this isn't kind of something that is a natural outgrowth of the law. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=281.1s)]
*  The morning after the executive order was signed, Twitter placed the warning message [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=285.34000000000003s)]
*  on the president's tweet about looters, while Facebook let the post appear unaltered. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=289.14000000000004s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg said that while he personally had a visceral negative reaction to the post, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=293.86s)]
*  it didn't violate Facebook's policies. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=298.42s)]
*  When Twitter sort of stepped into this thing, Facebook ducked. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=301.54s)]
*  Facebook has for years tried to stay out of regulating political speech, in particular [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=304.94s)]
*  They have sort of resisted calls from what might have been natural allies to restrict this stuff. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=311.46s)]
*  Twitter has also applied another warning label in front of a tweet by Congressman Matt Gaetz, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=318.9s)]
*  saying it also glorified violence. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=323.66s)]
*  Twitter does seem to be making a decision that there are some limits it wants to put within U.S. politics. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=325.78s)]
*  And that's something that has been kind of a third rail for American technology companies. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=333.42s)]
*  Zuckerberg said Facebook will review existing policies on how it handles content related to civil unrest or violence. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=339.66s)]
*  Where exactly the president's order and attempts at legal restrictions on the platforms and on their moderation go is unclear. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=347.18s)]
*  This certainly seems like it's going to draw them deeper into politics. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=357.34000000000003s)]
*  And that's something that Mark Zuckerberg, I think, has been desperately trying to avoid. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGLc4nNT0M&t=360.34000000000003s)]
