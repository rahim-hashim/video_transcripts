# North Korea's New Push to Export Its Propaganda | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 02, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk)
*  This is probably what comes to mind when you think about North Korean propaganda. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=0.0s)]
*  A hawkish newscast about the country's battle with the U.S. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=7.0s)]
*  Or videos with triumphant music of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un inspecting missiles. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=14.84s)]
*  But recently, the country has been putting out something different. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=19.92s)]
*  Hello my dear friends. I wish this beautiful April day could cheer you up a little bit. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=24.72s)]
*  This is Eunha. She doesn't share much about herself but shows viewers the softer side of life in Pyongyang. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=30.4s)]
*  From where to get her favorite snacks, to what she does for fun, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=36.56s)]
*  and where to go running. It's my favorite day of the week, you know? It's my day off. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  She speaks to her viewers in English, though some videos from her channel are subtitled in [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Chinese while others in French, all in an effort to target an international audience. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=54.0s)]
*  They need to do something to kind of counter this image of them just being trouble makers [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=59.52s)]
*  that want to start wars. It's not talking down to the viewer. Today is kind of a special day for [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=64.24s)]
*  students. To sort of give you this feel that you're getting something that's very real. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=69.12s)]
*  This is really aimed at public opinion and public opinion can shift political policy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=73.28s)]
*  While it's difficult to independently verify what's going on inside the country and North [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=79.28s)]
*  Korean officials didn't respond to our request for comment, outsiders who study the regime's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=83.44s)]
*  media say the leadership is trying to rebrand its international image. We have become one of the very [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=88.16s)]
*  few COVID-free countries worldwide. And revamping its propaganda machine could sway how outsiders [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=94.08s)]
*  view the country's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. It's very different from anything we've [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  seen before. Martin Williams is a researcher with the nonprofit organization 38 North, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=108.32s)]
*  and he's been watching how North Korea's broadcasting has evolved over two decades. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=114.0s)]
*  One of the country's early forays into tapping an international audience was in the late 2000s [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  with the YouTube channel for state media broadcasts. It's completely impossible for [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=124.32s)]
*  anyone in North Korea to just sort of start a channel and upload these videos without there [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=130.0s)]
*  being official approval for it. In the last couple of years, other accounts have emerged on [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=134.8s)]
*  the internet. And Una's videos are not staged like the broadcast created by North Korean state media. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=139.60000000000002s)]
*  She doesn't sit behind an anchor desk and is often outside. Some of the videos even include blooper [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  moments. North Korea seems to be slowly evolving in the way that it's trying to tell its story to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  the world. We're 20 years into the 21st century, but I think this is the first 21st century style [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  propaganda that North Korea's tried for the international audience. Though it couldn't be [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=164.4s)]
*  determined who's exactly behind these channels, Echo of Truth and New DPRK are now drawing more [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  than 37,000 followers. On Chinese social media platform Weibo, the New DPRK account has more [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=175.12s)]
*  than half a million followers. Analysts say this evolution of North Korean propaganda is probably [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=181.6s)]
*  inspired by China. In the next 20 days, we'll take a grand road trip. Which also tightly [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=188.24s)]
*  controls its media to sway opinion at home and abroad. We're also learning Tangcast [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=194.4s)]
*  girl painting, horseback riding, knife making and dancing. They are taking a page from China's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=198.96s)]
*  propaganda network. It's a little bit easier for them to look at Chinese social networks and see [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=204.0s)]
*  what's popular and kind of take that as ideas. Among the several dozen videos uploaded this year, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=209.12s)]
*  one theme has come up frequently. The big news is the last thing we need in such fierce battle [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=214.88s)]
*  time with COVID-19. These videos debunk what outsiders have said about North Korea's handling [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=220.56s)]
*  of the coronavirus outbreak. A World Food Program report from April placed North Korea on a list of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=225.92s)]
*  countries at risk of food shortages because of the pandemic. A few days later, Una took viewers to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=231.92s)]
*  a supermarket in Pyongyang. As you can see, all the shops are fully stocked with products and food [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=237.44s)]
*  to satisfy people's demand. North Korea's economy was already hit by sanctions, and economists say [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=242.72s)]
*  the pandemic will likely hurt growth this year. Recently, a Western media reported about if DPRK's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=248.48s)]
*  economy... So I'm here today to check it out. Una asked shoppers if everyday items are getting too [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  expensive. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=261.68s)]
*  Traditionally, North Korea hasn't directly responded to much press coverage and much international [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=262.16s)]
*  criticism. What we've seen on these YouTube channels is they're trying to put a little bit of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=276.48s)]
*  doubt into your mind, but you know, maybe everything you see on North Korea isn't quite true. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=280.88s)]
*  North Korean authorities have also repeatedly claimed the country has had zero coronavirus [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=286.8s)]
*  infections, though state media reported one apparent case that was imported by a defector [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=291.52s)]
*  who had returned in July. Foreign media and North Korea watchers have been skeptical about the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=296.24s)]
*  claim. There's a lot of suspicion that COVID has already been present in North Korea for many [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  months now. In this video from March, Una explained the regime's secrets to stopping the virus. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=307.44s)]
*  The message from North Korea was that this sort of well-running society that they have and this [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  efficient government they have. An efficient health system that's able to maintain hygiene levels, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=322.56s)]
*  which other countries weren't able to do. It's hard to tell how effectively North Korea's new [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=332.88s)]
*  propaganda will sway foreigners, but Una's YouTube channel is already getting many more views than [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=339.68s)]
*  another one of the regime's state media accounts that was set up around the same time in 2017. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=345.12s)]
*  I think if the audience continues growing, I think the next thing you'll see is North Korea putting a [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=350.64s)]
*  bit more money into some of these videos and they're going to continue trying to refine it, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=355.68s)]
*  because it's the same as any propaganda. It's all about international public image. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=359.6s)]
*  The nation, the land, the freedom that I can call my life. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a__Bgo3bk&t=364.0s)]
