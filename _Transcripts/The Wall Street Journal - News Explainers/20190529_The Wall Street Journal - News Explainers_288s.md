# Netflix's Hollywood Rivals Are Spoiling for a Fight | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 29, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU)
*  With 149 million customers worldwide, it's no secret that Netflix is the world champion [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=0.0s)]
*  of streaming video. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=6.66s)]
*  But new competitors are entering the ring. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=8.16s)]
*  Among them, Comcast, AT&T, and Disney. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=11.44s)]
*  Now, those traditional media giants are gearing up to launch subscription streaming services [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=15.44s)]
*  of their own, entering a crowded field alongside Amazon, Hulu, Apple, and others. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=20.22s)]
*  They're ready to duke it out for who will distribute your favorite movies and TV shows. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=26.82s)]
*  I say, bring it on. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=31.82s)]
*  Netflix is no ordinary foe. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=33.9s)]
*  It spends $12 billion a year on content, and it's a magnet for top Hollywood producers [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=36.14s)]
*  and actors. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=41.18s)]
*  But most importantly, it has a head start of more than a decade. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=42.9s)]
*  But the three new entrants have a secret weapon, TV brands and movie franchises people know [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  and love. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=52.5s)]
*  They've licensed a lot of their classic programming to Netflix over the years. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=53.86s)]
*  But now, they'll want to bring their hits back to their own services. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=58.66s)]
*  And that could pose a challenge to Netflix. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=62.379999999999995s)]
*  First up, Comcast. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=69.86s)]
*  Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal has plans to launch an ad-supported streaming service by 2020. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=72.06s)]
*  You need to play to win. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=78.42s)]
*  But you also have to win to play. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=81.58s)]
*  The company hasn't said much about what will be on the service, but viewers can expect [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=88.38s)]
*  lots of content from their film and TV franchises. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=92.34s)]
*  Executives are already contemplating bringing back The Office, Netflix's most watched show, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=96.62s)]
*  since the contract expires in 2021. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=101.66s)]
*  Parks and Recreation is another show Comcast might want to fight for. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=104.62s)]
*  An ad-supported service will be available to around 54 million customers that already [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=109.38s)]
*  subscribe to Comcast cable in Sky and other cable providers that offer NBC channels. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  And those without traditional paid TV packages will be able to subscribe for a monthly fee. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=120.5s)]
*  But to be competitive, Comcast may also need to pump some cash into original programming. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=125.89999999999999s)]
*  But will that be enough to challenge Netflix? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=131.26s)]
*  The next challenger, AT&T's WarnerMedia. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=136.58s)]
*  AT&T's recent acquisition of Time Warner, now WarnerMedia, means the company has balked [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=139.98000000000002s)]
*  up into a major producer of film and television content, home to the Warner Bros. studio and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=145.78s)]
*  HBO. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=151.9s)]
*  With movies like The Dark Knight and shows like Game of Thrones in their corner, they [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=152.9s)]
*  could prove to be a major contender in the streaming ring. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=156.98000000000002s)]
*  WarnerMedia, whose service is expected to launch late this year, is planning for a three-tiered [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=160.66000000000003s)]
*  approach to streaming. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=165.14s)]
*  There will be an entry-level plan focused on movies, a second tier with original programming [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=167.42s)]
*  and blockbuster films, and a bundle of content from the first two, plus popular content from [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=172.01999999999998s)]
*  the Warner Bros. library. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=177.42s)]
*  WarnerMedia chose to keep licensing reruns of Friends to Netflix through 2019, but Warner [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=180.17999999999998s)]
*  has the right to take the show back once it launches the new service. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=186.01999999999998s)]
*  Nothing's set in stone in the makeup of these streaming tiers, so WarnerMedia could [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  always choose to pivot before launch. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=194.1s)]
*  The last challenger? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=202.1s)]
*  Disney. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=203.74s)]
*  Before long, Disney will be operating three separate video streaming services, Hulu, ESPN [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  Plus and a new streaming service called Disney Plus, set to launch in November 2019. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=210.82s)]
*  The company said it plans to price the new Disney Plus service at $6.99 a month, almost [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=216.98s)]
*  half the cost of a Netflix subscription. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=223.02s)]
*  Rockwell likes a good fight. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=225.02s)]
*  Disney Plus will be anchored by programming from Disney's biggest franchises, including [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=227.54s)]
*  Star Wars, Marvel Studios and original programming. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=231.82s)]
*  And Disney brought in other big titles like The Simpsons from its $71 billion acquisition [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=235.76s)]
*  of 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=241.06s)]
*  Now, family, put on the mouse ears. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=243.9s)]
*  You only get one chance to make a first impression. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=247.02s)]
*  Now, Disney is aggressively removing its top programming from Netflix. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=251.46s)]
*  But that move means losing $150 million a year in operating income, which Disney hopes [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=255.78s)]
*  to recoup in subscription fees from Disney Plus. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=261.02s)]
*  The challengers will be working hard to get Netflix on the ropes. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  But a big challenge? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=268.82s)]
*  We'll be making up for the hundreds of millions of dollars lost from licensing programs to [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=270.14s)]
*  Netflix. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=274.74s)]
*  That means signing up lots of customers and keeping Wall Street happy. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=275.94s)]
*  Easier said than done. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueiI6f1p7GU&t=280.18s)]
