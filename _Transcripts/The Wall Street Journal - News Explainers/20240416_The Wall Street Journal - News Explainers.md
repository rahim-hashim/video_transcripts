Video Description: The U.S. is racing to secure its own lithium and nickel, which is used in battery production for products like EVs and other tech. Today, China produces more than 85% of the world’s batteries. So how is the U.S. pushing to mine battery metals needed for the energy transition and for national security?

WSJ takes an inside look at two projects that are seeking to change the mineral supply chain, the Thacker Pass Lithium Mine in Nevada and the Tamarack Mine in Minnesota.

**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ)
*  Along the Nevada-Oregon border sits the McDermott caldera, where, hidden in the clay, is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S.'s largest deposit of lithium. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=7.2s)]
*  And 1,700 miles away is the Tamarack Project, home to one of the country's only sources [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=10.8s)]
*  of high-grade nickel. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=17.18s)]
*  This is the highest-grade rock I've ever held in my career. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=18.84s)]
*  The U.S. is now investing billions to mine these battery minerals and build up enough [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  domestic supply to break its reliance on China, which currently dominates global battery production. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=25.8s)]
*  We can't build a future that's made in America if we ourselves are dependent on China for [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  the materials that power the products of today and tomorrow. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=37.52s)]
*  Here's how two projects are digging in despite the challenges, hoping to change the battery [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=41.72s)]
*  metal supply chain. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=46.84s)]
*  Right now, the supply chain for these minerals spans the globe. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  Australia mines 48 percent of the world's lithium, and Indonesia extracts 50 percent [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=53.2s)]
*  of global nickel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  Once mined, a majority of both are sent to China, along with other battery metals for [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  processing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=64.08s)]
*  Much of that material then remains there to be put into batteries. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=65.08s)]
*  Today, China produces more than 85 percent of the world's batteries. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=69.36s)]
*  Any nation wants to have control over its source of energy and control over its raw [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=74.28s)]
*  materials that go into national defense. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=81.68s)]
*  And right now, we're dependent on countries that potentially could be rivals. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=84.2s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  It's now law. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  2022's Inflation Reduction Act seeks to change that, with billions of dollars in subsidies [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  meant to bring all of this within U.S. borders, both for the energy transition and national [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=97.44s)]
*  security. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  The law includes a $7,500 tax credit for people who buy electric vehicles with batteries [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=105.2s)]
*  containing mineral source from these countries. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=110.32s)]
*  But not these. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=113.78s)]
*  Battery makers and automakers are now working hard to comply and to get more products to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=115.8s)]
*  qualify. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=122.64s)]
*  They're even taking their money straight to the source. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=123.64s)]
*  In General Motors' case, that's this 18,000-acre section of the McDermott caldera called Thacker [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=127.06s)]
*  Pass. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=132.95999999999998s)]
*  The ultimate product that comes out of there is 40,000 tons of lithium carbonate every [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=134.12s)]
*  year. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=139.04s)]
*  That's big enough to put into about a million General Motors electric vehicles every single [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=140.04s)]
*  year. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  The carmaker committed $650 million towards the Thacker Pass project last year, giving [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=146.68s)]
*  it exclusive rights to all of the lithium mined here for up to 15 years. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=151.28s)]
*  Which Lithium Americas will extract using a process other lithium mines don't, one [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=156.32s)]
*  the company has been testing for years. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=161.23999999999998s)]
*  We're going to take raw ore and we're going to feed it into these pieces of equipment. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=164.12s)]
*  This slurry is separated, then leached with a sulfuric acid, all part of a process that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=168.86s)]
*  isolates the lithium. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=174.34s)]
*  Through this circuit, what we're removing is magnesium sulfate. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=175.98000000000002s)]
*  Magnesium sulfate is bath salts. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=180.62s)]
*  You could furnish all the spas in the world with the magnesium sulfate that we're removing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=182.96s)]
*  Until finally... [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=189.46s)]
*  And then we end up with high-purity lithium carbonate. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=190.46s)]
*  And up in Tamarack, Minnesota... [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=197.38s)]
*  If you zoom out you can see the intrusion... [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=199.1s)]
*  Talon Metals has been exploring, recording, and mapping this polymetallic deposit, mainly [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=201.1s)]
*  made up of nickel. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  So these are the holes that we drill with our drill rigs to understand what's underneath [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=210.29999999999998s)]
*  our feet. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=214.5s)]
*  And then this is the deposit. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=215.66s)]
*  And so what we can do with this is essentially identify the areas that are valuable to extract. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=216.66s)]
*  Talon estimates there are 17 million metric tons of nickel mineralization sitting within [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=223.42s)]
*  the deposit. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=227.85999999999999s)]
*  So the deposit is quite special. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=229.14s)]
*  It's not the largest in the world by any means, but it is very high grade. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=231.26s)]
*  This piece would run about 9% nickel. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=236.89999999999998s)]
*  And when you move this around, basically everything that flashes is the nickel mineralization. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=238.85999999999999s)]
*  One percent is considered high grade. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=243.66s)]
*  So 9% were significantly higher than what's considered high grade. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=246.1s)]
*  And some of this nickel already has a big name buyer. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=250.26s)]
*  Any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=253.89999999999998s)]
*  Two years after that call, Tesla committed to purchasing 75,000 metric tons of Talon's [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=257.78s)]
*  future product. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=263.02s)]
*  Enough nickel for an estimated 1.2 million Tesla Model Y EVs. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=264.3s)]
*  Taken together, Tamarack's nickel and Thacker Pass' lithium would mean billions in savings [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=269.42s)]
*  for Tesla and GM buyers. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  But these mines aren't open yet and speed bumps are emerging. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=277.7s)]
*  It's been an awful 2024 for Tesla. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=281.9s)]
*  With respect to electric vehicles, prices are just too high. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=284.21999999999997s)]
*  EV sales growth has nearly stalled out in the U.S. in the past year. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=287.94s)]
*  That slowdown has weighed heavily on battery metal prices. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=291.97999999999996s)]
*  Nickel is down 26% since early 2023. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=295.62s)]
*  Lithium is down more than 80%, making mining projects less economically viable. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=299.7s)]
*  It means that projects are being delayed. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=305.09999999999997s)]
*  It means that some projects are being sidelined. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=306.9s)]
*  Lithium is by no means a rare resource, but getting it out of the ground is what's so [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  challenging and we've seen here in the U.S. that it's essentially impossible to get a [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=312.9s)]
*  project permitted. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=316.58s)]
*  Securing the permits needed to open a mine in the U.S. can often take up to 10 years, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=317.94s)]
*  three times more than other countries, according to the National Mining Association. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=322.73999999999995s)]
*  We've spent more than a decade getting to where we are today. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=327.02s)]
*  The Tamarack deposit was discovered in 2008. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=330.34s)]
*  Mining projects, including Thacker Pass and Tamarack, have also faced opposition from [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=333.66s)]
*  environmental and local Native American groups. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=338.22s)]
*  Talon Metals even moved a planned nickel processing facility out of the state. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=341.3s)]
*  Now for some people that's not going to be enough, but at least we hope that people feel [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=345.58000000000004s)]
*  that we have been listening and that we've taken action to do something about it as we [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=350.98s)]
*  plan the mine. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=355.82000000000005s)]
*  Talon hopes to deliver nickel to Tesla in 2028. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=357.70000000000005s)]
*  Team Americas is now fully permitted and will start production in 2027. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=361.06s)]
*  Still, it's going to take more than these initial plans to create a reliable, domestic [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=365.74s)]
*  mineral supply. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=371.3s)]
*  We have found one deposit, but we're finding mineralization in these other areas as well. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=372.54s)]
*  I can definitely see Tamarack growing in the future. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=377.58s)]
*  Our deposit is within an area that's the largest in the world, so expansion opportunities [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=381.98s)]
*  there are quite good. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oh-uARTCQQ&t=387.06s)]
