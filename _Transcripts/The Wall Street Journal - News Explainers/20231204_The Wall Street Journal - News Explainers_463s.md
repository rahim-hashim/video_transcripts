# Can Palmer Luckey Reinvent the U.S. Defense Industry? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288)
*  In November, the defense startup Andral Industries released its latest autonomous weapons systems, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=0.0s)]
*  Roadrunner and Roadrunner M. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=8.92s)]
*  The Roadrunners join Andral's suite of AI-powered unmanned products that are shaking up the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=14.0s)]
*  defense industry. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=18.68s)]
*  Since it was launched in 2017, Andral has found success as a defense department contractor, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=22.84s)]
*  selling autonomous vehicles and the software that powers them. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=28.6s)]
*  Today, the startup's technology is being used across multiple branches of the U.S. military [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=32.24s)]
*  and in both the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Gaza conflicts. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  The company was recently valued at $8.48 billion. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=41.08s)]
*  Andral was created to help build a new type of military to meet the demands of a changing [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=45.32s)]
*  battlefield. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=49.96s)]
*  We are in a position where, over the last decades, we have built the wrong things. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=50.96s)]
*  We need a different kind of U.S. military and a different approach to military power. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=55.0s)]
*  Andral, I think, is a healthy revolution for the defense industry. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=58.92s)]
*  So this is Fury. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=65.32s)]
*  It's an unmanned combat aircraft that is able to work in collaboration with manned fighters, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=66.32s)]
*  with other manned aircraft, to hugely push out the range that we can engage targets at [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=72.0s)]
*  without putting people at risk. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=75.92s)]
*  That's kind of one of the coolest things about autonomous systems, not necessarily the fact [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=78.28s)]
*  that they can think faster or do better than a person, but they can also just throw away [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=81.2s)]
*  their lives. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=85.28s)]
*  Andral's founder, Palmer Lucky, is among the more polarizing figures in the tech industry. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=86.28s)]
*  My name is Palmer Lucky, and I'm a virtual reality enthusiast and the designer of The [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  Rift. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=95.0s)]
*  Lucky first found success when his virtual reality company Oculus was acquired by Facebook [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=96.0s)]
*  for more than $2 billion. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=100.72s)]
*  But in 2017, Lucky was ousted from Facebook after a tumultuous tenure. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=102.84s)]
*  Let me just show you very quickly what our software looks like. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=109.44s)]
*  This is an example of what we think is a pretty intuitive interface. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=111.96s)]
*  The foundation of Andral is Lattice, a software platform that serves as a command center of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=115.48s)]
*  sorts, allowing a single human operator to control and coordinate multiple autonomous [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=120.56s)]
*  robots, be they a drone, a sub, or a mobile sentry. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=126.0s)]
*  What you're going to see at the bottom is essentially all the different assets that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=129.6s)]
*  are a part of the team. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=133.12s)]
*  And then you're going to see a graphical display that looks very similar to a lot of the software [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=134.4s)]
*  that we might use in everyday life where there's a map in the background. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=137.76s)]
*  You're going to see multiple vehicles on that software and each of them, you kind of know [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=141.76s)]
*  what role they're playing. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=145.72s)]
*  Engineers are designing our software much like the people who design the kinds of software [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=146.96s)]
*  that goes on our cell phones or on an iPad. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=152.12s)]
*  It's meant to be very, very user friendly. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=154.0s)]
*  Hardware focused defense companies, that hasn't been the approach. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=157.64s)]
*  The U.S. military likes to buy things. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=161.76s)]
*  The whole contract mechanism is set up to buy things. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  And just now, I think, generationally, culturally, they're starting to catch up to the idea that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=168.92s)]
*  a software package can be just as powerful as the thing that it comes in. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=174.27999999999997s)]
*  But Andral's tech isn't the only thing that sets it apart. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  The startup is also pursuing a business model that borrows a lot of inspiration from the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  tech world. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=185.88s)]
*  The way that the traditional defense, really large defense companies are set up, when they [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=186.88s)]
*  take risk, the market actually frowns upon that risk being taken. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=191.68s)]
*  We are designed completely differently as a company. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=196.24s)]
*  We are designed like a high tech company. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  The set of investors that we have and ultimately, hopefully, when we're a public company, it [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=200.6s)]
*  is expected that we take risk on. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  Andral says it's taking bigger risks because it's betting that the way we fight wars is [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=209.72s)]
*  changing rapidly. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=214.56s)]
*  What we're dealing with right now is a disruption created by technology, created by the threats [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=215.56s)]
*  that we're facing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=220.08s)]
*  Andral's chief strategy officer, Christian Broz, likens this alternative to the Moneyball [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=221.44000000000003s)]
*  system described in Michael Lewis's book of the same name. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=226.16000000000003s)]
*  You guys are talking the same old nonsense. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=229.84s)]
*  We got to think differently. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  In Moneyball, the Oakland A's attempt to put together a baseball club on a budget by employing [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=233.96s)]
*  computer-generated analysis to draft its players. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=239.0s)]
*  Similar to baseball, you have to come up with a strategy that is low cost, that's going [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=242.4s)]
*  to allow you to build an affordable, scalable approach that's going to be successful. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=246.48s)]
*  For military terms, it's not relying upon traditional military systems that come in [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  very small quantities that are rather large, very expensive, very exquisite, hard to produce, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=258.68s)]
*  hard to replace, very manned. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=263.84s)]
*  It's going the opposite direction and relying on larger and larger quantities of smaller, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=265.52s)]
*  lower cost, more autonomous military systems that you can produce very quickly, you can [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=270.96s)]
*  replace very quickly. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=275.72s)]
*  Andral, I think, recognized that there was a gap in what some of the big primes were [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=277.08000000000004s)]
*  doing and sought to fill that gap. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=281.92s)]
*  Thinking differently about defense is something that's hard to do if you've been very successful [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  working in your particular way of thinking about defense. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=288.56s)]
*  That's part of why Andral is so interesting as an alternative mechanism. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=291.72s)]
*  Since the end of the Cold War, America's defense industry has undergone considerable [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=295.36s)]
*  consolidation. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=299.6s)]
*  In the 1990s, the U.S. relied on 51 primary contractors. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=300.6s)]
*  Today, that number is just five. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=304.56s)]
*  Lockheed Martin, Boeing, RTX Corporation, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  According to a 2022 DOD report, fewer contractors has stifled innovation and undermined price [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=312.76s)]
*  competition. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  We live in a world where 80 percent of weapons procurement goes to just five companies. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  One of the biggest issues is cost plus contracts. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=325.12s)]
*  Meaning they're paid for time, materials, workforce and then a fixed percentage of profit [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=328.16s)]
*  on top. Because that profit is a plus, a lot of vendors are incentivized for the cost [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=332.08s)]
*  portion to be as large as possible as well. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=337.96s)]
*  They can often make more money when something takes longer than it was supposed to. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=340.2s)]
*  They can often make more money when they sell a solution that's more expensive rather than [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=343.56s)]
*  a solution that's less expensive. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=347.15999999999997s)]
*  And this wouldn't be a huge problem if there was real competition. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=349.64s)]
*  Andral is carving out an alternative pathway to secure DOD contracts by buying up smaller [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=353.03999999999996s)]
*  startups and small to medium sized businesses. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=358.76s)]
*  So when Andral looks at buying companies, we typically want to buy companies that are [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=361.76s)]
*  quite far along building something that is differentiated, that is far ahead of what [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=365.24s)]
*  we have and that would be difficult for us to catch up with. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=370.0s)]
*  And so what it really comes down to is do they have something that will become much [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=372.76s)]
*  more valuable when paired with our core product, which is Lattice AI? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=376.32s)]
*  Can autonomy make this thing that they're making into a much more powerful product? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=380.44s)]
*  And that's been the basis of all of our acquisitions so far. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  Today, defense contractors produce small numbers of large, expensive, heavily manned, hard [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=388.6s)]
*  to produce weapons systems. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=394.24s)]
*  The so-called moneyball military that companies like Andral are working toward will be made [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=396.16s)]
*  up of large numbers of smaller, lower cost, autonomous systems. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=400.44s)]
*  I don't think that Andral will ever be able to completely replace one of the prime contractors. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=404.72s)]
*  What they do is very specific and very well honed. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=411.20000000000005s)]
*  We unfortunately are in a very uncertain world where great power competition is a potential [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=415.34s)]
*  that's happening right now and that great power conflict is a potential that we all [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=420.17999999999995s)]
*  have to deal with. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=424.61999999999995s)]
*  And in that kind of world, the prime contractors are going to be necessary to build those huge [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=426.41999999999996s)]
*  defense systems. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=430.65999999999997s)]
*  The large primes are struggling to do things the way Andral does because they're publicly [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  traded companies with an existing investor class that invested in them to be a certain [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=436.0s)]
*  type of company. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=439.76s)]
*  At the same time, I hope they do get there. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=440.76s)]
*  I think that maybe they're not going to get quite to where Andral is, but I think that [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=442.78s)]
*  we could get to a future where defense companies are spending more on developing their own [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=446.73999999999995s)]
*  products than the government is. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=450.82s)]
*  I think that's a positive world. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGw3Z4G288&t=452.85999999999996s)]
