Video Description: For decades, Taiwan has looked to its east coast as a safe haven to survive a Chinese invasion until allies, particularly the U.S., can arrive to assist. In the east, Taiwan’s rugged mountain terrain also helps create a natural shield in the event of an attack. But China’s PLA activity on the island’s east has thrown that strategy into question.

WSJ takes a look at how serious China’s threats to Taiwan’s east coast are and explores whether the island needs to change its defense strategy.

# Inside Taiwan’s Strategy to Counter a Chinese Invasion | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY)
*  This is the Taiwan Strait. In recent years, China has sent military aircraft across the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=0.0s)]
*  strait and towards the island's southwest on a near daily basis, repeatedly testing [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=6.2s)]
*  Taiwan's ability to respond to an invasion along its west coast. But this year, China [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  began doing something new. In April and May, Chinese aerial drones went further than ever [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=15.48s)]
*  before encircling the entire island, and fire jets were detected on the island's east [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=20.18s)]
*  coast. Military experts say Taiwan has always relied on its mountainous terrain as a natural [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  shield in the event of an attack, looking to its east as a safe place to refuel and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=29.66s)]
*  rearm its fighter jets if the west coast fell. So China's growing range has led to competing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=34.1s)]
*  ideas amongst the island's current and former military leaders about how Taiwan should respond. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=39.06s)]
*  Terrain cannot protect ourselves anymore compared to decades ago. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=44.74s)]
*  So how serious are these threats to Taiwan's east coast, and does the island need to change [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=51.3s)]
*  its strategy? A key part of Taiwan's current strategy can be found here. This satellite [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=55.38s)]
*  imagery shows an air force base on the island's east that's over 30 years old. Bunkers built [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=61.940000000000005s)]
*  deep into the mountains store fighter jets and anti-ship missiles like these that could [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=66.94s)]
*  launch in response to an attack on the main infrastructure in Taiwan's west. By sheltering [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=71.18s)]
*  these weapons in the mountains, Taipei plans to be able to prevent China from gaining early [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=75.78s)]
*  control of the skies. Experts say this is crucial because the People's Liberation Army of China [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=79.98s)]
*  dwarfs Taiwan's military, limiting the island's capacity to defend against a full-scale invasion [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=84.53999999999999s)]
*  from China on its own. Instead, its main strategy has been to survive in the east until allies, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  including the U.S., can arrive to assist the island. But some experts say China's recent [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=95.02s)]
*  incursions to the island's east and its growing military prowess are making Taiwan's current [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=99.69999999999999s)]
*  strategy outdated. You can see the developments in the modernization of the PLA. They have [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=104.8s)]
*  a lot of the measure and the capability attack from the eastern side. So eastern side is [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=111.74s)]
*  not the same as we thought decades ago. Retired Admiral Lee Hsi-min served for more than 40 [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=118.46s)]
*  years in Taiwan's armed forces, retiring in 2019 as the chief of general staff. Since [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=127.89999999999999s)]
*  leaving Taiwan's military, he's advocated for the island to focus on smaller, widely [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=133.18s)]
*  distributed defenses rather than attempting to match China's offensive capabilities. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=137.74s)]
*  We have to change the overall thinking about how to build up our capability. If China really [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=142.42000000000002s)]
*  wants to invade Taiwan, I believe he should be very confident for their A2AD capability. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=151.02s)]
*  A2AD, or Anti-Access Area Denial, is the ability to control access to a military operation [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=160.02s)]
*  zone, usually using long-range missiles to threaten any enemy forces that try to enter [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=166.18s)]
*  an area. A version of this was seen last year, with Chinese military exercises that simulated [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=170.66s)]
*  a blockade of Taiwan. Live fire drills were carried out in six zones, blocking maritime [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=176.1s)]
*  traffic in those areas, and ballistic missiles were fired into waters off the island's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=181.18s)]
*  east coast. Admiral Lee says China would only attempt an invasion of the island if they [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=185.82s)]
*  were confident that their A2AD capabilities would blockade Taiwan's east robustly enough [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=189.82s)]
*  to dissuade Taiwan's allies from coming to its assistance. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=195.14s)]
*  No one will give you a guarantee that they will be here to aid if they were across the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=198.22s)]
*  straits. So instead of investing in large conventional [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=206.54s)]
*  weapons like tanks and warships, Lee says Taiwan should focus on mobile and civilian [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=209.66s)]
*  capabilities such as portable anti-ship and anti-air missiles, drones and radar systems [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=213.98s)]
*  that could make an invasion too challenging for China to even attempt. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=220.54s)]
*  I believe that the asymmetrical warfare is the key for the weaker side or for the smaller [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=223.78s)]
*  one. In the early stage of the Ukraine War, Russia [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=233.14s)]
*  used a lot of the tanks or armored vehicles to try to directly attack the Kiev, but it [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=236.9s)]
*  failed because Ukraine has a lot of the small asymmetrical arms like the Stinger or the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=244.62s)]
*  Chaplin or the AW. And while Taiwan is building its supply of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=253.78s)]
*  smaller arms, experts say it will still need to rely on the assistance of its allies, who [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=258.62s)]
*  are increasingly signalling their willingness to defend the island. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=263.26s)]
*  A new US access to joint military bases in the Philippines could play a key role in Taiwan's [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=265.98s)]
*  east coast strategy. These new bases are located on the other side of the Baishi Channel, a [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=271.42s)]
*  key access point for the navies of both China and the US, and an important maritime traffic [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=276.38s)]
*  barrier. Some US systems, including high mars, could [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=281.46s)]
*  reach the south of Taiwan if placed on the other side of the channel, allowing them to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=284.5s)]
*  strike back against the Chinese invasion attempt remotely. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=288.21999999999997s)]
*  And while China's movements in the east have made some experts concerned about the island's [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=291.62s)]
*  current strategy, others say Taiwan already has the capabilities it needs to stop China [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=295.14s)]
*  from rounding the island in the event of an invasion. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=299.94s)]
*  In peacetime, you can let the POA's war ship to go around the Taiwan harbor, and then you [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=303.7s)]
*  can go around the island. However, in wartime, it's another situation. We have the right [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=311.46s)]
*  to defend ourselves. Dr. Su Tsu-Yuen is the director of Taiwan's [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=315.9s)]
*  Institute for National Defence and Security Research, a think tank funded by the island's [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=320.41999999999996s)]
*  military. He says watching the war in Ukraine has made it clear that Taiwan has some advantages [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=324.74s)]
*  in the event of an invasion attempt. Ukraine is a so-called ground battlefield. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=329.46s)]
*  However, in Taiwan's case, it's a maritime battle. So Taiwan can use limited resources [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=334.7s)]
*  to create a so-called design zone to blockade the POA's navy or their air force to enter [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=342.82s)]
*  the east side of Taiwan. So to do this, Taiwan is also investing in [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=354.02s)]
*  larger defensive systems like the Patriot and Phalanx, a cannon mounted on military [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=358.74s)]
*  vessels used to stop incoming threats. Taiwan's defence ministry said in earlier remarks that [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=363.3s)]
*  it won't entirely rely on its east coast to be a safe haven in the event of a conflict, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=368.7s)]
*  saying there will be no clear distinction between the front lines and the rear during [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=373.3s)]
*  wartime. While China continues to signal its capabilities to take over Taiwan by force [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=376.90000000000003s)]
*  if necessary, the island is increasingly using its own war games and exercises to show Beijing [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=381.42s)]
*  and the world that it's able to defend itself. I hope our defence can tell the China [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=387.0s)]
*  side, can tell the POA, don't invade us. If you invade, you will suffer a lot of casualties [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=393.1s)]
*  and you are not able to occupy Taiwan physically. So they will think twice. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=401.90000000000003s)]
*  But even as they debate how best to repel an assault, the Taiwanese military circle agree [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=409.70000000000005s)]
*  that the best-case scenario is to avoid any conflict in the strait. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARE4PdYXIY&t=414.5s)]
