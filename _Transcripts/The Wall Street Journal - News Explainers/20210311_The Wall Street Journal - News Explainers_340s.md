# NFTs Are Fueling a Boom in Digital Art. Here’s How They Work | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 11, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M)
*  This is Nian Cat. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=0.0s)]
*  He's part cat, part pop tart. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=3.14s)]
*  The GIF of a rainbow casting feline [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=5.72s)]
*  was a viral meme back in 2011. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=7.72s)]
*  Fast forward to February, 2021, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  the original GIF was sold at an online auction for 300 ether, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=12.8s)]
*  the cryptocurrency that powers the Ethereum network. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=16.76s)]
*  That was equivalent to nearly $600,000 at the time. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  You may be asking how someone can own the original copy [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=24.16s)]
*  of a GIF that was pervasive around the internet. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=27.16s)]
*  It's because it was sold as an NFT, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  or non-fungible token, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=32.64s)]
*  which acts like a digital certificate of authenticity. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=34.44s)]
*  The market for NFTs ballooned in 2020, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=38.28s)]
*  climbing to a market cap of at least 338 million [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=41.36s)]
*  from about 41 million in 2018. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=44.56s)]
*  But skeptics are asking whether these assets [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=47.46s)]
*  are really worth the value assigned to them, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  especially if all it takes to view them [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=52.3s)]
*  is an internet connection. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=54.36s)]
*  To understand how NFTs work, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=57.12s)]
*  first you need to understand what fungibility is. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  Fungibility refers to the ability of an asset [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=62.68s)]
*  to be exchanged or substituted [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=65.0s)]
*  with similar assets of the same value. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=66.72s)]
*  A simple example of a fungible asset is currency. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=69.36s)]
*  Say you have five $1 bills in your wallet. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=72.8s)]
*  You may not want to carry around so much change, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=75.64s)]
*  so you exchange them for a single $5 bill. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=77.84s)]
*  The value of your money is still $5, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=81.16s)]
*  regardless of how much you have in your wallet. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=83.56s)]
*  The value of your money is still $5, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=86.68s)]
*  regardless of the fact it's now in a different form. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=88.84s)]
*  Non-fungible assets are the opposite. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=92.68s)]
*  Each one is unique and can't be easily substituted [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=95.28s)]
*  for something similar. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=98.2s)]
*  Think of the Mona Lisa. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=99.8s)]
*  It's an original piece of art. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=101.48s)]
*  It couldn't be swapped out for, say, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=103.2s)]
*  a Mona Lisa poster from the Louvre gift shop, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=105.04s)]
*  because the poster doesn't hold the same value. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=107.72s)]
*  The idea behind NFTs is that you have this digital signature [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=110.36s)]
*  of the person who created it, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=114.76s)]
*  so you can always go and look at the original and say, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=116.28s)]
*  yes, this is the real one, this is authentic. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=118.72s)]
*  A NFT winds up having that through the blockchain [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=121.48s)]
*  where the information is recorded. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=125.0s)]
*  NFTs are cryptocurrencies, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=128.0s)]
*  but unlike fungible cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=130.16s)]
*  they are completely unique. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=132.88s)]
*  They exist as a string of numbers and letters [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=135.08s)]
*  stored on a blockchain ledger. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=137.4s)]
*  This information can contain who owns the digital asset, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=139.16s)]
*  who sold it, and when it was sold. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=142.24s)]
*  This information is also encrypted, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=144.52s)]
*  ensuring the NFT's authenticity and scarcity. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=146.16s)]
*  In doing so, they fix a difficult problem [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=149.24s)]
*  for digital creators on the internet, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=151.4s)]
*  how to make your creation scarce [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=153.52s)]
*  and therefore more valuable. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=155.12s)]
*  So with NFTs, you wind up having the scarcity [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=157.28s)]
*  because they are non-fungible, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=159.56s)]
*  and because of that, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=161.0s)]
*  there is only one of these tokens that can exist. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=162.08s)]
*  It can't be traded for anything similar [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=165.12s)]
*  because there is nothing similar that exists. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=167.96s)]
*  And so you wind up getting that scarcity [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=170.48s)]
*  and that limitation, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  which helps drive up some of the prices. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  One of the early applications of creating the scarcity [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  was the digital collectible game CryptoKitties, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=180.0s)]
*  which emerged in 2017. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=182.67999999999998s)]
*  Users were able to buy, trade, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=185.16s)]
*  and breed digital cat collectibles. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=186.88s)]
*  Each new cat was an NFT, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=189.04s)]
*  which certified its originality and ownership. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  Since then, NFTs have been applied to video games, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=193.83999999999997s)]
*  digital art, and sports memorabilia. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=196.88s)]
*  One example is NBA Top Shot, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=199.44s)]
*  which allows users to procure a collection [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=201.4s)]
*  of digital basketball highlights, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=203.6s)]
*  like a video clip of a posterizing dunk. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=205.32s)]
*  All highlights are NFTs and have become big business. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=207.84s)]
*  By mid-March, NBA Top Shot had clocked in [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  over $338 million in sales [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=213.56s)]
*  since it went live in October 2020. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=216.28s)]
*  Non-fungible tokens are making their way [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=218.84s)]
*  into the mainstream art world as well. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=220.84s)]
*  Auction House Christie's opened bidding [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=223.28s)]
*  for its first purely digital art NFT. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=225.0s)]
*  Bids rocketed into the millions of dollars. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=228.04s)]
*  People were really excited about NFTs [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=230.88s)]
*  because unlike with the blockchain underlying Bitcoin, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=233.28s)]
*  you can do a lot more complex things with it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=237.2s)]
*  You can wind up setting terms within it, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=239.68s)]
*  such as the original creator upon each resale of this asset [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  will get X amount, or you can take it [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  and you can have an NFT that itself mints other NFTs. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=249.44s)]
*  And it winds up having all of these [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=253.84s)]
*  really untested applications. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=255.84s)]
*  The surface has only been scratched [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=258.8s)]
*  in terms of its potential. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=260.52s)]
*  Along with all the hype around NFTs, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=262.52s)]
*  experts have raised some concerns. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=264.2s)]
*  One issue is that not all NFTs verify [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=266.4s)]
*  the person selling a digital art piece [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  is actually the original creator. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=270.56s)]
*  This is difficult, particularly in online marketplaces. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=272.8s)]
*  One of the concerns is that anyone can essentially [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=275.96s)]
*  go on a lot of these marketplaces and say, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=279.2s)]
*  I am the person who created this token [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=281.8s)]
*  and it can be really hard to verify that, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=284.76s)]
*  especially if you don't know who they actually are [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=287.08s)]
*  or they're saying someone that they're not. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=289.68s)]
*  And some are skeptical that ownership alone [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=292.24s)]
*  makes digital assets valuable. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=294.08s)]
*  When it comes to digital art, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=296.44s)]
*  a buyer owns the original digital painting, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=297.96s)]
*  but the person can't keep others from copying the image [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=300.4s)]
*  and sharing or changing it online. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=302.92s)]
*  You have had a lot of scams in cryptocurrencies [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=305.08s)]
*  just historically. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=308.12s)]
*  And so the concern is that people are hyping these up. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=309.08s)]
*  They're saying like, go buy these NFTs. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=311.84s)]
*  It's great, but in reality, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=314.52s)]
*  there's always gotta be a buyer there to be a seller [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=317.24s)]
*  and people might decide all of a sudden, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=319.96s)]
*  let me cash in my profits [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=322.52s)]
*  and someone's going to be stuck holding the bag. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=323.96s)]
*  Proponents are bullish on the potential for NFTs, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=326.32s)]
*  but critics are wary that it may be [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=329.64s)]
*  a digital bubble in the making. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M&t=331.76s)]
