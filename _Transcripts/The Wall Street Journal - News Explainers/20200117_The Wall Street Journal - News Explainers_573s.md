# How California Wildfires Forced PG&E to Declare Bankruptcy | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 17, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ)
*  This is the Camp Wildfire. On November 8th, 2018, the fire tore across a rural section of Northern California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=0.0s)]
*  It was the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=8.92s)]
*  It consumed the town of Paradise in a matter of hours, forcing its residents to flee in panic. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=12.96s)]
*  An investigation found that the campfire was caused by a line owned by Pacific Gas and Electric, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=24.88s)]
*  or PG&E. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=30.139999999999997s)]
*  It was the latest in a string of fires that ultimately led the state's largest utility company to file for bankruptcy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=31.139999999999997s)]
*  But with this bankruptcy, it isn't just shareholders and creditors who have an interest in the future of the company. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=37.379999999999995s)]
*  Millions of Californians rely on the utility to keep the lights on. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=43.019999999999996s)]
*  And some are questioning whether PG&E can be trusted to do that safely and reliably. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=47.019999999999996s)]
*  That's because, according to documents reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, the company knew for years its equipment had the potential to start fires. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=52.7s)]
*  Yet repeatedly delayed the necessary upgrades to make some of its lines safer. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=59.7s)]
*  This is the story of how PG&E filed for bankruptcy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=64.18s)]
*  In 1905, newly incorporated Pacific Gas and Electric was competing with other utilities to electrify Northern California, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=70.98s)]
*  with power generated high in the Sierra Nevada. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=77.74000000000001s)]
*  A vision of a regional power system was something that really hadn't been tried in too many other places around the world. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=80.54s)]
*  The predecessors to PG&E built a series of dams, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=87.53999999999999s)]
*  then built long high-voltage transmission lines across the Central Valley to San Francisco. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=91.66s)]
*  PG&E emerged really through consolidation of a number of companies to serve more and more parts of Northern California with increasing demands for energy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=98.78s)]
*  I wash and dry your clothes, play your radio, I can heat your coffee pot. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=108.82s)]
*  Remember, just plug in. I'm ready. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=115.02s)]
*  But safety and reliability issues have plagued the utility since the 90s. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=118.69999999999999s)]
*  In 1996, PG&E settled a multi-million dollar lawsuit alleging it tainted drinking water around Hinkley, California. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=123.3s)]
*  In 2001, the California energy crisis resulted in rolling blackouts and drove the corporation's utility arm to file for bankruptcy. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=129.98s)]
*  And in 2010, a PG&E gas pipeline exploded in San Bruno, California, killing eight people. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=137.82s)]
*  PG&E was placed on federal probation as a result of the explosion to ensure the utility operated safely in the communities it served. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=144.34s)]
*  And many of those Northern California communities were growing in rural areas. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=153.34s)]
*  A lot of the residential construction that's occurred over the last several decades has been in what we would call the wildland urban interface, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=158.66s)]
*  the fringe of the built environment, putting people out into the forest. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=168.01999999999998s)]
*  Since that time, there hasn't been a lot of new construction of the backbone system. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=173.14000000000001s)]
*  Many of the utility's transmission towers were constructed in the first half of the 20th century. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=178.38000000000002s)]
*  Outside of Paradise is a high voltage transmission line owned by PG&E. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=184.58s)]
*  The 56 mile line, known as the Caribou Palermo, was built in 1921. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=189.02s)]
*  Its towers and lines tap into a hydroelectric system known as the Stairway of Power. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=193.82000000000002s)]
*  PG&E estimated the mean life expectancy of its high voltage transmission towers was 65 years old. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=199.5s)]
*  But the company estimated the average age of all the towers still in service was 68. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=205.9s)]
*  The oldest towers in the system were 108 years old. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=211.3s)]
*  Equipment like these high voltage and low voltage lines does fail. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=215.98000000000002s)]
*  But the failure is is is low consequence. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=219.82s)]
*  So you'd have an older transmission line that was nearing the end of its service life and something would break during a [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=223.02s)]
*  big winter storm in the Sierra. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=228.5s)]
*  And when the storm ended, PG&E crews could go out and fix the line. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=230.58s)]
*  What's changed is when the power lines fail in California and the consequences of a failure. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=234.46s)]
*  From 2013 to 2019, a historic drought swept across California, killing millions of trees and greatly increasing the risk of fire. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=242.38s)]
*  According to a PG&E list obtained by The Wall Street Journal, the Caribou Palermo was one of the grid's worst performing [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=251.9s)]
*  circuits. It also ran through areas that were identified as posing elevated and extreme fire risks. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=257.94s)]
*  In 2017, PG&E equipment started 18 fires that killed 22 people, according to state fire officials. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  According to an internal presentation from that same year, the company said it needed a plan to replace its steel structure [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=272.26s)]
*  transmission towers and better manage its equipment to prevent it from causing fires. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=278.14s)]
*  On the morning of November 8th, 2018, winds picked up before sunrise in your paradise. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=282.5s)]
*  A hook connecting a power line to a Caribou Palermo tower failed, causing the line to strike the tower and emit sparks that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=288.34s)]
*  fell to the ground. A few minutes later, a PG&E worker spotted a small fire near the tower. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=295.38s)]
*  That fire grew quickly. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=300.9s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=303.22s)]
*  By 8 a.m., local officials had given the order to evacuate the tower. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=306.98s)]
*  By 10 45, the fire had overtaken parts of paradise. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=310.42s)]
*  Trying to get out of paradise. This is bad. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=314.34000000000003s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=319.38s)]
*  County 14 is bad. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=321.3s)]
*  Take on. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=323.06s)]
*  By 6 p.m., the fire had completely consumed the town. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=334.58000000000004s)]
*  In the aftermath, the local sheriff's office said bodies were found in vehicles, most likely of people who were trying to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=337.86s)]
*  escape the fire. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=344.74s)]
*  Anthropologists and forensic dentists were tasked with identifying human remains that sometimes consisted only of a few [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=346.98s)]
*  bone fragments or teeth. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=352.74s)]
*  For PG&E, the destruction caused by the campfire was an existential threat. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=356.5s)]
*  The utility faced backfire damage, and the fire was destroyed by a fire that was not a fire. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=361.78000000000003s)]
*  There were thousands of wildfire claims seeking damages for, amongst other things, wrongful death, personal injury, and property damage. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=367.7s)]
*  From October 2018 to January 2019, PG&E's market value slid from about $25 billion to $9 billion. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=375.78000000000003s)]
*  By declaring bankruptcy, the utility's strategy was to fold these claims into a bankruptcy proceeding, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=383.62s)]
*  allowing the company to negotiate settlements with all of its creditors, including the fire victims. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=388.74s)]
*  A Wall Street Journal investigation revealed the company knew that 57 of the steel towers on the Caribou-Polermo line needed [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=394.97999999999996s)]
*  hardware replaced, and another 49 towers needed to be replaced entirely before the campfire. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=401.53999999999996s)]
*  In 2013, PG&E told federal regulators it had a $30 million plan to replace equipment on the Caribou-Polermo line, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=407.7s)]
*  but it repeatedly delayed the project for five years. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=415.38s)]
*  It was slated to begin as late as June 2018, but it didn't happen. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=419.06s)]
*  The utility released a statement in response to the journal's reporting saying the scheduled work wasn't maintenance-related, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=424.02s)]
*  and that the tower that malfunctioned before the campfire wasn't slated to be part of the project. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=431.7s)]
*  PG&E later acknowledged in federal court it had long known that its high-voltage lines could fail and trigger fires, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=437.46s)]
*  but said that such fires have historically been relatively rare. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=443.85999999999996s)]
*  I think the utilities in California recognize that they're operating in a different world today, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=448.26s)]
*  and that if they cause fires, they won't have a business. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=453.7s)]
*  In December 2019, state investigators found a dozen violations the utility had committed in [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=458.58s)]
*  maintaining its transmission lines and towers. PG&E acknowledges it still has work to do. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=464.26s)]
*  Since the campfire, it has inspected all its towers, lines, and substations. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=470.02s)]
*  It identified 1,200 immediate safety risks and another 10,000 less urgent repairs, and is making fixes. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=474.42s)]
*  It is also committed to sharing the results of its inspections with state regulators and the public. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=480.5s)]
*  PG&E has also permanently retired the Caribou Palermo line. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=485.38s)]
*  Well, I think in the long run, all of the utilities need to harden their grid. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=489.06s)]
*  In the short run, and maybe even the medium term, PG&E is also going to be turning off the power. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=493.62s)]
*  Since 2018, PG&E has initiated several weather-related power shutoffs to prevent its equipment from starting more fires, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=500.1s)]
*  including one that cut power to nearly 750,000 homes and businesses. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=507.3s)]
*  PG&E's future remains uncertain. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=512.1800000000001s)]
*  The utility has reached a $13.5 billion settlement with fire victims, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=514.98s)]
*  but faces a major hurdle in appeasing the state of California, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=519.7s)]
*  which has raised the specter of a public takeover if PG&E doesn't enact certain reforms. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=522.98s)]
*  If Pacific Gas and Electric is unable to secure its own fate and future, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=528.82s)]
*  then the state will prepare itself as backup for a scenario where we do that job for them. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=533.86s)]
*  People expect that their power is going to be on all the time, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=543.62s)]
*  and that the system will not cause them to be afraid. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=547.62s)]
*  But that's kind of where we live right now in Northern California. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=551.86s)]
*  And until that changes, I think there is going to be push for much greater oversight of a company. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=555.54s)]
*  I think that's a challenging environment for a utility to operate in, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=561.38s)]
*  particularly one that's trying to get out of bankruptcy. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfZ7QyrlEjQ&t=564.5s)]
