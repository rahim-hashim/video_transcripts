Video Description: The 2024 Republican presidential primary kicks off Monday with the Iowa caucus. Iowa is a big deal every year because it’s the first event, but this year it’s a big deal because it will tell us that night how long this primary is going to be. 

Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis are in a race for second place: but that’s what you want to win in Iowa, anyway. WSJ’s political wonk Aaron Zitner explains what to watch in Iowa Monday.

# What These Three Scenarios in Iowa Reveal About 2024's GOP Primary  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc)
*  The polls heading into the Iowa Republican caucuses look like, well, Trump winning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=0.0s)]
*  But what's interesting is what's happening down here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=5.2s)]
*  So we asked our political editor, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=8.24s)]
*  You can write Aaron Zittner, wonk, if you want. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=10.24s)]
*  to explain what's really happening in the first stop of the Republican primary. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=13.24s)]
*  Well, the race in Iowa is largely about who comes in second and by how much. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  It's going to give us the first clues in actual votes, not in polls or in media attention, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  to whether the Republican Party really is ready to consolidate behind Donald Trump. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=28.24s)]
*  Here's why the Iowa caucus will likely determine how the rest of the Republican primary will go. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=33.239999999999995s)]
*  Let's look at some of the scenarios that could come out of Iowa. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  First and most likely, Donald Trump dominates. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  That would give us a lot of signals about where the Republican Party is right now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  Because the party in Iowa hasn't gathered behind Trump, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  Ron DeSantis has gotten the endorsement of Iowa's very popular Republican governor [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=54.24s)]
*  and arguably the biggest evangelical leader in the state. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=58.24s)]
*  And he's visited all 99 counties. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=62.24s)]
*  Nikki Haley, meanwhile, has been campaigning hard in Iowa [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  and is set up to spend the most in ads leading up to the caucus. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  If Donald Trump runs away with the race in Iowa, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  that will tell us that even influential Republicans don't have the juice [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  to persuade Republican voters that it's time to turn the page and to move on to another leader. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=80.24s)]
*  A second possibility? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=86.24s)]
*  Donald Trump wins, but by less of a margin. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=89.24s)]
*  And the second place is kind of a tie between Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=93.24s)]
*  That's also a good outcome for Donald Trump, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=99.24s)]
*  because it will mean that voters who don't want him haven't consolidated around any individual contender against him [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=102.24s)]
*  and instead are dividing their vote among multiple candidates. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=108.24s)]
*  That happened in 2016. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=111.24s)]
*  Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio split the non-Trump vote in a bunch of states, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=113.24s)]
*  but that just allowed Trump to win and rack up the delegate count needed for the nomination. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=117.24s)]
*  And then we come to a third scenario, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=122.24s)]
*  and that's the one where a single candidate emerges from Iowa [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=125.24s)]
*  with enough momentum to give Donald Trump a real race throughout the primaries. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=129.24s)]
*  If one candidate does well in Iowa, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=135.24s)]
*  it would signal to voters in other states and donors that they're a viable contender. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=137.24s)]
*  Just like it did for Trump in 2016 or Romney in 2012. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=142.24s)]
*  They both came in second in Iowa, but won New Hampshire next, and eventually the nomination. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=146.24s)]
*  And that's not unusual. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=152.24s)]
*  Whoever wins Iowa usually doesn't become the nominee. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=154.24s)]
*  It doesn't help that Iowa is [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=158.24s)]
*  very agricultural and very rural. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=160.24s)]
*  But there are some places that could give us clues to what might be coming next in the primary process. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=162.24s)]
*  And we'll look for those here and here, right around Des Moines, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=167.24s)]
*  and in the two university towns just north of Des Moines and over here at the University of Iowa. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=171.24s)]
*  Their upper income, they are more highly educated, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=176.24s)]
*  and that means they look a little bit more like the state of New Hampshire, which votes next. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=179.24s)]
*  If Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis don't do well in these areas that are suburban and university heavy, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=185.24s)]
*  it's a signal that they might not be doing well in the states that come next. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=191.24s)]
*  And there's another reason Haley or DeSantis might want to stay in the race. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=196.24s)]
*  The numerous legal battles Trump is currently facing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=200.24s)]
*  They don't want to have dropped out if something unexpected happens [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=203.24s)]
*  and all of a sudden Donald Trump isn't there to claim the nomination. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=206.24s)]
*  Iowa hasn't been a kingmaker. Instead, it's been a winnower. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=210.24s)]
*  Defining who the top candidates are going to be in the primary from a large field, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=214.24s)]
*  and boosting the profile of those that do well. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=219.24s)]
*  In 2024, it will do it again, but whether it windows it to one, two, or three candidates [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=222.24s)]
*  will also show us if this primary will be over in one month or six. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZJuM9Ojdc&t=228.24s)]
