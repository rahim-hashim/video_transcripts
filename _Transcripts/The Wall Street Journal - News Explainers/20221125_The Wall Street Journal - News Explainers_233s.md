# From Disney’s Robert Iger to Apple’s Steve Jobs: Why Companies Rehire Old CEOs | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY)
*  I really needed to turn over the reins to Bob, to someone else. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=0.0s)]
*  That was Robert Iger in 2020, when he stepped down as CEO of Disney, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=4.16s)]
*  the company he led for 15 years. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=7.92s)]
*  Two years later, he's now back, after the board ousted Bob Chapek [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=10.16s)]
*  following weak fourth quarter earnings. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=13.6s)]
*  Disney stock rallied after the announcement. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=15.76s)]
*  Bringing back a CEO is a strategy that many companies have attempted over the years, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=18.56s)]
*  some more successfully than others. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=23.28s)]
*  This is how three so-called boomerang CEOs made comebacks, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=25.2s)]
*  and how their companies fared after their return. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=29.2s)]
*  A former CEO can help revive a company's culture. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=32.16s)]
*  They're often viewed as the face of the company. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=35.68s)]
*  They often have inspired the hearts and minds a lot of people sometimes say. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=38.4s)]
*  Bob Iger was someone that, while he was not a founder, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=43.92s)]
*  people have described him as a quasi-founder in the sense that he was a larger-than-life CEO. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=46.96s)]
*  Like Iger, Howard Schultz was considered a popular CEO at Starbucks. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=52.4s)]
*  He first stepped down as CEO in 2000, but returned in 2008 as the coffee chain sales slumped. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=56.88s)]
*  After cost cuts, Schultz got Starbucks to profitability. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=63.28s)]
*  By the time he stepped down again in 2017, Starbucks' stock was up 640%. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=66.72s)]
*  But when he returned once more in 2022 on an interim basis, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  he found a different company, facing worker dissatisfaction and pandemic consumer shifts. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=77.44s)]
*  I came back to reinvent the role and responsibility of a public company [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=83.04s)]
*  at a time where there is a cultural and political change. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=87.2s)]
*  Starbucks has said that it will invest $1 billion into employees and store experience. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=91.76s)]
*  A returning CEO or founder has to come back to a different company. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=97.44000000000001s)]
*  So remember, someone else has been leading it for usually a couple of years at least. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=102.48s)]
*  That means the strategy has often shifted. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=107.04s)]
*  So Spencer Stewart looked at across all CEOs that were appointed at S&P 500 companies since 2010. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=109.76s)]
*  And eight out of 13 permanent boomerang appointments [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=117.28s)]
*  did worse during their second stint than during their first stint. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  Twitter's co-founder Jack Dorsey was fired in 2008 in part for frequent absences. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=124.64s)]
*  The board brought him back in 2015. They basically wanted to reassure investors, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=130.24s)]
*  and the hope was to revive the social media companies' sagging user growth. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=136.24s)]
*  During his second run, some employees said he acted too slowly on issues like hate speech, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=140.88s)]
*  harassment and censoring. Dorsey left the CEO post again in 2021. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=145.68s)]
*  During his second tenure, Twitter shares gained 63% while the Nasdaq composite more than doubled. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=150.56s)]
*  Twitter and Dorsey did not immediately respond to requests for comment. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  When he left, he said in a statement that founders leading companies can be severely limiting. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=160.24s)]
*  But founders like Dorsey are common boomerang CEOs. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=165.44s)]
*  What we often see is that CEOs who are either founders or really connected to companies [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=168.64s)]
*  feel that it's their duty, their service to make sure that the company succeeds. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=175.52s)]
*  One of the most prominent examples from the late 90s is Steve Jobs coming back to run Apple [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=181.04s)]
*  when it was on the brink of bankruptcy. Jobs first left Apple in 1985. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  He returned in 1997 as an advisor and eventually took the CEO title. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=191.44s)]
*  He quickly brokered a surprise deal with Microsoft, sending the stock up. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  And he brought Apple back to profitability within a year. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=210.4s)]
*  By the time he stepped down in 2011, Jobs had helped turn Apple into a smartphone giant. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=213.52s)]
*  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=219.28s)]
*  As for Eiger, he now has two more years at the top at Disney. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=222.32s)]
*  Investors hope he can turn things around, despite the company's tumultuous year. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYVCbycFEvY&t=225.6s)]
