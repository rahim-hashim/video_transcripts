Video Description: As thousands of people are killed in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, the United Nations is warning of even more deaths from dehydration and waterborne diseases from a water shortage crisis. The World Health Organization says two million Gazans are subsisting on about three liters of water a day for all of their needs, including drinking, cooking and washing. 

WSJ explains why Gaza has so little water.

# Why Gazans Don’t Have Enough Water to Survive | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY)
*  People in Gaza have been forced to use seawater to clean themselves, wash their clothes and clean the dishes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a result of Israel's siege, which restricted the supply of water, food, fuel and medicine into the Palestinian enclave [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=8.0s)]
*  in response to Hamas' deadly attacks on October 7. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=17.0s)]
*  The World Health Organization said that more than 2 million Gazans have to get by on just 3 liters of water per day [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=21.0s)]
*  for drinking, cooking and washing. That's just one-fifth of the absolute minimum of 15 liters needed for basic survival, according to the WHO. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=29.0s)]
*  Gaza's water crisis began well before the current conflict between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=41.0s)]
*  Most of Gaza's fresh water comes from a shallow aquifer, which was contaminated with sewage and seawater even before the war. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=48.0s)]
*  The UN has said that as much as 96% of it is not fit for human consumption. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=57.0s)]
*  So Gazans had to rely on unregulated private water tankers and desalination plants for drinking water. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=63.0s)]
*  There are three major desalination plants, while some of the water is purchased from Israel. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=70.0s)]
*  Years of conflicts worsen the already inadequate water infrastructure. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=76.0s)]
*  In 2007, Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza after Hamas took over power in the Strip. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=82.0s)]
*  That severely restricted the entry of materials to repair and maintain water systems. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=90.0s)]
*  Then Israel ordered a total siege of Gaza after the Hamas attacks. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=97.0s)]
*  There is no electricity, no gas, no water, no water. Everything is closed. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=103.0s)]
*  In the aftermath of the assault, Israel also turned off water pipelines. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=109.0s)]
*  In late October, Israeli officials said that water was flowing through two of the three pipelines. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=114.0s)]
*  As fuel started to run out, two of the three desalination plants in Gaza had to shut down. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=121.0s)]
*  The last desalination plant still in operation was only working at 5% capacity in late October. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=128.0s)]
*  All wastewater plants in Gaza are shut down due to the lack of power, resulting in raw sewage flooding the streets. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=136.0s)]
*  Since mid-October, more than 30,000 cases of diarrhea have been reported, according to the WHO. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=145.0s)]
*  Over half of those are among children under five years old. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=153.0s)]
*  The UN's children's agency warns that in conflict areas, children under five are 20 times more likely to die of diseases linked to diarrhea than to violence. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=157.0s)]
*  My stomach and stomach are very hungry. I get a lot of diseases from this and my mother and my brothers are suffering from contaminated water. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=168.0s)]
*  Long queues of people waiting to fill jerry cans are now commonplace across the territory as water becomes increasingly scarce. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=178.0s)]
*  The amount of water on which Gazans rely on now is a fraction of the WHO-recommended range of 50 to 100 litres a day. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=188.0s)]
*  And it's negligible compared to what people in Israel consume on average every day, according to a UN report. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=198.0s)]
*  The Israeli military said Gaza has sufficient water supplies as well as access to solar power and diesel. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=206.0s)]
*  It accused Hamas of limiting civilians' access to those vital resources. Hamas denies this. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=221.0s)]
*  What Gaza really needs, according to humanitarian organisations, is fuel to restore power. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=229.0s)]
*  Since the conflicts began on October 7, Israel allowed only half a tanker of fuel to enter the besieged enclave by the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=236.0s)]
*  Fuel here in Gaza is absolutely everything because without fuel you do not have a generator, you do not have a functioning bakery, you do not have a functioning hospital and you cannot pump water. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=247.0s)]
*  In mid-November, the UN said 200,000 Gazans lost access to clean water after its two water distribution contractors stopped working due to the lack of fuel. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=264.0s)]
*  Some aid trucks have entered Gaza in recent weeks, but the UN says they are not bringing in nearly enough fresh water. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1l1zE_zIY&t=277.0s)]
