# College-Town Economies Brace for Covid Blow | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 25, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c)
*  Main Street in Pullman, Washington, home to Washington State University, shows a glimpse [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=0.0s)]
*  of college town life leading into this semester. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=5.32s)]
*  In a typical fall, the town population swells to about 35,000 as more than 20,000 students [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=8.76s)]
*  report for class. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=14.84s)]
*  But this semester, the on-campus residence halls and apartments will be virtually empty, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=16.72s)]
*  and the more than 30,000 seats in Martin Stadium will be too. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=21.72s)]
*  It's not just Pullman. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=26.32s)]
*  One study says as of mid-August, the coronavirus has pushed nearly half of U.S. colleges and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=27.94s)]
*  universities into some degree of remote learning. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=33.1s)]
*  That could mean fewer students and visitors in college towns, which could lead to lower [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=36.660000000000004s)]
*  sales for restaurants, gas stations, and hotels. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=40.32s)]
*  That's sending shockwaves through the economies of many college towns. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=43.74s)]
*  In Pullman, Washington, WSU dominates the landscape and the economy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=50.34s)]
*  Anna Brown, an economist at MC, creates models of spending patterns in college towns. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=56.58s)]
*  So when we look at these analyses, what we want to look at is the new economic activity [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=61.62s)]
*  created in a town or in a region as a result of a university. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=67.3s)]
*  So the operation spending impact is what we call it, tends to be one of the largest impacts, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=71.3s)]
*  and we especially see that with WSU in Pullman. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=75.86s)]
*  Brown's model says that the university's day-to-day spending brought $779 million in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=79.5s)]
*  the Pullman's economy in a recent fiscal year. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=84.82s)]
*  That includes spending on staff payrolls, equipment purchases, and food. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=88.38s)]
*  And then how that spending ripples through the local economy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=92.94s)]
*  The school's budget comes from a few revenue streams, including enrollments and public [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=97.5s)]
*  funding. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=101.13999999999999s)]
*  Both are expected to be down in part due to the coronavirus. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=102.14s)]
*  Washington State is asking public universities to plan for a 15% reduction in state funding [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=105.94s)]
*  for the 2021 fiscal year. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=111.58s)]
*  WSU's financial officer said that the budget cut for the school is roughly equal to the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=114.58s)]
*  cost to run the colleges of business, communication, and education combined. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=119.22s)]
*  Similar losses could happen elsewhere in the country. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=125.42s)]
*  In California, public colleges faced $602 million in reductions. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=128.66s)]
*  The state of Maryland imposed 8% cuts on higher education, which may reduce university spending [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=133.86s)]
*  as well. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=139.02s)]
*  The budget could stall or even be down at some schools, potentially hurting school budgets [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=141.34s)]
*  and interrupting spending on college town communities. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=145.62s)]
*  In the Northeast, the enrollment dip could cause some schools to shutter altogether. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=148.94s)]
*  19 cities and towns in New England have economies that rely on financially vulnerable colleges, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=153.62s)]
*  according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=159.58s)]
*  The financial health of a college town depends on university spending. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=164.7s)]
*  But student activity plays an important role too. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=168.54s)]
*  MC's analysis of Pullman says student spending had an impact of $48.5 million last year. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  That's equivalent to about 1,200 local jobs. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=178.85999999999999s)]
*  This includes the spending that students spend for their room and board, particularly for [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  off-campus students, as well as for their day-to-day expenses, as they're going to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=187.78s)]
*  local restaurants, as they're spending money on gas and so forth. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=193.66s)]
*  All of that is considered within the student spending impact. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=197.5s)]
*  And really what we're focusing in on there are students who are relocating to Pullman [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=200.3s)]
*  or students who stay in Pullman because of WSU. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=204.94s)]
*  If students stay away, Pullman businesses will see fewer sales and the city government [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=208.3s)]
*  will see less tax revenues. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=212.54s)]
*  But the city administrator of Pullman says that at least some students are returning [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=214.86s)]
*  to their off-campus apartments. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=218.5s)]
*  Their activity could help offset the impact of budget cuts. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=220.7s)]
*  In conversations with the university, they're planning currently for about 70% of the students [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=224.6s)]
*  to return. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  And the students are such a huge impact on our community. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, they're residents most of the time of the year as well. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=234.0s)]
*  So anytime they're going out and spending, that means a big impact. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=237.32s)]
*  Other schools are working with local businesses to welcome students back. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  That could alleviate some of the economic pain. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  Virginia Tech is welcoming students back to Blacksburg, but off-campus students can't [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=248.32s)]
*  buy on-campus meal plans. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=252.52s)]
*  That could divert more spending toward local restaurants and grocers. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  Back out west, Moscow, Idaho is welcoming 12,000 students to attend the University of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  Idaho. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=264.04s)]
*  Their campus is 10 miles away from WSU. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=265.24s)]
*  That could draw more students into the region, helping mitigate some of the economic damage. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=268.6s)]
*  But the loss of fall sports could significantly reduce visitor spending. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=273.68s)]
*  In Pullman, visitors brought $17.3 million into the local economy in a recent fiscal [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=278.32s)]
*  year. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=284.0s)]
*  During big football events, there are a lot of Cougar fans who live in the Seattle area. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=285.0s)]
*  And so they are coming from Seattle every weekend or every home game weekend to watch [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=291.36s)]
*  the football game. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=295.64s)]
*  And so then they're bringing that money with them, and that's creating the economic impact [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=296.64s)]
*  by spending locally. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=300.6s)]
*  And it's money that would not have otherwise been spent if not for the university home [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  games or other events such as graduation or mom's weekend and those types of events. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=307.12s)]
*  But this spring, as the country sheltered in place, events were called off. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=313.35999999999996s)]
*  Craig Depkin, a professor of economics at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=318.12s)]
*  says that game day spending from visitors will be missed most in the smallest college [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  towns. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=327.12s)]
*  Let's say a town like Prairie View, Texas, which has about 5,600 people some land, roughly [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=328.12s)]
*  around 6,000 people in the town. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=333.64s)]
*  That's a small town. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=335.52s)]
*  So the economy is not going to be very huge. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=336.52s)]
*  It will have its fast food restaurants and it will have its gas stations. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=338.28s)]
*  Then you look at the football stadium at Prairie View A&M. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=342.28s)]
*  If that stadium is full, it has more people in the stadium than live in the entire town. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=345.32s)]
*  One of his studies found that in smaller college towns, games can promote economic growth. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=351.96s)]
*  But Prairie View A&M's athletics conference postponed fall sports. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=357.47999999999996s)]
*  Some of the biggest football conferences are following suit. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=362.8s)]
*  Washington State University's PAC-12 conference postponed fall athletics, as did the Big Ten. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=366.48s)]
*  With football season postponed, college towns like Pullman may see a reduction in spending [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=372.6s)]
*  as they could from their other two main sources. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=377.48s)]
*  Spending in college towns will be down this fall. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=381.12s)]
*  The expected slowdown in activity could eliminate vital jobs. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=383.76s)]
*  As fall approaches, economists are watching. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TmfJlqq__c&t=387.98s)]
