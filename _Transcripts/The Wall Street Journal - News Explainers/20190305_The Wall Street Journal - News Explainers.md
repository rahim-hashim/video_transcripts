# Five Myths About 5G, Debunked  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 05, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg)
*  News is heating up about 5G, the ultra-fast wireless technology that has the potential to connect everything from smartphones to self-driving cars to virtual worlds. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=0.0s)]
*  The race to 5G is moving forward at full speed. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=12.0s)]
*  AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile all say that 5G technology is at the heart of their new corporate strategies. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=15.0s)]
*  It will allow us to do all kinds of stuff like streaming your favorite videos up to 100 times faster. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=22.0s)]
*  But the fifth generation of wireless connectivity has spurred a lot of rumors about its potential, some of which are less than accurate. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=27.0s)]
*  We're going to separate fact from fiction and walk you through five of the biggest myths about 5G. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=34.0s)]
*  While 5G networks are expected to be up to 100 times faster than current 4G networks, it doesn't end there. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=42.0s)]
*  5G is being marketed as a platform that will enhance the user experience of many different technologies and devices. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=49.0s)]
*  Take this 5G robot on display at the 2019 MWC trade show in Barcelona. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=55.0s)]
*  It can serve you a coffee. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=61.0s)]
*  The current 4G network just isn't nimble enough to operate a machine like this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=63.0s)]
*  So the robot itself is now an avatar. It connects to the cloud over mobile network. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=68.0s)]
*  In addition to serving coffee, 5G is expected to make it possible to automate more manufacturing by improving the efficiency of machines [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=76.0s)]
*  and allowing humans to work alongside them with augmented reality headsets. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=84.0s)]
*  What makes 5G unique isn't the amount of data it can send at a given time, but rather its low latency connections. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=90.0s)]
*  Bandwidth measures the amount of data that can be transferred at a given time. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=97.0s)]
*  Latency measures the speed of communication between two points. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=101.0s)]
*  5G promises low latency connections, which could be a game changer in a range of industries. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=105.0s)]
*  For example, analysts think the data could travel almost instantly, maybe even fast enough to mimic human reflexes, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=110.0s)]
*  which could help doctors perform remote medical procedures. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=117.0s)]
*  Verizon's 5G ultra-wideband network aims to do just that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=121.0s)]
*  Low latency is crucial for things like surgery because the response time has to be immediate. It has to be real. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=126.0s)]
*  While the technology hasn't been widely deployed yet, the idea is that 5G would allow a physical therapist to help a patient [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=133.0s)]
*  recover their range of motion after surgery or allow students at research hospitals to watch remote surgeries in near real time. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=140.0s)]
*  The low latency also helps increase point-to-point communication for driverless cars, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=147.0s)]
*  as seen with this self-driving bus that was on display at South Korea's 2018 Olympic Games. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=152.0s)]
*  5G connections will allow automakers to transmit large amounts of data at speeds far faster than the current generation cellular service, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=158.0s)]
*  which could allow vehicles to talk directly with each other on the road. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=165.0s)]
*  Like 4G, 5G is set to kickstart a wide range of innovation in the mobile field. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=173.0s)]
*  But it's also making inroads into many different industries, including entertainment, construction, and even farming. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=178.0s)]
*  Agricultural manufacturer John Deere hopes to use 5G technology on its farms, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=184.0s)]
*  as it could allow equipment like tractors to communicate with other machines on the field much faster. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=189.0s)]
*  The company said 5G could allow a skilled operator to run multiple machines simultaneously [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=194.0s)]
*  and facilitate real-time data capture and decision-making. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=200.0s)]
*  Over time, 5G could theoretically replace 4G, but that's at least decades away. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=203.0s)]
*  That's because 5G requires new infrastructure, clusters of antennas that are closer to the users. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=208.0s)]
*  This will likely take years to install across the country. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=214.0s)]
*  And while most of the major cell carriers have already started to roll out 5G, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=218.0s)]
*  they've only started installing it in some major cities, meaning 4G isn't going anywhere in the near future. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=222.0s)]
*  This brings us to our final myth, that 5G is coming soon. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=228.0s)]
*  This is only true for people in certain areas of some big cities. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=232.0s)]
*  In the U.S., one of the first countries with 5G services, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=236.0s)]
*  many of the major cell carriers, including Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile, have announced plans for nationwide 5G coverage. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=240.0s)]
*  We're planning for a 5G future that covers you from cover to cover. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=248.0s)]
*  We're planning for a 5G future that covers you from coast to coast and everywhere in between. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=254.0s)]
*  But so far, these carriers have only deployed 5G in large cities with high population densities. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=261.0s)]
*  T-Mobile customers, for example, can expect 5G access in at least five cities, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=267.0s)]
*  including Dallas, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and New York by the end of 2019. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=272.0s)]
*  But since providers are focusing first on bigger cities, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=277.0s)]
*  the launch of 5G services could take many years to reach rural areas across the country. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=280.0s)]
*  And many rural areas in the U.S. have yet to even adopt 4G, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=286.0s)]
*  meaning a nationwide deployment of 5G technologies could be a long way away. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9G7ef9uBg&t=290.0s)]
