# Apple,  Nintendo and Huawei The Future of 'Made in China'  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 27, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E)
*  From Apple phones to Nintendo consoles, many of the products Americans love are made in China. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=0.0s)]
*  But is that about to change? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=7.0s)]
*  The country has long been the world's manufacturing powerhouse, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=9.0s)]
*  because it has the raw materials and chief workers to power supply chains. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=12.0s)]
*  For years, companies, especially tech giants like Apple and Dell, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=16.0s)]
*  have relied on Chinese factories to assemble their products. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=20.0s)]
*  Because of the ongoing trade dispute between the US and China, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=24.0s)]
*  an escalating tariff threat from the Trump administration, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=28.0s)]
*  many manufacturers have started to lay out plans to shift some of that production elsewhere. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=31.0s)]
*  In a recent survey of 250 companies operating in China, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=36.0s)]
*  40% have said that they are considering or have relocated manufacturing facilities outside the country. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=40.0s)]
*  Analysts expect there could be more if the trade dispute escalates. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=47.0s)]
*  Here are three cases that can tell us why companies are looking to move out of China. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=51.0s)]
*  First, tariffs. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=58.0s)]
*  This is one of the biggest concerns for any company that is importing made-in-China products into the US. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=60.0s)]
*  In May, the US increased import tariffs to 25% from 10% on $200 billion of Chinese goods. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=67.0s)]
*  The Trump administration is also planning to place tariffs on an additional $300 billion of Chinese imports. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=75.0s)]
*  If this new round of tariffs kicks in, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=81.0s)]
*  it would cover electronics like smartphones, laptops, and video game consoles, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=83.0s)]
*  which are almost entirely imported from China. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=87.0s)]
*  Companies like Nintendo want to limit the impact of these US tariffs on Chinese-made electronics. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=91.0s)]
*  For years, the Japanese company needed low-contract manufacturers in China to assemble its video game hardware. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=97.0s)]
*  That's because video game platform owners tend to sell hardware at a thin profit, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=104.0s)]
*  so it's not the console that brings in the big bucks, it's the revenue from games. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=109.0s)]
*  If Nintendo had to pay a 25% tariff to import its Chinese-made consoles into the US, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=113.0s)]
*  that thin profit would be decimated. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=119.0s)]
*  So, Nintendo has said it's shifting production to Southeast Asia to limit that impact. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=121.0s)]
*  The company has started producing the Switch and two new models there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=126.0s)]
*  Companies are also realizing that they can't put all their eggs in one basket, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=132.0s)]
*  with the lingering trade dispute between China and the US, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=136.0s)]
*  many companies might also have to think about diversifying production locations. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=139.0s)]
*  One example is Apple. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=144.0s)]
*  The company relies on hundreds of thousands of workers [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=145.0s)]
*  and its deep network of suppliers in China to crank out iPhones. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=148.0s)]
*  People familiar with the matter said Apple is now asking suppliers to consider shifting the final assembly elsewhere. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=152.0s)]
*  The company declined to comment. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=158.0s)]
*  Luckily, one of Apple's contract manufacturers, Foxconn, says it's ready to move. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=160.0s)]
*  The company says it has about 25% of its manufacturing outside the mainland, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=165.0s)]
*  and its factories around the world can keep churning out sufficient quantities of Apple products. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=170.0s)]
*  Some companies are worried about being swept up in the political tit-for-tat between China and the US. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=177.0s)]
*  Case in point, Huawei. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=182.0s)]
*  The US hit the Chinese telecom giant with an export ban shortly after trade talks collapsed last month, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=184.0s)]
*  which barred many American companies and beyond from doing business with the company. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=190.0s)]
*  China responded by saying it will create its own list of foreign entities seen as damaging to Chinese companies and national interests. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=195.0s)]
*  Manufacturers are also worried about increased roadblocks that Chinese authorities may put up, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=201.0s)]
*  like increased regulation, customs delays, or greater scrutiny. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=206.0s)]
*  Before negotiations collapsed, both countries were discussing ways to make it easier for foreign companies to invest and operate in China. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=210.0s)]
*  But now that talks are at a stalemate, Chinese officials have warned there could be consequences if companies move. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=218.0s)]
*  It's been a long year of trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing, and a deal likely won't come anytime soon. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=225.0s)]
*  Companies like Apple and Nintendo are seeking out alternative locations for production, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=231.0s)]
*  while other companies sit it out, hoping that a deal will come. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=236.0s)]
*  Either way, it's expensive for companies. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUl04wUB_E&t=240.0s)]
