# WSJCoin: To Understand Cryptocurrencies, We Created One
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 03, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM)
*  Cryptocurrencies are not an investment. They're a way of empowering people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=0.0s)]
*  I've been a markets reporter for 10 years, but I've never seen anything nearly as wild [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=6.0s)]
*  as the cryptocurrency frenzy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=21.72s)]
*  Bitcoin has been a wild ride trading now at 18,000 dropping us at nearly 15%. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=24.0s)]
*  Beyond Bitcoin, it seems like everybody wants to start their own cryptocurrency. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=30.0s)]
*  Kodak, Playboy, Venezuela, and many others could have like millions of these different [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=36.0s)]
*  tokens all around the world. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=43.0s)]
*  I've done research, interviewed experts. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=44.0s)]
*  Hey, it's Steve. I got a few questions for you. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=48.0s)]
*  And read a lot. Then I realized that if you really want to understand this crypto craze, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=50.0s)]
*  you kind of have to be part of it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=57.0s)]
*  So why wouldn't we at the Wall Street Journal create our own cryptocurrency? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=59.0s)]
*  But this is very, very exciting. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=64.0s)]
*  And a very good way to explore a little known booming industry. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=67.0s)]
*  Seeking help from eccentric professionals like this crypto miner in Japan. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=71.0s)]
*  And asking many others for advice. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=80.0s)]
*  Really? What are you going to do with this? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=85.0s)]
*  We actually created the WSJ coin. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=88.0s)]
*  My name is Steve Rusalillo and I cover cryptocurrencies for the Wall Street Journal. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=110.0s)]
*  So how do you exactly create a cryptocurrency? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=119.0s)]
*  Where do you start? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=125.0s)]
*  Let's first do what any sophisticated resourceful reporter would do in my situation. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=126.0s)]
*  Google it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=131.0s)]
*  Create your own crypto asset today. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=133.0s)]
*  So these websites allow anyone to create a cryptocurrency in a few clicks. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=137.0s)]
*  They can even help you take the next step. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=143.0s)]
*  Launching and selling your coins to investors through something called an initial coin offering or ICO. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=145.0s)]
*  That's basically an IPO but for cryptocurrencies. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=151.0s)]
*  That seems too simple. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=154.0s)]
*  I need to know what's behind all of this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=157.0s)]
*  And there's one place in the world that has a great reputation for cryptocurrencies. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=159.0s)]
*  Japan, here I come. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=165.0s)]
*  For the past few years, Japan, a country of robots, video games and high technology, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=172.0s)]
*  has been considered to be a true crypto paradise. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=178.0s)]
*  The secretive inventor of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, supposedly comes from Japan. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=181.0s)]
*  And despite this market's numerous setbacks, Mount Gox unexpectedly shut down today. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=187.0s)]
*  The crypto industry here has flourished in recent years, in part thanks to supportive government regulation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=193.0s)]
*  It's such a big business that someone even created a cryptocurrency pop band just for marketing purposes. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=204.0s)]
*  I'm a member of the Bitcoin community. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=223.0s)]
*  One day, I was told that you guys are cryptocurrency girls. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=226.0s)]
*  I was wearing a mask and this maid uniform. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=233.0s)]
*  And suddenly this group started. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=238.0s)]
*  We are trying to create our own cryptocurrency. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=242.0s)]
*  Do you have any advice for us? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=246.0s)]
*  Well, I'm not sure I'm ready for that just yet. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=252.0s)]
*  Before we create our own cryptocurrency, we need to understand why many people think this can really change the world. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=263.0s)]
*  And Japan offers us a glimpse of what a true crypto society looks like. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=271.0s)]
*  I travel to Aizu, a small city north of Tokyo. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=276.0s)]
*  It's a three-hour journey by bullet train. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=281.0s)]
*  Here, people are already experimenting with cryptocurrencies on the ground. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=284.0s)]
*  This is Professor Yasushi Fuji, a blockchain fanatic. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=289.0s)]
*  He drives what he calls a blockchain car, an electric vehicle whose power is automatically paid using Bitcoin. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=293.0s)]
*  Good. Nice to see you. How's everything? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=301.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=303.0s)]
*  These days, when you get lunch at the campus' cafeteria, instead of using cash, you can now pay with Biako, the University of Aizu's own cryptocurrency. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=304.0s)]
*  So what are some of the benefits of this cryptocurrency? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=318.0s)]
*  We can see how the current technology is working. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=331.0s)]
*  The next step is to see what kind of features we can use. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=340.0s)]
*  Following the success of several pilot projects, he is now looking at expanding Biako's network to the local town. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=347.0s)]
*  The value of log data is increasing, so we can see how we can use it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=354.0s)]
*  By seeing the flow of money in the area, we can invest in who is running the money. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=361.0s)]
*  Fuji argues that this way, if an economic crisis erupts, subsidies could be distributed to those in need on the basis of actual data. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=372.0s)]
*  In short, that means a society where money flows easily and quickly, but also a place where the local government knows all about its citizens' spending habits. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=382.0s)]
*  But the small town of Aizu is not the only one aiming at using crypto this way. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=392.0s)]
*  We are going to turn the oil into a reference, an anchor for the movement of the entire economy. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=396.0s)]
*  Playboy came up with a VICE token for porn users. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=426.0s)]
*  There are even coins for businesses like cannabis and dental care. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=430.0s)]
*  Other cryptos have ridiculous names, but people have invested some real money into things called Trump coin, Dogecoin, or Garlic coin. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=434.0s)]
*  I know it sounds dodgy. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=443.0s)]
*  According to experts, proving this industry is legit is one of its biggest challenges. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=445.0s)]
*  I think one of the biggest risks facing the crypto community globally right now is actually the presence of bad apples. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=450.0s)]
*  There was a lot of fraud, there is fraud, and there will be fraud. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=456.0s)]
*  So what can rightfully be called a cryptocurrency? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=460.0s)]
*  Technically, anything that relies on blockchain technology. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=463.0s)]
*  It's basically an open accounting system. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=468.0s)]
*  The reason why it's so popular is that every transaction is recorded by a bunch of computers in different parts of the world. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=470.0s)]
*  In theory, the system is fast and makes fraud and hacks particularly hard because the same information is stored in so many places. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=476.0s)]
*  And famously, it allows you to bypass traditional third parties like banks or central banks. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=485.0s)]
*  For companies, there are a couple more benefits. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=491.0s)]
*  Like in that Japanese university, blockchain makes it easy to amass a lot of user data. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=493.0s)]
*  And even more importantly, companies can use it to raise cash. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=499.0s)]
*  For example, Filecoin, a data storage company, raised $257 million by selling their own coins to investors. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=503.0s)]
*  That's what's called an ICO, or Initial Coin Offer. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=511.0s)]
*  But of course, for all this to work, you need a lot of power. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=515.0s)]
*  A lot of computing power. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=519.0s)]
*  The blockchain relies on people like Asuka Mishiro. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=533.0s)]
*  In the industry, people call him a miner. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=538.0s)]
*  My parents told me to quit at first. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=541.0s)]
*  But after that, I thought it was okay. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=545.0s)]
*  So I showed them my income. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=548.0s)]
*  If that's all I can do, then I'll do it because I have land. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=551.0s)]
*  So I became very supportive. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=557.0s)]
*  I meet the 21-year-old in an old industrial building on the outskirts of Tokyo. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=560.0s)]
*  He recently quit college to expand his mining facility. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=565.0s)]
*  I can't do this business with a college student. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=569.0s)]
*  I'm trying to make the air flow better by lining up in a row. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=579.0s)]
*  The incentive for miners to mine their coins is to sell their coins at a price above the electricity bill. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=599.0s)]
*  When you mine your coins with this machine, the most revenue comes out. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=607.0s)]
*  So I'm doing it now. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=612.0s)]
*  I usually look at the coin's share, so if there's a coin that's likely to rise after this, I dig that one. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=614.0s)]
*  When you create a cryptocurrency, you have to convince this community that your coin is worth mining. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=622.0s)]
*  I'm a miner. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=629.0s)]
*  So we're going to create a WSJ coin. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=633.0s)]
*  Are you willing to mine it? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=635.0s)]
*  And what are the conditions? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=637.0s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=639.0s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=641.0s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=643.0s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=645.0s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=647.0s)]
*  If I get a profit, I'll do mining. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=649.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=680.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is very easy to do. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=682.0s)]
*  It's actually something that I think could be accomplished even within a single day. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=683.0s)]
*  First, you have to choose the type of blockchain you're going to use. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=688.0s)]
*  There are many options nowadays, and they're all different. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=691.0s)]
*  Bitcoin is slow, but widely adopted. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=694.0s)]
*  Ethereum is faster and cheaper to operate. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=697.0s)]
*  Hyperledger is a closed system, completely controlled by the coin's creator. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=700.0s)]
*  For WSJ coin, we're going to use Iroha. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=705.0s)]
*  A blockchain created by Makoto and his team of 43 developers. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=708.0s)]
*  And then choose the name and a logo. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=713.0s)]
*  That's easy. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=716.0s)]
*  So how many of these damn coins should we make? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=718.0s)]
*  I have no idea. How do we figure that out? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=721.0s)]
*  We decided to use the average of the 10 most popular cryptocurrencies worldwide. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=723.0s)]
*  So as you can see, the average calculated is 8.4 billion coins. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=728.0s)]
*  8.4 billion? Sounds good. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=733.0s)]
*  Great. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=736.0s)]
*  We then chose the level of precision of the coin. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=737.0s)]
*  What would you recommend? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=740.0s)]
*  I think 2 is useful because the US dollar is typically used like dollars and cents. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=741.0s)]
*  Phew. Thanks, Makoto. And we're done. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=748.0s)]
*  This is it. All we have to do is push this button and we can create WSJ coin. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=751.0s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=755.0s)]
*  And done. Your currency was created. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=757.0s)]
*  I think we have a coin. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=759.0s)]
*  For now, our 8.4 billion WSJ coins are just lines of code stored on Makoto's private servers. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=761.0s)]
*  Let's see what we could potentially do with them. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=769.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't we buy some drinks? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=772.0s)]
*  So we're going to be able to drink on WSJ's dime or WSJ's coin. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=774.0s)]
*  Not so fast. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=780.0s)]
*  We need him to create a payment system for our currency. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=782.0s)]
*  So first we need to register the bartender as the user in the system. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=785.0s)]
*  Then we can send him money. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=789.0s)]
*  We're with the Wall Street Journal and we just launched our very own cryptocurrency, WSJ coin. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=799.0s)]
*  So we'd like to buy some beer. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=805.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=807.0s)]
*  Can we get beer with WSJ coin? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=808.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=810.0s)]
*  How much is the coin? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=811.0s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=815.0s)]
*  Like any crypto, I basically have to come up with a value. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=817.0s)]
*  The equivalent of one beer. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=820.0s)]
*  And hope that my counterpart will accept it. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=823.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=825.0s)]
*  Great. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=827.0s)]
*  Sending the money is a cumbersome process. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=828.0s)]
*  Makoto spends approximately 45 minutes coding just to create an account for the bartender. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=831.0s)]
*  I'm sweating drops of beer right now. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=837.0s)]
*  We were able to create the currency, register an account. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=840.0s)]
*  Now we just have to transfer our assets and we're done. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=844.0s)]
*  Let's try this. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=847.0s)]
*  So we should decide how many beers we want. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=852.0s)]
*  Two beers? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=854.0s)]
*  So two beers for two coins? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=856.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=858.0s)]
*  So let's go and send it. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=860.0s)]
*  And it's done. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=862.0s)]
*  WSJ coin's first transaction. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=864.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=866.0s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=869.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=875.0s)]
*  We convinced one shop to accept our cryptocurrency. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=877.0s)]
*  But for WSJ coin to truly be successful, we need to do what Bitcoin did. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=880.0s)]
*  Convince people one by one that our currency is credible and has value. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=884.0s)]
*  Hitoshi Taguchi is the head of a major crypto exchange. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=892.0s)]
*  BMM Bitcoin. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=896.0s)]
*  That's like a stock exchange. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=898.0s)]
*  We're going down the drain, okay? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=901.0s)]
*  The stock is plummeting. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=902.0s)]
*  A marketplace where people buy and sell cryptocurrencies. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=903.0s)]
*  Hitoshi says developing a payment system is key to the success of cryptocurrencies. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=907.0s)]
*  That's something all cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin included, are still lacking. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=912.0s)]
*  If we don't use virtual currency as a means of making money in the future, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=918.0s)]
*  the value of virtual currency will be lost. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=926.0s)]
*  WSJ's brand power is very global. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=929.0s)]
*  We will actively consider the possibility of using it as a means of making money in the future. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=934.0s)]
*  That's a deal. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=942.0s)]
*  Back in Hong Kong, it's time to introduce WSJ coin to the crypto community. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=947.0s)]
*  We came to this big crypto conference with more than 1,000 industry experts, entrepreneurs, and investors. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=953.0s)]
*  I'm rich enough never to work again in my life. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=959.0s)]
*  We're looking for people who'd be interested in WSJ coin. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=962.0s)]
*  Let's see what people say. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=965.0s)]
*  What's your view of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=968.0s)]
*  Cryptocurrency is going to change the world. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=972.0s)]
*  It's like new internet, so it's going to grow bigger and bigger. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=974.0s)]
*  There is no borders for Bitcoin. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=977.0s)]
*  Each huge business will have their own tokens. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=979.0s)]
*  All right, you got it. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=982.0s)]
*  People here love cryptocurrencies. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=984.0s)]
*  Are they going to like ours? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=986.0s)]
*  At the Wall Street Journal, we're in the process of creating WSJ coin. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=987.0s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=993.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=995.0s)]
*  That is cool. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=996.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=998.0s)]
*  It's one of the biggest initiatives by an existing company. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=999.0s)]
*  Honestly, the pitch is going very well. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1002.0s)]
*  Steven, are you? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1005.0s)]
*  Wow, your cap is very beautiful. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1008.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1010.0s)]
*  Would you buy it? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1011.0s)]
*  Would I buy it? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1013.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1014.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1015.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1016.0s)]
*  What does the coin do? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1017.0s)]
*  We're trying to iron out exactly the business model that we want to do. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1018.0s)]
*  We want people to buy subscriptions using our new tokens. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1022.0s)]
*  And we think that this is a good way to attract a new audience. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1026.0s)]
*  So, would you buy it? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1029.0s)]
*  No. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1030.0s)]
*  Yeah, I guess I need to say yes in front of our cameras, right? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1032.0s)]
*  No. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1036.0s)]
*  Sorry, but no. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1037.0s)]
*  Many people are trying to apply blockchain to whatever comes to their mind, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1038.0s)]
*  simply because there's a hype around it. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1043.0s)]
*  I think you have to think about whether the technology actually brings something to the table [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1045.0s)]
*  and is useful for that kind of industry. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1050.0s)]
*  And there are projects out there where even I do have trouble sometimes [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1053.0s)]
*  understanding why they now need blockchain all of a sudden. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1057.0s)]
*  And as an investor, I think you should be on the lookout for those that have a practical application. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1060.0s)]
*  In other words, the more people are convinced a currency is useful, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1065.0s)]
*  the more likely its value will increase. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1069.0s)]
*  There's one more thing we can do to promote our coin. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1072.0s)]
*  We're going to get ourselves a physical coin. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1075.0s)]
*  True, that's useless, but that's what a lot of people do in the virtual currency universe. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1078.0s)]
*  Oh my. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1089.0s)]
*  What a sweet looking coin. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1091.0s)]
*  Isn't it beautiful? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1095.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't you buy this now? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1096.0s)]
*  I decided to target my audience. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1111.0s)]
*  Here I am at the WSJ's annual tech conference in Hong Kong. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1113.0s)]
*  Will WSJ coin save the newspaper industry? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1117.0s)]
*  There are about 150 people in this room right here eating dinner. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1126.0s)]
*  I am going to pitch WSJ coin. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1131.0s)]
*  In case you can't tell, I'm just a little bit nervous. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1133.0s)]
*  A lot of important people over there. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1136.0s)]
*  I'm hoping it goes really well. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1138.0s)]
*  Fingers crossed. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1140.0s)]
*  You all were distributed WSJ coins. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1143.0s)]
*  These are prototypes, just to be perfectly clear. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1145.0s)]
*  Is there a use case for the journalism industry and the media industry to have a token? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1148.0s)]
*  The panelists think WSJ coin could revolutionize the way we pay for news. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1154.0s)]
*  I don't live in the States. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1159.0s)]
*  I don't have a subscription and I wanted to get access to an article. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1160.0s)]
*  And often, you know, I get blocked by US media and I have to whip out my credit card, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1163.0s)]
*  which is annoying for like a small per article payment. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1167.0s)]
*  So cryptocurrencies or digital currencies where microtransactions make sense [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1170.0s)]
*  is a great use case for paywalls. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1175.0s)]
*  Even the former CTO of Ripple, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1178.0s)]
*  one of the world's largest cryptocurrency companies, agrees with this. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1180.0s)]
*  If you lower the cost of moving money around, you know, the entire economy changes [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1184.0s)]
*  and the entire like how do I pay for a news article online changes. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1189.0s)]
*  You know, I could pay suddenly just by being on the website [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1194.0s)]
*  and my browser streams payments in the background. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1197.0s)]
*  This has been great. Thank you both so very much. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1203.0s)]
*  Thanks for having us. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1205.0s)]
*  So should we officially launch WSJ coin? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1210.0s)]
*  You know, actually sell the coins to investors? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1213.0s)]
*  Well, it's not that simple. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1216.0s)]
*  We have a process at the Wall Street Journal. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1219.0s)]
*  The standards and ethics group at the Wall Street Journal ensures our commitment [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1221.0s)]
*  to the highest journalistic principles. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1225.0s)]
*  There's one person. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1227.0s)]
*  He's an institution here and he has to approve any of our projects [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1228.0s)]
*  that raise ethical questions. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1232.0s)]
*  My name is Neil Lipschutz and I'm the editor for the WSJ. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1234.0s)]
*  We had a few conversations with him. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1237.0s)]
*  So, Neil, WSJ coin, our cryptocurrency, can we launch it? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1242.0s)]
*  This could be a way to save the newspaper industry. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1246.0s)]
*  Sorry, Steve, no. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1249.0s)]
*  We're not in the business of getting into the cryptocurrency world. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1251.0s)]
*  We're here to report it and to explain it. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1255.0s)]
*  Just like we report on banks, we don't go out and start a bank. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1257.0s)]
*  We're here to report on the fact that we're not in the business of getting into the cryptocurrency world. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1260.0s)]
*  We're not going to create a currency. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1265.0s)]
*  A lot of crypto players have actually criticized journalists [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1268.0s)]
*  because they say that they are not involved in the industry. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1272.0s)]
*  And if you don't own any crypto, you don't necessarily have the knowledge or expertise [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1275.0s)]
*  that people who are in the industry do have. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1279.0s)]
*  If we had a competing entity in the very area that we cover, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1283.0s)]
*  I think people could reasonably lose some trust in our objectivity. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1289.0s)]
*  Well, what can I say to that? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1294.0s)]
*  I asked Makuto to shut it down. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1298.0s)]
*  Right, too bad. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1303.0s)]
*  With WSJ coin, I could have made so much money like all these crypto millionaires. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1304.0s)]
*  Boy, is officially a Bitcoin millionaire. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1310.0s)]
*  This is insane, y'all. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1313.0s)]
*  They drive fancy cars. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1315.0s)]
*  They party for days on cruise ships. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1317.0s)]
*  People call me the crypto captain. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1319.0s)]
*  They just live the good life. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1321.0s)]
*  Bitcoin pays for the bet. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1323.0s)]
*  I could have been one of them. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1325.0s)]
*  I could have made this company rich, really rich. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1331.0s)]
*  Or we could have lost everything. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1337.0s)]
*  That happens to a lot of people in the crypto industry. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1339.0s)]
*  Or we could have lost everything. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1342.0s)]
*  That happens to a lot of people in the crypto industry. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1344.0s)]
*  Bitcoin tumbling again. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1347.0s)]
*  Prices surge and plunge like crazy. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1348.0s)]
*  The bear market will continue for digital currencies. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1351.0s)]
*  You bet. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1353.0s)]
*  Exchanges get hacked. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1354.0s)]
*  Many people lose money. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1355.0s)]
*  Regulation is still weak. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1358.0s)]
*  And there's still really almost no protection for investors. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1360.0s)]
*  Bitcoin is a bubble. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1363.0s)]
*  This is really a wild world. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1364.0s)]
*  It was awesome seeing how this crypto universe works [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1367.0s)]
*  and meeting all these people. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1370.0s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1373.0s)]
*  After all, I'm not sure I want to be part of this. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1374.0s)]
*  For the time being, I'll stick to journalism. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1377.0s)]
*  So this is the moment of truth. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1387.0s)]
*  Let's push the button. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1389.0s)]
*  So now it's reading it. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1392.0s)]
*  Oh, what the hell? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1393.0s)]
*  At the Wall Street Journal, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1401.0s)]
*  we're going to launch our own cryptocurrency. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1403.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1408.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1409.0s)]
*  So our own token. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1410.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1412.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnnsC4l2yM&t=1413.0s)]
