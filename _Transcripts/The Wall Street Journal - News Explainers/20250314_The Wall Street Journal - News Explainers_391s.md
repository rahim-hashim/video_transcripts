Video Description: Intel is facing tough times after its stock plunged 60% in 2024 and it ousted its CEO Pat Gelsinger. Lip-Bu Tan has been tapped as new CEO for the semiconductor company as it has struggled with both chip manufacturing and chip designing. Unlike Intel, companies specialized in either designing chips–like AMD or Nvidia–or manufacturing chips–like TSMC. 

WSJ explains how a mistake Intel made in the mid 2000s has snowballed into an overwhelming obstacle for the tech company that Lip-Bu Tan will have to face.

# Intel Burned $16B Last Year. Can Its New CEO Save the Company? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU)
*  After nearly 25 years as the world's largest chipmaker, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=0.0s)]
*  Intel is struggling. Look at the yellow bars on this chart. That's the company's cash flow. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  It burned through almost $16 billion last year. It's indicative of a big problem on one side of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=13.76s)]
*  Intel's business. Chip manufacturing. But there's a problem with the other side, chip designing, too. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=20.16s)]
*  You can see it in this line, which shows Intel's market cap. And it may not look that bad. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=27.36s)]
*  But these lines show its competitors. Now, new CEO Lip Bhutan has been tasked with fixing both [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=33.36s)]
*  sides of Intel's business. There are things you can do, but it's going to be incremental [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=40.88s)]
*  and it's going to be extremely risky. Here's how a mistake the company made [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=46.16s)]
*  decades ago has snowballed into an overwhelming obstacle that Lip Bhutan will have to face. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=49.92s)]
*  Since it was founded in 1968, Intel dominated the chip market. Inside this package is a chip of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=57.68s)]
*  silicon, which provides the electrical equivalent of many transistors, resistors, and diodes. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=63.92s)]
*  Basically, they had a technological monopoly. There were a few other competitors. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=70.4s)]
*  The company churned out industry standard after industry standard of CPUs, or central processing [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=75.12s)]
*  units. They're essentially the brains of a computer. Now, anyone can have all the brain power they want, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  just look for a PC with an Intel processor inside. By 1992, it became the world's largest chipmaker [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=86.96s)]
*  by revenue, according to the company. By 1997, its chips served as the brains of 84% of the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=93.28s)]
*  world's computers. And in 2000, the stock hit an all time high. Intel was the king of chips. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=100.08s)]
*  But while the company was riding high, the rest of the industry was making a change. By the 2010s, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=106.88s)]
*  it had split. Most companies specialized in either designing chips like AMD or Nvidia, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=113.2s)]
*  or manufacturing chips like TSMC. That shift happened for two main reasons. One is that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=119.12s)]
*  as the manufacturing technology became increasingly sophisticated, the equipment needed [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  to support that to cut things that small, was costing one, two billions easily. This meant that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=130.56s)]
*  foreign manufacturers like TSMC were able to produce chips cheaper and faster with low cost [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=136.72s)]
*  labor and fewer regulations. The second reason, Intel's development slowed down. Before Intel was [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=142.8s)]
*  unquestionably number one, the power of their chips. So they were making things around 14 [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=149.68s)]
*  nanometers. But every year, they were able to upgrade their technology every 18 months or so. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=154.64s)]
*  But between 2014 and 2020, that cycle slowed down significantly, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=160.64s)]
*  and TSMC and Samsung ended up catching up to them. By 2017, experts said that competitor CPUs were [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=167.04s)]
*  less expensive and faster than Intel's. And in 2021, in the midst of the semiconductor shortage, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=173.6s)]
*  global supply chain challenges, and associated rising costs faced by American families today, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=180.56s)]
*  this guy, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, made two massive financial moves that are still weighing [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=187.2s)]
*  on the company today. With funding committed from the Chips Act, Intel broke ground on two new [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=193.2s)]
*  factories in Arizona worth $20 billion. Officials thought that money attracts money. It attracts [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=198.64s)]
*  investment. It demonstrates we're all in. The next year, it started building a mega site in Ohio [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=206.32s)]
*  estimated to cost $100 billion when complete. These uncompleted factories will create challenges [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=212.88s)]
*  that Liputon will have to deal with. I mean, the goal is you have to be [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=219.68s)]
*  technologically competitive in foundry business. You have to be able to compete with TSMC. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  It's uncertain whether you can do that. But without taking back the technological leadership, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=229.12s)]
*  all these investments do not make any sense. Last year, the company doubled down on its plan, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=235.68s)]
*  announcing a $36 billion upgrade to existing factories in Oregon. This massive investment [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=241.6s)]
*  means that Intel's assets are worth more than its market value. And now it's engaged in talks [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=247.12s)]
*  with competitors like TSMC to spin off the manufacturing side. You face huge pressure [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=252.48s)]
*  to spin off, especially because this very heavy asset side of the manufacturing, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=258.88s)]
*  when it comes to valuation side of things, it's dragging down the more profitable [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=265.36s)]
*  asset like design side of things. And all of this focus on bringing chip manufacturing to America [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=269.28s)]
*  left Intel vulnerable on the design side. While Intel was busy building factories, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=274.96s)]
*  a new trend was emerging in the industry. Artificial intelligence, high demands for AI [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=280.4s)]
*  chips. Everybody's talking about AI. But Intel didn't specialize in GPUs or graphic processing [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  units necessary for AI. Intel's architecture, the design philosophy is being really good at one [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=291.44s)]
*  complex computation. GPU was let me do lots of simple computations in parallel. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=298.08s)]
*  Their existing capabilities weren't naturally compatible with the GPU revolution. Sales [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=304.64s)]
*  deteriorated. The company's AI product, Gaudi, didn't perform. You won't be making the outline [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=310.88s)]
*  target of $500 million in sales for this fiscal year or calendar year. Why? The AI world has [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=318.08s)]
*  moved very rapidly and innovating very quickly. And the robustness and the completeness of the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=324.4s)]
*  Gaudi software stack hasn't been as great. In December, Gelsinger was ousted from his role, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=330.88s)]
*  leaving the company in turmoil. What they will try to do, whether it's successful or not, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  is very uncertain. So they will try to be competitive in the foundry manufacturing space. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=341.76s)]
*  It takes very aggressive investments. And whether the investors are patient enough or willing to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=346.23999999999995s)]
*  tolerate that, that's a big question mark. And the investors are now being tested. Intel [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=352.8s)]
*  reported the largest loss in their 56 years of business. But Tan isn't deterred. He said, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  I am joining because I believe with every fiber of my being that we have what it takes to win. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=365.68s)]
*  Let's not underestimate the success of Intel so far. I mean, let's remember Apple almost went [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=371.04s)]
*  bankrupt. But whether they will stage a successful turnaround, anybody who says that with conviction, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=375.6s)]
*  I'm a little bit skeptical. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdMyAK41oU&t=381.36s)]
