# New Hampshire Primary: Nikki Haley’s Last Chance to Beat Donald Trump? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8)
*  The New Hampshire primary is just around the corner. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=0.0s)]
*  This is potentially a pivotal moment in the Republican primary. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=3.44s)]
*  For Nikki Haley, New Hampshire could be her best and last chance to persuade voters that [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  she's a better alternative to Donald Trump. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=12.4s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=15.16s)]
*  The first primary of the 2024 election season is now a one-on-one battle. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=17.68s)]
*  After Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suspended his presidential bid two days before the election [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=22.64s)]
*  and endorsed former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=27.84s)]
*  I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=30.32s)]
*  if we don't have a clear path to victory. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=34.8s)]
*  The New Hampshire primary comes off the heels of the Republican caucuses in Iowa, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=37.28s)]
*  where Trump won by a record-breaking margin, all but cementing his position as the front-runner [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=41.92s)]
*  for the party's nomination. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  We want to thank the great people of Iowa. Thank you. We love you all. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  But unlike Iowa, New Hampshire has a more moderate electorate, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=54.4s)]
*  and large numbers of independents are allowed to vote in the state's GOP primary. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=58.16s)]
*  New Hampshire is much more independent-minded, much more secular. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=63.2s)]
*  This has always been a state where the electorate was much more friendly to the appeal of someone [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=66.64s)]
*  like Nikki Haley, who combines a sort of conservative stance on taxes and spending [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=71.44s)]
*  with conservative positions on foreign policy and a pitch that's about electability. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=76.88s)]
*  There's a substantial block of Democratic-leaning independents [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=82.0s)]
*  who might like to take the nomination away from Donald Trump. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=85.44s)]
*  There's a substantial block of moderate conservatives or conservative-leaning independents. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=88.64s)]
*  All of these moderate voters are a potential asset for a candidate like Nikki Haley. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=93.92s)]
*  With DeSantis out of the race, Haley has the opportunity to present herself [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=99.68s)]
*  as the better and now only alternative to Trump. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=103.92s)]
*  It has been the conventional wisdom that the only way Trump could be beaten [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=107.2s)]
*  is if he were one-on-one with a single alternative, giving voters that binary choice. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=110.88s)]
*  Either it's Trump or it's not. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=116.0s)]
*  Do we want more of the same or do you want something different? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  And more of the same isn't just Joe Biden. More of the same is also Donald Trump. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  Haley believes she already has momentum going into the New Hampshire primary. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=127.84s)]
*  She has the endorsement of the very popular Republican governor of New Hampshire, Chris [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=132.32s)]
*  Sununu, who's been very outspoken against Trump and what he represents. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=136.88s)]
*  Haley is also likely to scoop up some supporters of former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=142.16s)]
*  an avid Trump critic who dropped out of the race just days before the Iowa caucuses. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=147.2s)]
*  However, Trump remains dominant in polls in New Hampshire and the states to follow for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=152.88s)]
*  future primaries. With DeSantis endorsing Trump after suspending his campaign, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=157.68s)]
*  the support he was drawing in New Hampshire will likely go to Trump, widening his lead. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=163.36s)]
*  Another decisive victory could make the former president nearly impossible to stop. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=168.72000000000003s)]
*  From the perspective of the Trump campaign, this is already over. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=173.84s)]
*  You have a lot of Trump's allies and campaign officials saying, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=176.72000000000003s)]
*  it's time to unite the Republican Party. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=180.88000000000002s)]
*  Haley has tried to toe this very delicate line of, on the one hand, articulating what she [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=183.44000000000003s)]
*  believes are valid criticisms of Trump, while not angering the voters who still think that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=189.12s)]
*  Trump was a good president and like him in a lot of ways. And so for her, it's really New Hampshire [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=193.84s)]
*  that's do or die. She needs to either win or show that she can come close to Donald Trump [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=199.84s)]
*  to give her a reason to keep going forward. It's still early in the 2024 presidential [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=204.88s)]
*  campaign season, with many more state primaries and caucuses to go ahead of November's election. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=209.6s)]
*  But New Hampshire will likely set the tone for another major upcoming test, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=215.76s)]
*  the South Carolina primary. Trump looks very strong throughout the South, including in South [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=219.84s)]
*  Carolina. We've seen him get huge reception when he's gone down there to campaign. So although it [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=225.04s)]
*  is Nikki Haley's home state, where she was a popular governor, it's viewed as an uphill battle [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=230.16s)]
*  for all the non-Trump candidates. If Haley is able to come close or defeat Trump in New Hampshire, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=235.28s)]
*  she really looks like much more of a force in this campaign. And it starts to look like a real [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=240.16s)]
*  contest. Now she still has an uphill battle in South Carolina, but at least it looks like an actual battle. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1o32rwRcQ8&t=245.52s)]
