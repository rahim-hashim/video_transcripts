# How Trump’s Charges Compare to This Past Politician's Scandal | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU)
*  Donald Trump is the first former president to be charged with a crime, but he isn't [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=0.0s)]
*  the first former presidential candidate to be indicted. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=4.36s)]
*  Or for that indictment to involve a hush money payment. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=7.92s)]
*  Just over 10 years ago, Democrat John Edwards stood trial for money and gifts given to his mistress. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=11.24s)]
*  There's nothing illegal about giving somebody hush money not to talk about it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=16.68s)]
*  If it was done specifically for the purpose of promoting your candidacy for a federal office, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=20.12s)]
*  that's where the problem comes in. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=26.64s)]
*  Here's how the two cases compare, and what we can learn about the potential strengths [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=28.720000000000002s)]
*  and weaknesses of the one against Trump from the other. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  Let's start with what happened with John Edwards. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  A senator from North Carolina, he became John Kerry's 2004 running mate, before running [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=39.64s)]
*  in the 2008 presidential primary against Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=44.44s)]
*  He did okay in Iowa, but quickly dropped out. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=49.52s)]
*  It's time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=52.32s)]
*  That year, tabloid stories surfaced about him having a child from an affair, which after [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=61.76s)]
*  two years of denying, he admitted to. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=66.64s)]
*  The scandal had everything. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=71.72s)]
*  Could be the biggest political sex scandal of our generation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=73.48s)]
*  I just turned him and said, you're so hot. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=76.4s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of dollars given to him by supporters. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=78.08s)]
*  By jet flights and luxury hotel rooms. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=81.56s)]
*  While his wife was battling terminal cancer. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=83.48s)]
*  John Edwards' sex tape details revealed. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=85.72s)]
*  It was a huge scandal at the time. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=89.16s)]
*  People loved Elizabeth Edwards. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=91.48s)]
*  Elizabeth Edwards really helped John Edwards' reputation mammothly. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=92.76s)]
*  So they really sold themselves as a loving, everyday American family. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=97.08s)]
*  Here's what the Justice Department said happened during the campaign. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=103.36s)]
*  Campaign worker Riel Hunter, pregnant with John Edwards' daughter while his wife Elizabeth [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=106.76s)]
*  was dying of cancer, was given cash, luxury hotel stays, apartments, and rides on private [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  planes by a wealthy member of his campaign and a wealthy donor to be kept out of sight. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=116.2s)]
*  These were also given to a close aide who falsely claimed to be the baby's father. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=121.72s)]
*  None of this money came directly through the campaign or Edwards himself. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=126.44s)]
*  Prosecutors argued Edwards orchestrated this web of money and that the payments were made [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=131.32s)]
*  to help his campaign. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=135.52s)]
*  A federal grand jury indicted Edwards on six federal counts of campaign finance law violations. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=137.2s)]
*  John Edwards is a lousy human being, but I think this is a really lousy and flimsy criminal case. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=142.72s)]
*  Melanie Sloan founded this government accountability group and still works in ethics and campaign law. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=148.64s)]
*  She followed the Edwards trial closely. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=153.92s)]
*  There was no evidence that John Edwards personally gave the money. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=155.83999999999997s)]
*  Regardless of whether that had happened, there still would have been the question about why. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  Is the money a campaign donation? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=163.92s)]
*  Is it being spent to advance your candidacy or is it money being spent to hush this up for some other reason, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=166.24s)]
*  i.e. to protect your family? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  While I do not believe I did anything illegal or ever thought I was doing anything illegal, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  I did an awful, awful lot that was wrong. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  New York prosecutors argue with Trump the reason was clearly because of the 2016 election. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=186.0s)]
*  Trump denies any wrongdoing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  Here's what prosecutors say happened. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=193.84s)]
*  In 2016, porn star Stormy Daniels' lawyer went to the National Enquirer. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=196.32s)]
*  Yes, that same tabloid, to sell her story about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump from a decade prior. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  The CEO of the tabloid's publisher, David Pecker, was able to connect her with Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  who eventually paid her $130,000 to keep quiet. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=213.92s)]
*  Cohen was later reimbursed by submitting monthly invoices for legal services, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=218.0s)]
*  which were paid by Trump through the Trump Organization. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=222.48s)]
*  New York prosecutors say those payment records were false business records. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=225.44s)]
*  The 34 charges come out of the same set of facts. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  Each time there's an invoice and each time there's a payment and each time there's a bookkeeping record, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=232.88s)]
*  that is all the crime of falsifying the business records in order to cover up a crime. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=237.83999999999997s)]
*  With Edwards' case, this donor had died and this one was 100 and never testified. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=243.76s)]
*  A jury acquitted him on one charge and deadlocked on another five. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=249.76s)]
*  So the trial ended in a mistrial. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=253.84s)]
*  Jurors said there wasn't enough evidence tying him to the money. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=256.08s)]
*  We all thought that he knew, but there just was not the evidence there to prove it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=259.52s)]
*  It was just a lack of evidence. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=264.32s)]
*  With Trump, prosecutors say they have evidence that he was involved in the payments, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=266.88s)]
*  besides Trump's name and signature on the checks, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=271.28s)]
*  and that the intent of the payments was to help his campaign. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=274.0s)]
*  Cohen has already pleaded guilty and served time in jail for these payments being campaign-related. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=277.84s)]
*  And prosecutors say Trump directed Cohen to delay Daniels' payment until after the election, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=283.67999999999995s)]
*  because then it would not matter if the story becomes public. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=289.44s)]
*  Prosecutors also point to a similar payment made to another woman [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=292.96s)]
*  who alleged she had a sexual encounter with Trump, Karen McDougall. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=296.55999999999995s)]
*  They say Pecker and Cohen worked out a deal that ultimately paid McDougall $150,000 for her silence. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=300.32s)]
*  And that there are audio recordings of Trump and Cohen discussing this arrangement. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=307.12s)]
*  Testimony from Pecker says he made the connections to the two women to ensure [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=311.92s)]
*  no damaging allegations would be published before the election, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=316.16s)]
*  and thereby influence that election. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=319.68s)]
*  The indictment and statement of facts, particularly, do not suggest in any way, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=322.32s)]
*  shape or form that this was ever about hiding it from his wife. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=326.24s)]
*  In fact, they make it very, very clear that what they want to do [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=329.68s)]
*  is hide it during the course of the presidential election. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=332.8s)]
*  Federal prosecutors, when charging Cohen in 2019, declined to indict Trump, who was still in office. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=335.76s)]
*  These charges were filed in a New York state court. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=342.47999999999996s)]
*  Experts like Sloan argue that this case may not even be as strong as the one against Edwards, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=345.68s)]
*  which was in federal court, even with these connections. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't think this is a slam dunk by any means. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  The fact that it's not being a federal case, that it's actually not being done by the Justice [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=356.24s)]
*  Department when you have a federal campaign finance law and that it's being bootstrapped [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  into a state court that is unprecedented. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=363.52s)]
*  Trump pleaded not guilty to all 34 charges. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=366.56s)]
*  He denies the alleged sexual encounters. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=369.68s)]
*  This fake case was brought only to interfere with the upcoming 2024 election, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  and it should be dropped immediately. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=378.32s)]
*  He's not likely to face jail time if convicted, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=382.24s)]
*  and the trial, if it happens, isn't expected to move quickly. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  The next court date is in December of 2023. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=388.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPmLLaAXezU&t=393.52s)]
