# How Trump and Biden’s Documents Should Have Been Handled | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo)
*  President Clinton ended his two terms with 78 million pages of official records. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=0.0s)]
*  President Bush had 40 million pages. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=5.86s)]
*  President Obama, 30 million. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=8.76s)]
*  Transcripts, letters, tweets, photos, classified documents. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=11.22s)]
*  All of these are supposed to go to the National Archives. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=15.92s)]
*  Supposed to. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=19.8s)]
*  FBI agencies classified records from former President Trump's home. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=20.8s)]
*  Classified documents from President Biden's time as vice president. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=24.7s)]
*  Now the Justice Department is investigating why and how classified documents got to the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=28.96s)]
*  home of former President Donald Trump and to the home and office of President Biden [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=33.88s)]
*  after he served as vice president. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=38.14s)]
*  Here's how records are handled when a president leaves office. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=40.24s)]
*  And how some might fall through the cracks. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=43.4s)]
*  Legally, the president, or vice president, are the custodians of public records they [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=46.68s)]
*  create while in office. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=51.16s)]
*  And on the last day of their term, they are supposed to move all of it to the National Archives. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  When you walk into the White House after a new president is elected, the White House [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=58.16s)]
*  is empty. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=62.64s)]
*  The offices are empty. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=64.0s)]
*  The computers are wiped clean. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=65.44s)]
*  There's no documents. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  There's no files. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=68.92s)]
*  It's just empty. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=70.52s)]
*  David Marchik has written about the history of presidential transitions and was involved [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=71.84s)]
*  in President Biden's transition in 2020 and worked in Clinton's 1992 White House. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=76.2s)]
*  I was young and I had a lot more hair. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=81.2s)]
*  When those literal boxes of records are moved, the archives become the custodian. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=84.2s)]
*  Even for things like the president and vice president's social media accounts. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=89.26s)]
*  The archives keep all of the classified documents in a secure location and keep the rest at [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=93.4s)]
*  a former president's presidential library or a storage area until it's established. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=98.86s)]
*  At President Kennedy's library, you can see his notes and doodles from meetings at the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=103.74000000000001s)]
*  Cuba Missile Crisis. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  At President Reagan's, you can see artifacts from his attempted assassination. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=109.58s)]
*  At President Bush's, you can see his notes from his speech announcing, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=113.92s)]
*  Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center in an apparent terrorist attack [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=117.64s)]
*  on our country. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=124.76s)]
*  Preserving a president's records is a big deal. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=126.72s)]
*  It's the law and it's also important so that future researchers, scholars, historians, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=130.12s)]
*  documentarians can get access to these documents to document history, to learn from president's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=135.88s)]
*  successes and mistakes and to avoid those mistakes in the future. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=141.96s)]
*  Which is why it's a law that every record that deals with the president's work in office [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=145.96s)]
*  must be sent to the archives. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  But it's the president's staff that is actually in charge of doing that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=153.08s)]
*  This is where things can get messy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=157.06s)]
*  The archives just offer guidance. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=159.06s)]
*  They aren't checking these boxes leaving the White House. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=161.10000000000002s)]
*  The challenge is people in the White House work up until January 20th. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=163.94s)]
*  National security issues don't stop because there's a new president. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=169.54s)]
*  These people are busy, they're exhausted, they're trying to figure out their future, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=172.64s)]
*  they're trying to do their current job. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=177.7s)]
*  And you add to that the burden of preserving all their documents. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=183.56s)]
*  A person familiar with the classified documents found on premises used by Biden told the Wall [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=184.56s)]
*  Street Journal that one was related to a trip to Ukraine he took a few days before his vice [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=189.29999999999998s)]
*  presidential term ended. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=193.88s)]
*  He was just one stop in a hectic travel itinerary during the last two weeks before the transition. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=195.48s)]
*  I'll be vice president of the United States for 48 more hours. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=200.73999999999998s)]
*  When a president travels, their staff goes with them. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=204.32s)]
*  That means the staff's not in the office to preserve the records. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  And it just adds to the challenge, it adds to the pressure, and it reduces the amount [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=210.72s)]
*  of time staff has to preserve their records. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=214.12s)]
*  Trump's last days were also chaotic. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  Not because of travel, but because he was in the middle of his second impeachment. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=219.94s)]
*  Aides at the time said they delayed packing because of Trump's attempts to overturn [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=224.1s)]
*  the election. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=227.85999999999999s)]
*  The White House also typically sends records to the archives throughout the administration [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=229.12s)]
*  as they are done with them. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=233.62s)]
*  So it's not a scramble to send all four years of records all at once. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=235.48s)]
*  An archives official said at an event in January of 2021 that didn't really happen with Trump. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=239.78s)]
*  Usually by transition time, we've got the paper, we've got a majority of the paper [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=245.66s)]
*  records already in our physical custody. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=249.5s)]
*  We really couldn't start picking up until January. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=251.58s)]
*  If you're part of a White House where the president has lost the election, it's a little [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=254.38000000000002s)]
*  more chaotic, a little more stressed, and staff start to thin out during this transition [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=260.54s)]
*  period. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=266.98s)]
*  And so the people that are left there on January 20th at noon are usually a very, very few [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=267.98s)]
*  people standing, and they have a big burden. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=273.42s)]
*  Typically if presidential public records are found after the end of a presidency, their [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=276.98s)]
*  records return to the archives. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=281.18s)]
*  But they're not normally classified. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=283.04s)]
*  Trump's records investigation centers around a number of different kinds of records, not [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  just classified ones. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=290.14s)]
*  The investigation only began when the archives realized they were missing important ones, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=291.78000000000003s)]
*  like correspondence between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=296.46000000000004s)]
*  Trump's team failed to hand those over, resulting in a search that led to the discovery of numerous [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=300.62s)]
*  classified documents. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=305.26s)]
*  Biden's investigation focuses only on classified documents that were found at a private office [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=307.5s)]
*  and his home. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=312.3s)]
*  While the Justice Department is investigating any wrongdoing, the Archives' goal has remained [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=313.54s)]
*  the same. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=318.34s)]
*  Make sure they have all these public records. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjwYxcDoXmo&t=319.5s)]
