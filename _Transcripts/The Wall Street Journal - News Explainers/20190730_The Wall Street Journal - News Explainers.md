# What the FTC's Crackdown on Facebook Means for User Data  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 30, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg)
*  In July, the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook for $5 billion for violating users' privacy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the largest fine the FTC has ever levied against a business. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=6.72s)]
*  In 2012, the commission sued Facebook for misleading consumers about third-party access to user data. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=11.44s)]
*  And more recently, the FTC found that Facebook was again sharing data with third-party companies, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=17.84s)]
*  even though many consumers had requested that their data remain private. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=23.36s)]
*  The settlement puts Facebook under more intense scrutiny from the commission. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=27.68s)]
*  Here's how the FTC says the rules for Facebook could protect consumers. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=31.36s)]
*  Change number one. Third-party apps will find it harder to get at your data. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=35.92s)]
*  The settlement will force Facebook to increase its management of third-party developers. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=40.72s)]
*  Facebook must now terminate developer access to user information [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  if that developer can't justify their need for that data. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=48.64s)]
*  Change number two. Facebook will need your active consent to keep your facial recognition data. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=52.32s)]
*  The FTC writes that the company must delete any existing facial recognition data within 90 days of the order, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=58.96s)]
*  unless the company obtains users' affirmative consent to use it on templates in the future. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=65.2s)]
*  Change number three. Facebook can't use your phone number for its advertising business without your consent. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=70.64s)]
*  Has Facebook ever requested that you add a phone number for added security? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=76.48s)]
*  It turns out Facebook may have used it to help sell ads. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=80.64s)]
*  The new FTC order mandates that any given number in the guise of enhanced security [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=85.84s)]
*  may not be shared with advertisers or other third parties. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=90.48s)]
*  Change number four. Facebook must quickly notify authorities when data has been compromised. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=95.2s)]
*  The order also mandates that Facebook increase transparency when data of 500 or more users has [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=101.04s)]
*  been compromised. Facebook has to deliver notice within 30 days of the company's discovery of the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=106.64s)]
*  incident, alongside a description of steps taken to remediate the issue. The order will not resolve [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=112.0s)]
*  every issue that consumers may have with Facebook. In a press hearing, multiple FTC representatives [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=118.24s)]
*  stress that changes may not be immediately obvious. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=123.92s)]
*  Some at the FTC say the restrictions don't go far enough. One commissioner said that the settlement [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=136.64s)]
*  imposes no meaningful changes on the systems that led to these violations. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=146.48s)]
*  The FTC order is narrowly focused on Facebook and more limited in scope than Europe's General Data [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  Protection Regulation, or GDPR. That's because the U.S. doesn't have a comprehensive privacy [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=156.88s)]
*  protection law, FTC officials say. For that reason, FTC officials say they can't do much to limit the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=162.64s)]
*  kinds of data Facebook's collecting. Instead, they have to focus on making sure that Facebook [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=169.11999999999998s)]
*  doesn't continue misleading consumers about how their data is being used. In a press release, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  Facebook said that the settlement will, quote, mark a sharper turn toward privacy on a different [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  scale than anything we've done in the past. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9u_odlZkg&t=184.0s)]
