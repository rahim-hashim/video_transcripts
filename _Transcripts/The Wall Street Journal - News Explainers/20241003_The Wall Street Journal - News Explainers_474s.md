Video Description: Project 2025–a once obscure conservative policy book—has emerged as a defining element of the 2024 presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. The former president has gone to great lengths to distance himself from the far-right policy playbook, while it has become a political lightning rod for the Democrats.

WSJ takes an inside look at how the controversial agenda is transforming campaign strategies and voter decisions.

# Why the Presidential Race Is Fixating on Project 2025 Now | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8)
*  This is Project 2025. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=0.0s)]
*  A radical agenda. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=2.2s)]
*  The extreme mega-Republican effort. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=4.44s)]
*  To return America to a dark past. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=7.2s)]
*  Project 2025 has grown into one of the most hotly debated controversies of the presidential race. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=10.44s)]
*  It has become a rallying cry for Democrats, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=16.44s)]
*  while Donald Trump has distanced himself from the far-right policy playbook. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=18.96s)]
*  I have nothing to do with Project 2025. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=22.84s)]
*  Here's an inside look at how Project 2025 is shifting campaign strategies [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=26.16s)]
*  and voter decisions ahead of the election. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=30.96s)]
*  Project 2025 is a conservative governing blueprint for a future Republican administration. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=35.24s)]
*  It gained little notice when it was first published in 2023 by the Heritage Foundation, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=40.6s)]
*  a conservative policy group. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  But more than a year later, the document went viral. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=47.2s)]
*  Project 2025. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=50.28s)]
*  It's a blueprint for a radical far-right takeover of everything in the U.S. government. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=51.72s)]
*  And everyone's talking about it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=55.96s)]
*  It's really having a brat summer. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=58.0s)]
*  Since May, views on Project 2025-related posts have increased more than tenfold, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=59.92s)]
*  spiking at 27.5 million daily views in July. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=65.56s)]
*  The 900-plus page document attracted negative attention over its ultra-right-leaning policies. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=69.52s)]
*  From its detailed plans for tougher restrictions on abortion, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=75.12s)]
*  to overhauling or eliminating some government agencies and firing thousands of civil servants. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=78.16s)]
*  Project 2025 has become a major target for Democrats in criticizing the MAGA movement and Donald Trump. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=83.6s)]
*  It's just given them a lot of details to push back against on abortion, on education, on civil rights. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=91.32s)]
*  Keynote speakers seized on the policy document at the Democratic National Convention, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=99.12s)]
*  tying it to Trump's plan for a second term in office. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about Project 2025. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump's roadmap to ban abortion in all 50 states. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=110.36s)]
*  I coached high school football long enough to know, and trust me on this, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=116.92s)]
*  when somebody takes the time to draw up a playbook, they're going to use it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=121.2s)]
*  We hear often about Kamala Harris as a new candidate and people not knowing what she would do and who she is. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=125.68s)]
*  And she needs to put forward more details about her policy agenda. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=133.23999999999998s)]
*  Project 2025 kind of shows what can happen when you do fill in all the details. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=137.16s)]
*  By being so comprehensive and so conservative across so many areas of government, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=143.48s)]
*  Project 2025 gave the Democrats an opportunity to say, hey, you have something at risk. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=148.48s)]
*  It's called Project 2025, a 922-page blueprint to make Donald Trump [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=155.32s)]
*  the most powerful president ever. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=161.88s)]
*  Less than 10 minutes into their first presidential debate, Harris zeroed in on the project again. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=164.44s)]
*  What you're going to hear tonight is a detailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025 [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=170.08s)]
*  that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected again. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=176.44s)]
*  Trump, meanwhile, has made numerous efforts to separate himself from the policy book. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=180.8s)]
*  I haven't read it. I don't want to read it purposely. I'm not going to read it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=185.36s)]
*  I don't know anything about it. I don't want to know anything about it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  He has disavowed it. He has said he has nothing to do with it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=192.0s)]
*  Not only is he saying that in his campaign, but we know in looking at his direct mail, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  mailings that go to people's mailboxes, that a lot of that mail is built around an effort to say [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  Project 2025 does not speak for Donald Trump. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=205.12s)]
*  That's true and not true at the same time. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=208.04s)]
*  Some of the policy people close to Donald Trump were very involved in creating Project 2025. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=210.56s)]
*  Kevin Roberts is the president of the Heritage Foundation and one of the driving forces [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=216.68s)]
*  behind the policy plan. In July, he spoke with The Wall Street Journal about the overlap [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=221.04s)]
*  between Trump's policies and Project 2025. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=225.64s)]
*  There are millions of Americans who are very supportive of what President Trump wants to do, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=228.64s)]
*  who in part are supportive because of what Project 2025 offers. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=234.72s)]
*  They're very excited about the possibility for those areas where President Trump and Project 2025 [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=238.88s)]
*  significantly overlap, the closing of the border, the revitalizing of the American economy, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=245.64s)]
*  the deregulation of the energy industry, and to almost quote President Trump verbatim, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=251.2s)]
*  to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=256.96s)]
*  As controversy around the document grew, Paul Dans, the director of the project, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=259.52s)]
*  left the Heritage Foundation in July. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=264.32s)]
*  Dans and Heritage disagree about the circumstances surrounding his departure. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=266.52s)]
*  Because of the controversy over it, the Heritage Foundation says that they've kind of wound [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=271.12s)]
*  down the policy work on this project. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=275.52s)]
*  The Heritage Foundation also launched a new website to counter what they say are the left's lies [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=278.35999999999996s)]
*  about Project 2025. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=284.08s)]
*  But the radical blueprint is still providing political fodder for liberals. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  In late September, House Democrats organized a hearing to discuss the consequences of some of [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=290.2s)]
*  Project 2025's proposals. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=295.35999999999996s)]
*  It would make overtime pay unlawful. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  And it would also mandate government surveillance of pregnancies and miscarriages. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=301.52s)]
*  But amid all this scrutiny, is Project 2025 and the rhetoric surrounding it affecting voters? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal polled on Project 2025 in August and asked, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=316.44s)]
*  do voters have a favorable or unfavorable view of it? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=320.68s)]
*  And we had two really remarkable findings in that poll. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  The first is people knew about it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=327.64s)]
*  More than two-thirds of people felt that they knew enough about Project 2025 to answer our question. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=330.6s)]
*  The second thing we found is that it is overwhelmingly unpopular. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=336.36s)]
*  In the poll, 57% of voters had a negative opinion of the agenda, including 53% who said [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=341.08s)]
*  their opinion was very negative. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=347.24s)]
*  Even Republicans have a negative view of Project 2025 if they're people who feel like they know [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=349.12s)]
*  enough about it to have an opinion one way or another. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=355.6s)]
*  And when it came to undecided or persuadable voters, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=358.24s)]
*  About half of up-for-grabs voters who could be the ones who decide this election had a [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=361.24s)]
*  negative view of Project 2025 and only 4% had a positive view. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=366.52s)]
*  So among the people who might decide this election, Project 2025 is a liability. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=371.68s)]
*  Pollsters say the forward-looking nature of the agenda, combined with its detailed policy [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=377.48s)]
*  breakdown, helped cement some voters' fears of what a second Trump term might look like. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=382.12s)]
*  People who are happy and complacent may or may not vote. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=387.68s)]
*  But people who are agitated and fearful, they tend to vote. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=391.36s)]
*  The idea that you have something and if you don't vote to protect it, you will lose it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=395.44s)]
*  Policy experts say Project 2025 also carried weight because it's a document voters can [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=400.68s)]
*  read themselves. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=406.03999999999996s)]
*  On page 465, Project 2025 calls for millions of people like yourself to pay more for prescription [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=407.4s)]
*  drugs like insulin. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=417.4s)]
*  It's there in black and white and it created a lot of targets for Democrats to aim at. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=419.12s)]
*  I can't believe they put that Project 2025 in writing. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=423.88s)]
*  They literally put it in writing. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=428.67999999999995s)]
*  They bound it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=431.28s)]
*  They handed it out. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=433.52s)]
*  But there are still voters that don't know about the playbook. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=435.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's providing an opening for both parties. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  In this election, both campaigns are trying to portray the other as outside of the mainstream [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=441.28s)]
*  and too extreme. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=447.40000000000003s)]
*  Republicans and Donald Trump are trying to say that Kamala Harris is a Marxist and that [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  her policies are socialist. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=454.16s)]
*  Project 2025 is part of the Democrats' effort to say that Donald Trump is outside of the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=456.24s)]
*  mainstream. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=461.96000000000004s)]
*  That both his policy agenda and his personal style are too extreme. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGbtSNUWG8&t=463.16s)]
