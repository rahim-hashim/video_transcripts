Video Description: Solar energy is the fastest growing clean energy source in the U.S., compared to wind, water and nuclear power. As extreme temperatures from heat waves strain electric grids in the U.S., many parts of the country could face blackouts. Solar energy is a potential solution to protect the grid during extreme heat.

WSJ explores how solar power could be effective during this extreme heat while looking at some of the challenges solar energy presents like increasing climate waste and efficiency issues.

# Heatwaves: Could Solar Energy Save the Electric Grid? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k)
*  More than 100 million people in the US are experiencing record high temperatures. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=0.0s)]
*  Heat waves are creating a higher demand for electricity and straining the already aging [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=6.04s)]
*  US electric grid, increasing the risk of blackouts. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=10.96s)]
*  Here's how renewable energy sources like solar could help maintain the grid and at [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=14.16s)]
*  what cost. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=19.68s)]
*  A customer-led revolution to solar and storage is the ultimate, fastest solution to climate [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=21.16s)]
*  change and to the grid demands of the future. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=28.96s)]
*  Mary Powell is the CEO of Sunrun, a company that provides residential solar services. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=32.6s)]
*  Solar on the customer's rooftop is interconnected with the grid. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=38.72s)]
*  So when the customer's home and using a lot of energy, it is by definition supporting [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=41.92s)]
*  the energy need that is going on right there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=48.2s)]
*  And when they're not, it is flowing right onto the grid as an energy resource to support [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=50.92s)]
*  the grid. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=57.0s)]
*  Solar panels paired with home batteries can be even more beneficial because the excess [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=58.54s)]
*  energy stored during the day can be sent back to the grid in the evening as solar production [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=62.96s)]
*  goes down. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=67.94s)]
*  And this energy storage can also be used to prevent the power grid from breaking down [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=68.94s)]
*  during extreme situations like a heat wave. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=74.08s)]
*  It is stunning to see this heat wave that is gripping the United States now. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=78.34s)]
*  It can really be the difference between the grid functioning or not during some of these [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=83.28s)]
*  significant climatic events that create incredible stress on the grid. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=89.42s)]
*  The U.S. Department of Energy said solar is the fastest growing clean energy source in [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=94.58s)]
*  the country compared to wind, water and nuclear power. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=99.9s)]
*  But despite its steady growth, solar power comes with limitations on how well it can [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=104.58s)]
*  and how much it can actually support the grid. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=109.94s)]
*  Over time, it will not produce as much as it did initially. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=113.66s)]
*  And so when we work with customers, what we always build around is an expected term of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=118.14s)]
*  25 years. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=122.86s)]
*  Residential solar panels degrade on a median rate of 0.5% a year. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=126.02s)]
*  A drop in efficiency means less solar energy traveling back to the grid to help out in [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=130.58s)]
*  times of need. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=135.74s)]
*  It also means customers will have to pay more for their utilities over time or pay a steep [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=137.5s)]
*  price to get the panels replaced. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=143.16s)]
*  Temperature can also affect the panels' efficiency. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=146.36s)]
*  Several solar panel providers state on their websites that output efficiency decreases [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=149.36s)]
*  with extreme temperatures. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=154.3s)]
*  And even though solar power is considered a type of green energy, what's really cool [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=156.96s)]
*  is yes, this energy source requires materials. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  It does not require fossil fuels. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=164.4s)]
*  Some materials used in the panels, such as lead and cadmium, can be toxic. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=166.68s)]
*  As demand increases, solar companies are engineering new technology to better adapt to extreme [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=172.68s)]
*  weather conditions. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=178.56s)]
*  Rooftop solar is just one of the many technologies experts say will be needed to help support [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=180.76000000000002s)]
*  the grid. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=185.78s)]
*  I knew we were never going to be able to scale in time to meet the demands of climate change [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=186.78s)]
*  without the kind of innovation and technological solutions that come with a more distributed [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKTn0c_i87k&t=191.88s)]
