# How Ecuador Became One of the World’s Most Violent Countries  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY)
*  Ecuador is at war with drug gangs. The South American country declared what it called an [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=0.0s)]
*  internal armed conflict after gunmen took over a TV studio and launched a series of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=6.32s)]
*  attacks. Fighting intensified after a top gang leader escaped from prison on Sunday, prompting [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=12.08s)]
*  a 60-day state of emergency. Here's what's caused Ecuador's wave of violence and what's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=20.04s)]
*  at stake for the region and the US as gangs fight for control of lucrative cocaine trafficking [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=26.28s)]
*  routes. Ecuador has been going through a surge of violence over the last three or four years. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=32.2s)]
*  It's gone from one of the safest countries in Latin America to one of the most violent, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=37.72s)]
*  and that's due to the drug trade. On Sunday what happened is that a lot of the drug gangs, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=40.72s)]
*  their leaders are located in the prisons, and one of the leaders of one of the biggest [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=45.6s)]
*  gangs in Ecuador escaped from prison on Sunday. That prompted a response from the new president, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=49.72s)]
*  Daniel Navoa, who issued a state of emergency and sent in law enforcement to try to take control [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=55.68s)]
*  of the prisons. A day after that happened on Tuesday, another gang members took over a TV [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=60.96s)]
*  station in Guayaquil, the country's biggest city. Then across the country, really, there was [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=67.84s)]
*  different incidents that occurred. Car bombs, police were kidnapped. It seemed like a very [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=72.2s)]
*  coordinated response to the government to try to send a message. President Daniel Navoa, who's [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  only been in office since November, he declared an internal armed conflict in Ecuador. So what that [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=83.24s)]
*  practically means is that the military will now have a greater role in trying to improve security. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=88.36s)]
*  So basically the gangs become military targets. The soldiers are able to try to neutralize them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=94.36s)]
*  The root of this wave of violence is an increasing drug trade. Drugs flowing in from Colombia, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  mainly that are going up to Europe and the United States, they are now moving into Ecuador. A lot [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=105.56s)]
*  of the cocaine production in Colombia is on the border with Ecuador. The security experts say that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=110.36s)]
*  it's actually easier for Colombian gangs to move the drugs into Ecuador rather than straight out [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=115.72s)]
*  of Colombia. Ecuador has really good roads, has really good infrastructure, has little security at [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=120.52s)]
*  the ports. Ecuador also is a dollarized economy, so that makes it easier for drug gangs to wander [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=125.8s)]
*  their money into the country. And that has attracted a lot of attention from international [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=133.24s)]
*  cartels, Mexican cartels, Albanian cartels, for example, and it has provided a lot more resources [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=138.04000000000002s)]
*  for the local gangs who are now controlling this. At the same time, a really key factor in this [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=143.56s)]
*  violence has been the government's inability to control what happens inside the prisons. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=148.36s)]
*  The prisons have become the headquarters and the de facto headquarters for the gangs, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=154.12s)]
*  where they operate with immunity from inside. Security experts will say that what needs to be [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  done, the first thing needs to be done, is that the government needs to take back control of the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=165.32s)]
*  prisons. Without that, it's very difficult to weaken the gangs and to reduce the violence. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=168.44s)]
*  Longer term, it's an issue of how to deal with the international drug trade. And then, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=176.44s)]
*  in the U.S., Europe, Colombia, Mexico, several landmine countries right now are struggling [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=182.2s)]
*  with increased crime. Ecuador is, I think, the most startling example of that by far. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEuL0aP2amY&t=188.51999999999998s)]
