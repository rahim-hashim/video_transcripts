# How Private Companies Are Bypassing the IPO Process | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 30, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI)
*  There's a big trend right now in the IPO world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=0.0s)]
*  The latest company to go public through a SPAC IPO. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  SPACs for many, many years had a very bad name. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=7.76s)]
*  Over the last two years, companies like Nikola, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=10.92s)]
*  DraftKings, and Virgin Galactic have all entered the market [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=13.68s)]
*  through something called SPACs, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=16.94s)]
*  or Special Purpose Acquisition Companies. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=18.76s)]
*  These controversial entities, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  also known as blank check companies, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=22.7s)]
*  offer private businesses a fast track to going public [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=24.88s)]
*  that bypasses the traditional IPO process. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=28.16s)]
*  And they're growing more popular. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=31.32s)]
*  You can see activity has almost quadrupled so far in 2020. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=33.14s)]
*  Some investors see a big opportunity in SPACs [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=37.1s)]
*  and say they're a more efficient way [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=40.0s)]
*  for companies to go public. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=41.84s)]
*  But critics say they allow for backdoor deals [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=43.34s)]
*  and that they're not worth the risk. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=46.0s)]
*  One criticism of the SPAC process [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=47.84s)]
*  is that investors can get into a company [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=49.56s)]
*  and then get burned. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=51.900000000000006s)]
*  They won't have the time to figure out [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=52.96s)]
*  if it's really a legitimate company [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  and there is even a risk of fraud. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=56.2s)]
*  To understand why investors are rushing [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=57.6s)]
*  to blank check companies despite the potential risks, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  first you need to understand how they work. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=62.92s)]
*  SPACs are public shell companies [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=68.86s)]
*  that exist for a single purpose, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=71.0s)]
*  finding a private company and taking it to market quickly. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=73.08s)]
*  In order to take a company public, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  a SPAC will merge with it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=78.26s)]
*  The company then gets a spot on the exchange [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=79.84s)]
*  and a new ticker. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=82.4s)]
*  The SPAC transforms into the target company, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=83.88s)]
*  taking on its name. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=86.86s)]
*  Once the deal closes, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=88.22s)]
*  investors who own shares in the blank check company [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=89.6s)]
*  now own a piece of the new entity [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=92.46s)]
*  and the founders of the SPAC get a large part of it too, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=94.38s)]
*  often at a very good price. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=97.58s)]
*  Blank check companies are primarily owned [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=99.86s)]
*  by veteran corporate leaders and big investors, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=102.1s)]
*  like private equity firms. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=105.06s)]
*  Usually it's a smaller amount of shares [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=106.62s)]
*  that are available to the public. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=108.62s)]
*  Ideally, a SPAC gives you an opportunity [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=110.34s)]
*  to invest in a good management team [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=112.98s)]
*  or in a good entrepreneur, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=115.8s)]
*  where you have a good feeling about them [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=117.38s)]
*  doing some sort of profitable deal [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=119.28s)]
*  that increases the value of the investment. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=121.78s)]
*  But it is writing a blank check, you're taking a risk. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=124.64s)]
*  You don't know if they're gonna do a good deal [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  and have the stock go up, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=128.96s)]
*  or if they're gonna do a bad deal [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  and the stock will go down. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  For the companies going public, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=132.5s)]
*  SPACs offer a different approach than traditional IPOs, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  where the private company works with underwriters [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=137.6s)]
*  or investment banks to work out a deal [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=139.88s)]
*  and then takes the company public. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=142.24s)]
*  The process can take months, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=144.22s)]
*  and under traditional IPO rules, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=145.78s)]
*  the private company must stay quiet [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=148.0s)]
*  and refrain from promoting its shares [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=149.66s)]
*  until they start trading. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=151.58s)]
*  This is where SPACs have a big advantage. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=153.18s)]
*  With a SPAC deal, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=156.02s)]
*  companies can actually talk about themselves [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=157.5s)]
*  and promote themselves to investors [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=159.5s)]
*  in a way that they can't with an IPO. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=161.5s)]
*  Analysts say growing mainstream acceptance of SPACs [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=164.06s)]
*  helped fuel this year's boom, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=167.34s)]
*  but it was also the coronavirus pandemic. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=169.14s)]
*  We are looking at another day of extreme volatility. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=171.66s)]
*  Stocks opened just moments ago [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=175.06s)]
*  with the Dow down more than 600 points. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=177.14s)]
*  This is because during volatile markets, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=179.98s)]
*  a company's valuation can crash overnight. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=182.54s)]
*  The main advantage to going public through a SPAC, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=185.3s)]
*  it's been definitely true this year, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=187.62s)]
*  is there's more certainty of execution. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=189.42s)]
*  You know earlier on in the process [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=191.42s)]
*  that you'll get the deal done. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=193.14s)]
*  IPOs get derailed at the last minute all the time [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=194.57999999999998s)]
*  because the markets are volatile, they're falling, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=197.78s)]
*  nobody wants to go public. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=200.52s)]
*  And this year, many of the companies [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=201.88000000000002s)]
*  going public through SPACs are seeing big valuations. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  In September, United Wholesale Mortgage [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  agreed to go public in the biggest SPAC deal ever [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=209.8s)]
*  with a $16 billion valuation. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=213.08s)]
*  This is a sharp change from the early days in the 1980s [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=215.84s)]
*  when the precursors of today's SPACs [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=219.44s)]
*  were called blind pools. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  These had a shady reputation tied to penny stock frauds. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=223.32000000000002s)]
*  But in the decades since, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=227.12s)]
*  new laws and regulations helped add credibility [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=228.88s)]
*  and bolster investor confidence. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=232.04s)]
*  Now, as SPACs gain momentum, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=234.52s)]
*  more blue chip institutions and veteran investors [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=237.04s)]
*  are buying in. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=240.4s)]
*  For instance, Goldman Sachs never used [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=241.56s)]
*  to underwrite SPAC IPOs. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=243.24s)]
*  A few years ago, it did its first SPAC IPO. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=245.28s)]
*  The New York Stock Exchange now lists a lot of SPACs. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=249.56s)]
*  For a long time, it did not. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=252.44s)]
*  And with SPAC funds getting larger, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=254.12s)]
*  the size of blank check deals are expected to grow as well. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=256.14s)]
*  This year, Bill Ackman launched the biggest SPAC ever. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=259.82s)]
*  It could potentially take a very, very large company public. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=263.06s)]
*  Our thesis here is by having a $5 billion cash pile [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=266.86s)]
*  in a public company, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=270.97999999999996s)]
*  it's really, it's our own version of a unicorn. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=272.38s)]
*  Still, some critics remain concerned [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  that companies going public through SPACs [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=276.94s)]
*  aren't getting as much scrutiny [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=279.5s)]
*  as those using traditional IPOs. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=281.09999999999997s)]
*  Exhibit A for that might be the situation [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=283.94s)]
*  with Nikola, which went public through a SPAC [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=285.98s)]
*  a few months ago and has turned out to be the center [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=288.42s)]
*  of a firestorm of fraud allegations. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=293.06s)]
*  Nikola shares are tumbling after a short seller [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=295.46000000000004s)]
*  called the company, quote, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=298.14000000000004s)]
*  an intricate fraud built on dozens of lies. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=299.14000000000004s)]
*  The people who don't like SPACs [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=302.62s)]
*  and prefer traditional IPOs would tell you [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=304.62s)]
*  that if it had gone through a traditional IPO, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=307.26s)]
*  there would have been more time for investors [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=309.62s)]
*  to kick the tires and to scrutinize the company [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=311.1s)]
*  for fraud before it went public. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=314.34000000000003s)]
*  Federal regulators are raising concerns as well. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=316.62s)]
*  The SEC is now examining how blank check companies [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=320.02000000000004s)]
*  disclose their ownership [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=323.46000000000004s)]
*  and how compensation is tied to an acquisition. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=325.1s)]
*  We wanna make sure that investors understand those things. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=327.66s)]
*  And then at the time of the transaction, when they vote, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=331.54s)]
*  that they're getting the same rigorous disclosure [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=335.54s)]
*  that you get in connection with bringing an IPO to market. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=340.02s)]
*  Critics also say SPACs have often been a bad deal [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyT7KfnFrI&t=342.94s)]
