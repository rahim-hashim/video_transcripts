# Trump vs. Harris Highlights Fiery Debate Puts Former President on Defense  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0)
*  So let's now welcome the candidates to the stage. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=0.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=2.4s)]
*  Let's have a good debate. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=3.6s)]
*  Donald Trump has been in numerous presidential debates, but this is the first presidential [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  debate that Kamala Harris has been in. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=9.38s)]
*  And I think millions of Americans were watching to see how she would perform without a teleprompter, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=11.76s)]
*  without notes, without aides by her side. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=15.88s)]
*  Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  So let's be clear about that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=21.8s)]
*  And clearly he is having a very difficult time processing that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=23.5s)]
*  Early on in the debate, Vice President Harris set a trap for Donald Trump when she brought [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=27.2s)]
*  up out of thin air this idea that people were leaving his rallies early because they were [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=31.8s)]
*  so bored with the things he was saying. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=35.82s)]
*  You will see during the course of his rallies he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=38.32s)]
*  Lecter. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=42.68s)]
*  He will talk about windmills cause cancer. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=43.84s)]
*  And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  and boredom. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=52.0s)]
*  This wasn't in response to a question. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=53.0s)]
*  It was just something that she kind of planted there because she knows that Donald Trump [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=54.46s)]
*  cannot take any allegation about his crowd sizes and move on. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=58.02s)]
*  People don't leave my rallies. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=61.94s)]
*  We have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=63.1s)]
*  He was a little bit more all over the place and it prevented him from attacking her on [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=66.78s)]
*  a range of issues where he might have had the upper hand from, you know, immigration [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=71.86s)]
*  to the economy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=75.98s)]
*  Donald Trump probably had his most effective attack lines of the night when he was talking [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=76.98s)]
*  the positions that Harris has changed over the course of her political career. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=82.22s)]
*  Fracking? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=85.86s)]
*  She's been against it for 12 years. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=86.86s)]
*  Defund the police? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=89.42s)]
*  She's been against that forever. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=90.7s)]
*  She gave all that stuff up very wrongly, very horribly, and everybody's laughing at it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=92.62s)]
*  The fracking issue is a huge one in Pennsylvania where this debate was held because big parts [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=98.86000000000001s)]
*  of Western Pennsylvania, this accounts for a lot of jobs. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=102.86000000000001s)]
*  And so he was pretty effective in going right at her and saying that these are positions [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=105.98s)]
*  she's changed in the past and how do we know that she's not going to change her position [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=110.26s)]
*  again. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=113.94000000000001s)]
*  During the course of the debate, conservatives were screaming that the moderators from ABC [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=114.94s)]
*  were unfair to former President Trump. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=120.02000000000001s)]
*  On a number of occasions, but not too many occasions, but quite notably several, the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=123.02000000000001s)]
*  moderators corrected him, fact-checked him in real time. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  They're eating the dogs, the people that came in. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=131.42000000000002s)]
*  They're eating the cats. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=134.18s)]
*  They're eating the pets of the people that live there. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=135.74s)]
*  And this is what's happening in our country. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=141.54000000000002s)]
*  I just want to clarify here, you bring up Springfield, Ohio, and ABC News did reach [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=143.82000000000002s)]
*  out to the city manager there. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=148.22s)]
*  He told us there had been no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed, injured, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=149.74s)]
*  or abused by individuals within the immigrant community. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=154.62s)]
*  These were statements that Trump has made repeatedly that have been fact-checked many [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=157.74s)]
*  times as not being true. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=163.17999999999998s)]
*  So they didn't kind of wade into something that was maybe more, you know, a gray area. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=164.82s)]
*  But still, it was notable how it happened and many conservatives, even some lawmakers, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=170.14s)]
*  were alarmed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=176.42s)]
*  One other key point in the night was when both candidates were asked about what they [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=177.42s)]
*  would do to resolve the conflict in the Middle East. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=181.06s)]
*  We must have a two-state solution where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=183.73999999999998s)]
*  Security, self-determination, and the dignity they so rightly deserve. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=189.82s)]
*  I will get that settled and fast, and I'll get the war with Ukraine and Russia ended. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=194.22s)]
*  If I'm president-elect, I'll get it done before even becoming president. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=200.26s)]
*  This is not an easy issue, obviously, but neither of them would lay forth a plan about [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=205.26s)]
*  what they would do to have this behind them. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=209.85999999999999s)]
*  Harris talked about how she wanted to help families. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=211.98s)]
*  She kept talking about this opportunity economy, which is, you know, kind of a buzz phrase [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=214.74s)]
*  that Democrats are using. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  But there weren't a lot of specific new policies. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=221.58s)]
*  There was one point when former President Trump was pressed on his approach to replacing [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=223.74s)]
*  the Affordable Care Act. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  I'm not president right now. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=230.58s)]
*  But if we come up with something, I would only change it if we come up with something [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=232.62s)]
*  that's better and less expensive. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=237.78s)]
*  And there are concepts and options we have to do that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  And you'll be hearing about it in the not-too-distant future. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=244.38000000000002s)]
*  Former President Trump brought forward a lot of the ideas that he's had in the past. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=247.26000000000002s)]
*  He wants to raise tariffs. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=251.42000000000002s)]
*  He wants to shut down the border between the U.S. and Mexico. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=252.86s)]
*  They are popular ideas with his base. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=256.26s)]
*  And the fact that he's going to stick to these ideas and continue to push for them and drive [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=258.7s)]
*  them home, that is the kind of consistent message that a lot of Republicans and conservatives [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=262.38s)]
*  and independents want to hear. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=266.54s)]
*  The debate at the end of June between Biden and Trump was a disaster for Biden and knocked [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=267.90000000000003s)]
*  him out of the race. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=272.82s)]
*  Harris could not afford to have a bad debate. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=274.06s)]
*  So many Americans do not know her, do not really understand what her policies are. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=276.65999999999997s)]
*  And if she kind of fumbled her way through the evening, it could have been the end of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=281.38s)]
*  her candidacy as well. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=285.06s)]
*  So we learned that she can hold her own, that she can go toe-to-toe with former President [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=286.82s)]
*  Trump for 90 minutes, whether she did enough to win over independent voters, whether she [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=290.85999999999996s)]
*  did enough to kind of assure people in places like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=295.58s)]
*  Arizona, that she's the one that'll take the country where it needs to go in the future. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=302.46s)]
*  It's unclear. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc729RZ4XM0&t=307.82s)]
