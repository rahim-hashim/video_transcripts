# AMC: From Silver Screen Giant to Box-Office Flop | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 01, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg)
*  For theater chains, 2020 started out with a bang. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=0.0s)]
*  The opening weekend for Bad Boys for Life, starring Will Smith, raked in more than $73 million. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=3.84s)]
*  Many of those tickets were sold at AMC theaters. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=13.44s)]
*  The year before, the world's largest theater chain took in nearly $5.5 billion [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=16.32s)]
*  and was poised for another strong showing in 2020. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=21.44s)]
*  But the coronavirus pandemic quickly made going to the movies a public health risk. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  And in mid-March, AMC closed all of its roughly 630 US locations. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=28.32s)]
*  But the coronavirus pandemic isn't the only thing pushing the company onto financially shaky ground. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=33.44s)]
*  Here's how AMC went from king of the silver screen to trying to avoid bankruptcy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  The first movie theaters opened around the turn of the 20th century. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=44.96s)]
*  And by 1916, there were more than 21,000 movie theaters in the US. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=48.56s)]
*  Most were Nickelodeons, named after the admission price of one nickel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=54.16s)]
*  In 1920, the Dubinsky family purchased a theater in Kansas City, Missouri. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=58.4s)]
*  Their company would later be renamed American Multicinema, or AMC. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=63.04s)]
*  AMC introduced the world's first multiplex in the early 60s. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=68.0s)]
*  And 10 years later, the company owned 183 theaters in 13 states. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=72.48s)]
*  Soon after, AMC was molding the movie-going experience into what it is today. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=79.84s)]
*  Attendance rose in movie theaters in the US, as Hollywood sort of improved its ability to build [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  these blockbusters that were rich in spectacle, special effects. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=91.28s)]
*  AMC played a big role as it was building prominent multiplexes in the 1980s. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  AMC was also the first theater to install cup holders and the armrests. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=102.63999999999999s)]
*  And they also promoted the ramped-up stadium seating that's sort of ubiquitous today. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=106.56s)]
*  But then throughout time, you had other introductions of technological advancements [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=111.44s)]
*  like the VCR, and you had cable television like HBO. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=115.52s)]
*  Because of these new at-home options, Sumner Redstone, who owned rival theater [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=118.88s)]
*  chain National Amusements, said he planned to put a halt on building new theaters. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=122.56s)]
*  Not AMC. By the end of the decade, it had more than 290 locations. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=127.44s)]
*  But still only around 1,700 of the US's 23,000 total movie screens. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=132.4s)]
*  In the 90s, the company rushed to build megaplexes with 16 or more auditoriums, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=138.08s)]
*  faster than any other chain. By the end of the decade, it had 2,700 screens, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  about half of them in megaplexes. But that building boom put the entire theater [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=148.56s)]
*  industry into debt to the tune of more than $5 billion. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  Two years later, AMC strengthened its balance sheet by selling a quarter billion dollars of stock [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  to the private equity firm Apollo Management, which effectively took control of the company. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  The new investors got in just as the industry was hitting its peak of nearly 1.6 billion theater [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=168.08s)]
*  admissions a year. This marked the beginning of an era of rapid acquisition for the movie chain. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=174.0s)]
*  In 2005, AMC merged with rival Lowe's Theaters. The roughly $4 billion deal created a 5,900-screen [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=179.52s)]
*  theater empire. Then, seven years later, China's richest man at the time, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=187.44s)]
*  Wang Jianlin, put AMC on course to become the biggest movie theater chain in the world. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=191.76s)]
*  He bought the company for around $2.6 billion. That included nearly $2 billion in debt. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=197.68s)]
*  But movie studios were beginning to make bigger demands for theaters to screen blockbuster films. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  In 2013, before the release of Iron Man 3, AMC and rival Regal Theaters refused to sell online [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=210.16s)]
*  tickets to Disney's highly anticipated movie. Typically, studios and movie theaters will split [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=216.88s)]
*  ticket revenue 50-50. Studios make the movie, they market the movie, theaters show the movie. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=222.32s)]
*  AMC and Regal said Disney wanted too much of a cut. The three companies eventually reached a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=228.72s)]
*  compromise, but the standoff showed a shift in the power dynamics around hit movies. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=234.32s)]
*  This model of creating big event-style movies and fewer movies has become the model [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=239.76s)]
*  that is most successful. So you're seeing these huge big blockbusters like an Avengers movie. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  And as more emphasis has been put on fewer movies, that in turn has given studios more leverage. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  Despite fewer movies driving ticket sales, the theater giant kept on growing. In 2016, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=260.48s)]
*  AMC acquired both US-based Carmike Cinemas and Europe's Odeon and UCI Cinemas Group, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=266.32s)]
*  making it the world's largest movie theater company. But by then, movie attendance numbers [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=272.4s)]
*  had flattened, exposing a major liability for the industry. Too many theaters and not enough [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  people to fill them. You had old theaters, so you needed newer theaters that were nicer to compete [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=283.76s)]
*  against those older theaters, but at the same time you had all these better options at home, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=290.0s)]
*  the bigger TVs, streaming and DVD and whatnot. To keep pace, theater chains raised ticket prices, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  but also upgraded their amenities to draw viewers out of the home. They're trying to make the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=300.72s)]
*  experience more luxurious with lazy boy chairs, offering better food options, anything they can [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  to sort of offset and convince people, hey, it's worth paying this extra one or two dollars a ticket. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=311.04s)]
*  This business model worked as long as there were hit movies to sell tickets. In 2017, revenues [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=316.0s)]
*  climbed with the help of such hits as Finding Dory and Rogue One, a Star Wars story. But the next year, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=322.88000000000005s)]
*  lackluster box office performance led to declining revenues and AMC's share price plummeted. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=329.36s)]
*  Add to that another shot across the bow from Disney. It required theaters to commit to giving [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=335.6s)]
*  the studio a record high 65% of ticket revenues to screen Star Wars The Last Jedi. These big [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  movies like a Star Wars Avengers, these movies are make or break for theaters. They need those [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=349.6s)]
*  movies in order to have a good year. In 2019, AMC screened Marvel's Avengers End Game, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=354.8s)]
*  a record 58,000 times over its opening weekend. Then in 2020, disaster struck the entire industry [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=362.16s)]
*  with the coronavirus pandemic. In March, AMC announced it was closing all of its theaters [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  worldwide. It happened at a time when the company was loaded with nearly $5 billion in debt, causing [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=374.8s)]
*  the CEO to sound the alarm. There are no revenues coming in the door. We're going to have to get [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=381.2s)]
*  liquidity from someplace if we have all in our industry, if we all have expenses and none of us [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=386.88s)]
*  have revenues. A lot of people believe that the market was oversupplied, that there's too many [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  screens, too many theaters in the U.S. And I've spoken to a lot of people and they predict as many [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  as half of theaters in the U.S. and Canada could go out of business forever after the end of the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  pandemic. AMC is thrilled to welcome you back to the movies with our new AMC Safe and Clean [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=407.28s)]
*  Initiative. For now, AMC has buoyed itself by reopening over 80% of its locations, although with [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=414.08s)]
*  social distancing guidelines and without many marquee movies. And its stock price spiked following [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=420.88s)]
*  the announcement of an effective coronavirus vaccine candidate. But it was still far removed from [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  its highs five years ago. Right now, the company is burning through $100 million a month and faces [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=432.56s)]
*  the possibility of running out of cash by year's end. Studios fear that people will just become [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=440.16s)]
*  increasingly more accustomed to watching movies at home. And when the pandemic's over, instead of it [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=447.2s)]
*  bouncing back to normal, maybe even the frequent moviegoers instead of going six or seven times a [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=452.88s)]
*  year, if they're only going two or three times a year. The CEO recently told investors the company [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=458.08s)]
*  was prioritizing raising cash and reducing costs. But at least for now, there doesn't seem to be much [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=463.59999999999997s)]
*  of a silver lining for the silver screen giant. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cRHGNPRKvg&t=469.84s)]
