# The Cost of Becoming an Olympic Swimmer for Team USA  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg)
*  Olympians train for almost their entire lives with the goal of winding up here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=0.0s)]
*  And that goal comes at a heavy price. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=4.8s)]
*  It costs a lot. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=8.2s)]
*  It really honestly does between the training and the traveling coaches fees quite a bit. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=9.8s)]
*  It might pay off and they can wind up here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=17.6s)]
*  Because a complete breakfast with Wheaties is good tasting and good for you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=20.2s)]
*  But to get there requires years of financial investment. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=25.2s)]
*  You're going to be in a club program that's going to cost about $5,000 a year. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  There's also fees to be paid for going to competitions. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=32.8s)]
*  If you go away to an away meet, you're going to travel. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=36.199999999999996s)]
*  You may fly, you may drive, you're going to have to stay at a hotel. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=39.0s)]
*  All those expenses add up. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=42.4s)]
*  Even relatively accessible sports like swimming can cost athletes thousands every year. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=44.4s)]
*  Those expenses start as a child and only get more expensive over time. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=49.2s)]
*  Costing Olympians and their families hundreds of thousands of dollars in hopes of making it to the Olympic Games. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=52.8s)]
*  Here's a look at how much it costs to become an Olympic swimmer. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=59.4s)]
*  Unlike other sports, there aren't a bunch of things you need to buy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=62.8s)]
*  The cost of equipment is subjected to preference. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  But competitive swimmers use special swimsuits called tech suits, which can add up. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=69.0s)]
*  Men's tech suits like this one can cost up to $400 and women's can cost up to $600. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=74.2s)]
*  They could last one meet, you know, three or four swims. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=80.8s)]
*  It all depends on how long you want to wear them, if they rip or tear or wear out. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  You know, the suit fits very tightly. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  If you buy two, three or four suits a year, you know, you're spending $2,000 on bathing suits. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=93.6s)]
*  Swim caps and goggles are not as expensive and can cost up to $300 per year. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  And there's one more piece of important equipment, a pool. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  Swimming schools like Swim Labs, a USA swimming officially recognized professional swim lesson provider, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=106.2s)]
*  has locations all across the US. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=111.4s)]
*  Their location in Westchester, New York offers private lessons that cost $349 per month. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=113.4s)]
*  Regardless of where young swimmers learn how to swim, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=119.4s)]
*  competitive swimmers will need access to Olympic-sized pools for real training in the sport. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=122.2s)]
*  This usually means joining a club's competitive swimming team. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=127.2s)]
*  Welcome to Meadowbrook. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=130.4s)]
*  It's the swim facility where Phelps and fellow Olympic medalist, Katie Hoff, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=131.8s)]
*  both got their start. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=135.8s)]
*  USA Swimming's number one ranked swim club in the United States is NCAP, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=137.60000000000002s)]
*  or the nation's capital swim club. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  In 2021, a club membership in the Gold 1 category for elite swimmers at their Washington, DC location [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=143.0s)]
*  will set a swimmer back about $5,860 per year. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=149.4s)]
*  Swimmers start swimming for their local clubs at around eight years old, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=153.8s)]
*  but usually will start no later than 12. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=156.8s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of club programs in the country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  In the metropolitan area, there's well over a hundred different programs. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=161.4s)]
*  And across the country, you're talking about thousands of clubs. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=164.6s)]
*  Without club swimming, we wouldn't have an Olympic team. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  They continue to compete for clubs until they reach the collegiate level, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=170.6s)]
*  where many of them begin swimming for Division I universities. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=174.0s)]
*  And some continue both. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=177.0s)]
*  So by the time kids reach the college level, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  they've already spent $16,000 to $40,000 on club dues alone. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=181.0s)]
*  In 2019, USA Swimming had 412,000 members and over 3,000 clubs who paid more than $22 million in fees. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=185.6s)]
*  They're the governing body of the sport, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=194.0s)]
*  responsible for organizing events and recording official times for national rankings. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=195.8s)]
*  Registered members pay an annual fee of $60. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=200.6s)]
*  That fee allows swimmers to compete in sanctioned competitions. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=203.8s)]
*  And one of those sanctioned competitions are the Olympic trials. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=207.4s)]
*  According to CoachCon, some elite swimmers might seek private coaching to be more competitive. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=211.2s)]
*  And depending on the coach, private coaching can run a student more than $1,000 per month. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=215.8s)]
*  Total expenses can vary widely from person to person. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=220.6s)]
*  USA Swimming estimates expenses for Olympic cold pools can be anywhere from $25,000 to $40,000 [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=223.8s)]
*  for proper coaching, equipment, training, and travel each year. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  And depending on the swimmer's training program, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  they may also need a budget for other costs, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=235.4s)]
*  like a nutritionist, physical therapist, or a gym membership. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=237.4s)]
*  The cost of competing in any non-NCAA competitions that collegiate swimmers enter will come out of their own pocket. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=240.8s)]
*  Swimmers who choose the collegiate route get access to all the necessary amenities and facilities they need, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  as well as physical therapists, trainers, coaches, and doctors. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=251.4s)]
*  Olympians like Michael Andrew chose to skip the collegiate route to focus all their efforts on Olympic training. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=255.4s)]
*  However, that means the cost of their coaching, training, travel, entrance fees, and lodging is all on them. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=261.0s)]
*  It is much harder to be an individual athlete training by yourself in reaching those top levels. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=268.0s)]
*  Since 1978, the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee has not been funded by the US government, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=278.0s)]
*  so US Olympians rely on grants and sponsorships to offset the out-of-pocket costs for their training. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=283.6s)]
*  USA Swimming gives yearly stipends to top swimmers on the national team. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=289.2s)]
*  They also provide bonuses for swimmers who make it onto the Olympic team. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=293.2s)]
*  USA Swimming spends an average of $10 million per year in support of national team athletes, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=296.6s)]
*  and according to them, most Olympic and Paralympic cold pools make less than $20,000 a year. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=302.2s)]
*  Coach Kahn says there are sponsored clubs who can afford to pay their swimmers to be a part of their team. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=308.8s)]
*  Because you need to have money to live, you need money to train, and you don't have that money, who's going to help you do it? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=313.2s)]
*  The cost of being an elite Olympic swimmer is a full-time investment of training both in and out of the pool. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  As in most professional sports, the best athletes earn the biggest paychecks, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  and in swimming, those paychecks come almost exclusively in the form of large individual endorsement deals and sponsorships. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAFc_CA2YQg&t=330.0s)]
