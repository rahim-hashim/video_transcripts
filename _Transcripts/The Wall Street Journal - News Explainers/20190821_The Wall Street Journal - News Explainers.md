# Why You’re Probably Paying For Faster Internet Speeds Than You Use  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 21, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA)
*  We've all been here. You want to stream a show, but when you go to load it, it does this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=0.0s)]
*  In the age of high-speed internet, the circle can be maddening. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=7.0s)]
*  But before you call your provider, know that you're probably already paying for faster internet speeds than you actually use. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=11.0s)]
*  We'll explain. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=19.0s)]
*  This is your computer. It connects to your router. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=21.0s)]
*  Your router is one of many routers which make up your provider's network. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=26.0s)]
*  Your provider's network is one of more than 70,000 such networks that make up the internet. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=30.0s)]
*  When you try to load a video or type really anything into your browser, your router sends the request on a journey across the internet. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=36.0s)]
*  Often, it's the journey back where things can get a little complicated and crowded. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=44.0s)]
*  Imagine a network of highways with delivery trucks running across it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=49.0s)]
*  Each of these are packets, the basic unit of internet traffic. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=53.0s)]
*  Some are Amazon, some are Netflix, and some might be a photo you're emailing to your aunt. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=57.0s)]
*  And they're all taking different routes based on agreements the networks have with each other. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=62.0s)]
*  Your video might be passed from one network to another until it gets back to you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=67.0s)]
*  Or the content provider might pay a transit provider to carry the request back. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=72.0s)]
*  Either way, it's sharing the roads with a lot of other content, so there are plenty of places where things can get jammed up. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=78.0s)]
*  Any time one network hands off content to another, there's potential for a traffic jam, which can slow down your video and cause a spinning wheel. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=85.0s)]
*  The important thing to understand is that you can't fix a bottleneck out here by paying your provider for higher speeds within your own network. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=94.0s)]
*  Your network is only responsible for this leg of the journey. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=103.0s)]
*  Paying for faster internet just because you encountered a spinning wheel is kind of like getting a bigger driveway in hopes you'll get to work faster. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=107.0s)]
*  So what does all of this look like in real life? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=115.0s)]
*  In real life, these networks are made of millions of miles of fiber and cable running around the world and connecting with each other in big data centers full of servers. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=118.0s)]
*  Here's an actual request for the home page of a local broadcaster in New Zealand, provided to us by researchers at the University of Chicago. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=129.0s)]
*  It starts in Vienna, Virginia, outside of Washington, D.C. with a Verizon Fios user, and travels across the country on Verizon's network. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=137.0s)]
*  In California, it connects to a different network, which sends it to Austin, Texas, and then back to California. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=146.0s)]
*  It then gets handed to a transit provider, which sends it across the Pacific Ocean to Auckland, New Zealand. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=154.0s)]
*  It likely takes a similar path back. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=160.0s)]
*  See all the opportunities for traffic jams? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=163.0s)]
*  Other trips have few or even no handoffs. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=166.0s)]
*  Powerful tech companies like Google, Netflix, and Amazon, and content delivery networks have rolled out thousands of servers spanning the globe to get copies of popular content closer to you. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=169.0s)]
*  Smaller sites can rent space from some of these companies to speed up their journey. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=180.0s)]
*  Here's a request for Netflix.com that starts in Los Angeles, California. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=184.0s)]
*  It goes to a server in Calipatria, California. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=189.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=192.0s)]
*  So why do you sometimes get a spinning wheel when you request content from Netflix or other big tech companies? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=194.0s)]
*  Well, sometimes their servers can crash and cause an outage, or maybe they took a longer route that got congested. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=200.0s)]
*  But the problem could be closer to home. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=206.0s)]
*  Are you trying to stream video during peak evening hours? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=209.0s)]
*  In many networks, you're sharing bandwidth with your neighbors. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=212.0s)]
*  Or maybe it's your Wi-Fi. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=216.0s)]
*  Maybe you're leasing an out-of-date modem or router from your provider that isn't capable of receiving the speeds you're paying for. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=218.0s)]
*  It might be worth an upgrade. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=224.0s)]
*  You may also have an interference problem from another device, like your neighbor's baby monitor. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=226.0s)]
*  Or maybe you're just too far away from your router. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=231.0s)]
*  Or it just could be your own device. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=234.0s)]
*  Are you using an old laptop or phone? Or an outdated streaming box? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=237.0s)]
*  Your device could be slowing you down. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=241.0s)]
*  It could help to restart your modem or router or even invest in a better one. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=244.0s)]
*  Same for your devices. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=248.0s)]
*  But a lot is still out of your control. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=250.0s)]
*  Like if your neighbor's son is downloading 15 video games one night. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=252.0s)]
*  Or a traffic jam out in the internet. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=255.0s)]
*  So next time this happens and you call your provider, they'll likely try to sell you more speed for your connection. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=258.0s)]
*  But now you know better. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAoQuF2DFA&t=264.0s)]
