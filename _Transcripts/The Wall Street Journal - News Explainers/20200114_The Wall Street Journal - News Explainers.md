# Why Big Tech Is Getting Into Finance  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 14, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4)
*  Big tech has its eyes set on your wallet. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=0.0s)]
*  Apple has a credit card. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=3.96s)]
*  Facebook is trying to introduce its own currency. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=5.84s)]
*  And Google has plans to offer checking accounts [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=8.8s)]
*  to users of its digital wallet in 2020. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=11.16s)]
*  You can do a lot with a wallet in your phone, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=14.0s)]
*  like boarding a train or... [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=16.16s)]
*  So tech firms are offering services [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=20.88s)]
*  that are usually associated with banks, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=22.88s)]
*  but they're doing it differently. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=24.8s)]
*  It's really about data. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  When a company like Apple or Google [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  processes a payment for you, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=29.2s)]
*  they find out a lot about you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=30.6s)]
*  They know what you bought, where you bought it, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=32.44s)]
*  what time of the day or what day of the month [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=34.44s)]
*  you're likely to spend money, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=36.12s)]
*  and that's really valuable information for advertisers. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=37.16s)]
*  Also, banking is another way for tech firms [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  to draw customers further into their universes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=42.84s)]
*  So Facebook started out as a way to talk to your friends [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  and then became a place where you shared baby photos [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=49.04s)]
*  with your grandparents, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=51.04s)]
*  and now you can shop on Facebook properties, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=52.28s)]
*  you can message, Instagram, WhatsApp. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=54.16s)]
*  Amazon is the same way. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=57.16s)]
*  It started out as a big store, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=58.48s)]
*  and now they make home speakers, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=60.16s)]
*  they make original movies and television shows. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  So these companies all started off with one thing, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=64.2s)]
*  and they're adding more things around it, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=66.72s)]
*  and finance is kind of the last frontier. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=68.72s)]
*  As more people change their banking habits, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=71.56s)]
*  tech companies say they can bring something to the table. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=73.64s)]
*  Google says it will build helpful tools [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=76.44s)]
*  while relying on partnerships [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  to navigate the financial world. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=80.08s)]
*  For its part, Apple promises to eliminate fees [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  for its credit card and give you cash back instantly. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=84.16s)]
*  And the Apple Pay app will have charts [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  that help users track their buying habits. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=89.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Facebook-backed Libra Association [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=91.16s)]
*  says that using a blockchain to process transactions [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=93.68s)]
*  could make cross-border payments cheaper and faster. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=96.72s)]
*  The company says its planned cryptocurrency, Libra, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=99.48s)]
*  could provide banking services for billions of people. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=102.4s)]
*  That plan has faced headwinds. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=105.48s)]
*  Several early partners dropped from the project, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=106.88s)]
*  and US Fed Chairman Jerome Powell [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=109.08000000000001s)]
*  raised concerns with the plan, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=110.88s)]
*  saying that Facebook's size could make Libra [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=112.28s)]
*  immediately systemically important. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=114.44s)]
*  That size is on display in the other services, too. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=117.16s)]
*  According to projections from Juniper Research, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=120.12s)]
*  Google Pay is on track to have 100 million users [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=122.48s)]
*  worldwide in 2020. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=125.0s)]
*  By that time, Apple Pay could have 227 million users. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=126.92s)]
*  Both would be huge increases from 2018. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=130.72s)]
*  These tech companies are already really big, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=133.8s)]
*  and some regulators think too big. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=136.04s)]
*  Several US regulatory bodies [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=138.0s)]
*  already have antitrust investigations [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=139.8s)]
*  into Google, Apple, Facebook, and other big companies. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=141.84s)]
*  Their push into banking could sharpen those concerns. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=145.24s)]
*  And public trust is an issue, too. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  A poll from McKinsey & Company suggests [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  that a slight majority of respondents [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=152.24s)]
*  would trust Google and Apple to handle their finances, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  but Facebook fared less well. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=156.68s)]
*  Some people are already wary of giving tech companies [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=158.44s)]
*  access to their location and their photos. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  Financial data is just way more personal. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=162.8s)]
*  More concerns over privacy and power will be on display [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=165.28s)]
*  as tech firms get into finance. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=168.44s)]
*  The data are valuable, and increasingly, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=170.88s)]
*  they're in the hands of a few tech companies. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KFpUZT7go4&t=173.48s)]
