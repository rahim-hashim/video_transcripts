# How Disney+ Became a Streaming Service Heavyweight  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 09, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks)
*  One of Hollywood's recent breakout stars isn't some up-and-coming actor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=0.0s)]
*  Actually, he isn't even human. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=4.72s)]
*  It's this little guy, Baby Yoda. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=6.88s)]
*  Or that's what fans named the childlike alien from the hit Disney Plus show, The Mandalorian. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=9.28s)]
*  Instantly memeable, the little green character helped make Disney's new show [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=14.88s)]
*  and its new streaming platform a smash hit. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=18.72s)]
*  Since launching in November 2019, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=21.92s)]
*  Disney Plus has surged to the upper echelon of the crowded streaming ranks, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=24.48s)]
*  with 37 million subscribers in the US and over 86 million globally. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=28.64s)]
*  Its success has marked a bright spot for Disney, a company that has lost a little bit of magic. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=33.2s)]
*  In The Mandalorian, characters go to great lengths and take a few risks to keep Baby Yoda safe. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=38.4s)]
*  And in many ways, Disney has made similar moves to help its nascent streaming platform thrive. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=45.92s)]
*  Baby Yoda might have been a new character, but the universe he lives in wasn't new at all. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=52.96s)]
*  Disney owns the Star Wars franchise. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=57.6s)]
*  It's one of the many well-known brands the company packed into its Disney Plus streaming catalog. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=60.08s)]
*  WSJ's Eric Schwartzel has been following Disney Plus' growth. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=64.8s)]
*  The Mandalorian has been the breakout hit of Disney Plus, and it's no surprise because [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=68.8s)]
*  it combines a known entity, the Star Wars universe, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=73.92s)]
*  arguably the most successful franchise in Hollywood history, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=78.4s)]
*  with a new storyline that you can only see and explore on Disney Plus. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=82.0s)]
*  Disney Plus offered 500 films and over 7,500 TV episodes at launch. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=86.88s)]
*  They had this stable of brands that they could already draw on. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=92.24s)]
*  Plus they had movies and characters that people wanted to watch again and again. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  So if Disney Plus became the exclusive home of the Iron Man movies and the Finding Nemo movies, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=101.28s)]
*  that was already a built-in advantage. Then they were able to use those brands and characters to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=108.24s)]
*  make sequels and reboots that become events on the service and give them this perfect bridge [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=112.32s)]
*  of new material using old or familiar characters. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=118.88s)]
*  This helped garner 10 million subscribers on its first day, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=122.72s)]
*  with the Mandalorian driving buzz and acclaim. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=126.08s)]
*  This overnight success couldn't have come at a better time for Disney. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  Even before the pandemic, investors had questioned Disney's long-term growth potential. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=132.72s)]
*  Disney Plus was viewed as a critical venture to help the company capitalize on digital entertainment. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=137.76s)]
*  But with so many streaming options crowding the space, the platform wasn't a surefire bet. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=143.6s)]
*  Here's former Disney CEO and current executive chairman Bob Iger speaking to WSJ in 2019. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=148.64s)]
*  This is a dramatic shift in the way people consume entertainment and information. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=155.84s)]
*  Your business is going through the same thing, right? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=161.28s)]
*  And it requires an immediate shift in strategy in order to stay healthy, in order to thrive. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  Investors were looking at companies like Netflix and seeing those as companies where there was a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  lot of growth. Whereas Disney, despite ruling the box office and having theme parks that had to turn [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=177.6s)]
*  people away if they were so popular, had a major issue with cord cutting. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=183.52s)]
*  This cord cutting was felt most by Disney-owned cable network ESPN. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=188.0s)]
*  And as cable subscriptions fell, Disney's stock price became more volatile. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=192.48s)]
*  Wall Street wanted to see a strategy for growth and a strategy for the future. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=197.52s)]
*  And that is what led executives to conceive of Disney Plus and launch it in 2019. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=201.68s)]
*  So when the pandemic hit, with Disney shuttering theme parks and no theaters open to screen movies, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=208.16s)]
*  its share price took a dive. With people staying home, revenue shrunk, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=213.52s)]
*  and Disney Plus quickly became more important to the company's bottom line. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=217.36s)]
*  Without those traditional revenue streams, Disney Plus was leaned on even harder as a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=221.6s)]
*  place to look to for investors as something that might keep the company afloat. And frankly, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=227.36s)]
*  it has worked incredibly well. So well that Disney announced a [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=232.88s)]
*  massive restructuring of the company, positioning streaming as a top priority. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=236.88s)]
*  Essentially, what we want to do is separate out the folks who make our wonderful content [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  based on tremendous franchises from the decision-making in terms of where [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  the prioritization is in terms of how it gets commercialized into the marketplace. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=252.88s)]
*  This included redirecting high-profile releases like Hamilton and Mulan from theaters onto its [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=257.68s)]
*  platform. They reorganized the company in a way such that there is now an almost agnosticism [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=263.04s)]
*  about where a movie or TV show will run. It is more about creating that show, building that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=276.24s)]
*  programming, and then deciding would this be best in a theater, would this be best on a TV network, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  would this be best on Disney Plus? And increasingly, Disney Plus is the preferred option. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=288.0s)]
*  This strategy seems to have energized Wall Street. Despite posting two consecutive quarters of losses [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=293.36s)]
*  in 2020, including losing over $2 billion in its park division, Disney's stock price has rebounded. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  In November, it announced plans to lay off 32,000 employees by March 2021, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=306.32s)]
*  mostly in its parks division. It also said it would be suspending its January dividend [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=311.36s)]
*  to invest more heavily in streaming. On top of this, Disney Plus set a projection of 260 million [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=316.08s)]
*  subscribers by 2024. But experts question how realistic this forecast actually is. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=321.76s)]
*  A Disney spokesperson said in a statement that with a rapidly expanding pipeline of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=328.0s)]
*  exceptional original programming in the works, the company believes it will significantly expand [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=332.4s)]
*  its global subscriber base. What they're trying to do now is figure out what they can do in terms [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=337.67999999999995s)]
*  of pricing and also what they can do in terms of international growth, because that is where a lot [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=343.52s)]
*  of the new subscribers are going to be coming from. There are some challenges ahead. For one, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=348.64s)]
*  it remains an incredibly competitive landscape and no one really knows yet how many sub-streaming [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=353.44s)]
*  services the average consumer might want to subscribe to. And the other question becomes, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=359.68s)]
*  what is temporary and what is permanent when it comes to the way viewing habits have changed [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=365.6s)]
*  during the pandemic? Questions like these will test whether Disney can navigate a post-coronavirus [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=370.64s)]
*  business landscape and if Disney Plus can not only be the most magical, but also the most streamable [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=376.08s)]
*  place on earth. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVuBMhXhLks&t=381.52s)]
