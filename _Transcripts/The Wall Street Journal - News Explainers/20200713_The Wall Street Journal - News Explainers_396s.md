Video Description: Economists have long used letters of the alphabet like V and U to describe economic recoveries. But the coronavirus downturn is so different from past recessions that economists are coming up with new shapes to describe the potential recovery. WSJ explains. Illustration: Jacob Reynolds

# Alphabet Economics: Why the Old Rules of Recoveries May Not Apply | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 13, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A)
*  If you watched the news, you've probably been hearing about alphabet economics. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=0.0s)]
*  — V-shape. — That V-shape. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=5.8s)]
*  — The W-shape. — The U-shape. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=7.2s)]
*  Or the dreaded L-shape. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  This is how economists talk about economic recoveries. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=12.0s)]
*  And it's not just jargon. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=15.56s)]
*  These letters drive policy decisions at Congress and the central bank. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Decisions that can help determine how far we fall and how quickly we rebound. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=21.32s)]
*  But the coronavirus downturn is different from past recessions. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=26.68s)]
*  In fact, it's so different that economists are having to come up with new shapes [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=30.2s)]
*  to describe the potential recovery. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=33.92s)]
*  When economists study a rebound, they often look back at previous recoveries for insight. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  Here's a look at change in the U.S.'s gross domestic product over the past century. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=43.84s)]
*  You can see these letters appear in different places on the chart. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  Look at 1953. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=52.36s)]
*  In the midst of an economic boom, the Fed raised interest rates to prevent inflation. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=54.4s)]
*  And the economy saw a sharp contraction, followed by a quick recovery in 1954. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  This is the V. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=65.16s)]
*  — V is preferable. What it means is that right after you have the downturn, you bounce right back. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=66.8s)]
*  In a V-shaped recovery, we would get back to the previous high of GDP [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=71.36s)]
*  and the previous low of unemployment within a matter of months instead of a matter of years. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=76.16s)]
*  Experts say it's possible that we could see a V-shaped recovery from the current recession. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=81.16s)]
*  — There are always signs that we got in May suggested we weren't bouncing back from a very deep hole. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=85.72s)]
*  There's a chance people just come back and try to get back to business. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=91.56s)]
*  Some of their income has been replaced by the government, by government paychecks. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  And so they could come right back, but it's not a certainty. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  — Jump ahead to the early 1980s, when the Fed pushed interest rates higher to battle inflation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  The GDP dipped down in 1980, spiked back up, and then plummeted even further before recovering at the end of 1982. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=109.92s)]
*  You can see this formed a W-shaped recovery. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=118.44s)]
*  — The Fed was pushing up interest rates to get inflation down, but it didn't work. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=121.88s)]
*  They had to go back at it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=125.88s)]
*  And it wasn't really until the end of 1982 when the Fed was in a position where it could cut interest rates aggressively [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=127.2s)]
*  and get the economy back on track again. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=134.76s)]
*  — The Fed is in a different position this time because they've cut interest rates very aggressively already. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=136.8s)]
*  There's no inflation on the horizon. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=144.24s)]
*  — If we see a W this time, it will likely be for different reasons tied to the coronavirus. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=146.8s)]
*  — If the second wave comes in and people stop going out and factories have to shut down again [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=152.68s)]
*  and governments start putting on more restrictions, that could stall the expansion that we started to see in May and June. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=157.56s)]
*  — But there are other options, too. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  Look at 2009 at the period following the last financial crisis. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=167.88s)]
*  The economy declined steeply when the housing bubble burst and took nearly two years to recover. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=172.48s)]
*  This is known as a U-shaped recovery. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=178.56s)]
*  — What could cause a U-shaped recovery this time is you have to come back to the coronavirus. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  If we continue to see high caseloads and high hospitalization rates, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=187.0s)]
*  it might be that people are very slow to get back to business normally, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  and that we just don't climb out of this very quickly. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=195.76s)]
*  — So those are the traditional shapes of alphabet economics. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=198.64s)]
*  But again, this downturn is different, and economists are looking at other shapes to try to describe it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=202.24s)]
*  — Our economy got hit by an outside shock, the coronavirus, and we just shut it down. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=208.16s)]
*  It was almost like a meteor hit the economy. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=213.44s)]
*  — One of these shapes is the swoosh, where the economy falls quickly, rebounds a little, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=216.88s)]
*  but then takes months or even years to recover fully. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  — I think what would cause a swoosh-like expansion is that all the uncertainty that comes out of what we just experienced, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=225.88s)]
*  the way people think about, for instance, do I want to live in a city anymore? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  The way a business thinks about, you know, do I want to invest in an urban area [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=239.0s)]
*  or someplace where it might be safer and not as congregated? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=244.84s)]
*  — That it takes years potentially for people to get back into our comfort zone [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=249.0s)]
*  where the economy is functioning at its full capacity. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=253.24s)]
*  — And it may take even longer than that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=256.8s)]
*  Some economists say this recovery could look more like a reverse square root sign, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=259.52s)]
*  where it drops and then rebounds partially before flatlining for a prolonged period of time. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=264.2s)]
*  If you look at the economic activity index from earlier this year, you can kind of see it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=270.12s)]
*  — It dropped sharply in March and rebounded partially before appearing to start to flatten out. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=275.16s)]
*  But it's too soon to say if it will flatline. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=280.48s)]
*  — I would say a reverse square root sign would mean, in the early stages of the recovery, a quick bounce back. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=283.16s)]
*  And we have seen that in May and June. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=289.36s)]
*  But then as it proceeds, it flattens out. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  So we don't get all the way back to where we were, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=294.32s)]
*  because businesses and households come out of this less willing to spend and invest, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=298.0s)]
*  because the coronavirus doesn't go away. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=303.04s)]
*  — The path of a recovery isn't just an abstract shape. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  It helps policymakers determine how much stimulus money to pump into the economy. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=309.56s)]
*  — If the Fed was confident that we were going to have a V-shaped recovery, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  then they would start raising interest rates sooner than they otherwise would. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=318.88s)]
*  They would stop doing their bond-buying programs sooner than they otherwise would. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  If they think it's going to be a long and slow and drawn-out recovery [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=327.72s)]
*  that holds down inflation, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=331.88s)]
*  then they're going to keep interest rates really low for a longer period of time. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=333.64s)]
*  It's fundamentally important, because if the Fed is determined to hold down interest rates [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  because it thinks it's going to be a slow recovery, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  then that will hold down the rate that you pay on your mortgage. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=344.88s)]
*  That will hold down the rate that you pay for a car loan. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  — To protect millions of unemployed Americans, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=353.88s)]
*  the Fed has signaled plans to keep interest rates close to zero through 2022. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  — The worst casualty economically in a recession is the person who loses his or her job. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=361.6s)]
*  And so this affects everyone who's out of work and wants to get back on the factory floor, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=368.84s)]
*  wants to get back into the restaurant, wants to get back in the office. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=374.32s)]
*  — Congress's decision about whether to approve more economic relief for these workers [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=378.72s)]
*  will depend on the shape of the recovery. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=383.2s)]
*  — And as the coronavirus cases rise across the country, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=385.88s)]
*  that shape remains uncertain. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EVeDdH00A&t=389.4s)]
