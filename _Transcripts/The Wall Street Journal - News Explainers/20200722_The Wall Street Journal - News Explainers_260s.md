# The Trouble With TikTok on U.S. Phones  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 22, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY)
*  Here's what would actually happen if TikTok got banned. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=0.0s)]
*  Is it terrifying? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Hashtag save TikTok. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  TikTokers have been taking to TikTok to express their fears over a potential US ban. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=9.64s)]
*  Similar to India where the app was blocked in late June for cybersecurity concerns, they [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=14.92s)]
*  are worried they'll no longer have access to the fun, music and video-driven app. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=18.8s)]
*  The Trump administration has indicated that it's considering similar action, or at least [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=23.56s)]
*  limiting Americans access to the popular app. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=27.68s)]
*  With respect to Chinese apps on people's cell phones, I can assure you the United States [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=30.32s)]
*  will get this one right too. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=34.12s)]
*  So here's why the US is concerned about TikTok on American phones. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=35.44s)]
*  TikTok is China's first global social media sensation. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=41.36s)]
*  In just a few years, it has quickly vaulted into the top app download ranks, neck and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=45.04s)]
*  neck with other popular apps. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=49.92s)]
*  But with this kind of popularity has come increased scrutiny from Washington. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=52.08s)]
*  TikTok collects everything from the device you're using to access the app, your IP [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=56.56s)]
*  address, the messages exchanged with other users on the TikTok app itself. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=60.64s)]
*  And to be very honest, that is not very different from what Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and other [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=66.36s)]
*  social media apps are collecting. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=72.16s)]
*  The difference with TikTok is its ownership. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  Its parent company is ByteDance, which is based in Beijing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=76.64s)]
*  TikTok doesn't have a headquarters, although its CEO sits in Los Angeles. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=80.36s)]
*  The US government's legal system allows it to request user data from companies. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=84.64s)]
*  What worries foreign governments is the fact that the firewall between user data and the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  Chinese government is completely removed because of these laws. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=92.96s)]
*  And that means American private data might end up in the hands of the Chinese government. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  What Beijing could do next with this trove of American data is also a concern. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  US officials are concerned that the Chinese government could be building a vast database [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  of information based off whatever they've gotten from TikTok users. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=110.84s)]
*  And that pool of information might be potentially used for more nefarious means such as espionage. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=115.0s)]
*  TikTok has said that the Chinese government has never asked the company for user data [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=121.64s)]
*  and would refuse such a request. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=125.84s)]
*  The company also said its data on American users is held in servers outside of China, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=127.8s)]
*  in the US and Singapore. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=133.04s)]
*  There are also concerns about freedom of expression. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=135.8s)]
*  Among the fun, quirky videos uploaded to TikTok every day, some users say that some videos [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=138.88000000000002s)]
*  have been censored. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=144.0s)]
*  The journal found that in the last two years, employees at TikTok followed rules that included [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=145.72s)]
*  striking out content that was in line with censorship norms in China, for example, showing [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=149.96s)]
*  tattoos or excessive cleavage, and politically sensitive topics including the Hong Kong protests [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=155.08s)]
*  or Tiananmen Square. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  Recently, the app has been censoring other types of content too. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  We found one US user who said she was banned from her account because she had kissed her [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=166.52s)]
*  girlfriend on the cheek. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  And this happened during a live stream on TikTok. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=172.52s)]
*  And TikTok basically told her after that her account was banned for serious pornography. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  TikTok said that moderation decisions are in an effort to keep the tone on the app lighthearted [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  and not in the name of censorship. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=185.32000000000002s)]
*  TikTok isn't facing only scrutiny from the US. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=188.28s)]
*  TikTok is facing a possible ban in Australia. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=191.08s)]
*  The Dutch Data Protection Agency is launching an investigation into TikTok. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=194.64s)]
*  Where pressure grows, TikTok is taking measures to distance itself from its Chinese roots. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  There's now an American CEO at the head of TikTok. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=203.88s)]
*  His name is Kevin Mayer and he comes from Disney. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=206.88s)]
*  And ByteDance is also considering other changes to its corporate structure. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  People familiar with the discussions tell us that ByteDance is thinking of establishing [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  a headquarters for TikTok outside of China. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=218.0s)]
*  As the US and China clash over coronavirus, citizens' rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=221.32s)]
*  the South China Sea and trade, tech has become a major sticking point. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=226.64s)]
*  And after Huawei and ZTE, TikTok has become the latest giant to be threatened by the US [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=231.04s)]
*  government. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=236.28s)]
*  And the ones who will watch particularly closely how TikTok handles the politics of the global [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=237.28s)]
*  marketplace will be its fellow Chinese tech companies. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=241.2s)]
*  What's really interesting here is that ByteDance is arguably the most successful Chinese internet [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=245.12s)]
*  And should the app be banned, it doesn't bode well for other Chinese companies who [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  are seeking to go global. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRVasd-QPY&t=255.04000000000002s)]
