# How Carnival Has Been Hit by the Coronavirus Crisis | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 24, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY)
*  This is the Diamond Princess cruise liner. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=0.0s)]
*  In February, the ship became an early flashpoint [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=4.08s)]
*  for the coronavirus outbreak. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=6.8s)]
*  Passengers and crew were quarantined [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=8.8s)]
*  as more than 700 of the estimated 3,700 people on board [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=10.64s)]
*  tested positive for COVID-19. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=14.74s)]
*  The now infamous ship is owned by Carnival, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=17.6s)]
*  the largest cruise operator in the world. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=20.32s)]
*  Multiple cruise ships have experienced [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=23.56s)]
*  a coronavirus outbreak on board, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=25.68s)]
*  including several owned by Carnival. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=27.88s)]
*  Since the coronavirus outbreak hit, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=31.0s)]
*  the number of cruise ships sailing around the world [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=33.2s)]
*  has fallen drastically, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=35.36s)]
*  leaving the cruise operator in a precarious position. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=36.92s)]
*  But in the face of a pandemic, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=40.56s)]
*  health authorities and passengers are questioning [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=42.36s)]
*  whether cruise operators can set sail safely going forward. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Carnival began its history in 1972 [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=49.8s)]
*  as a cruise liner with a single ship, the Mardi Gras. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  Up until then, the industry was separated, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=56.68s)]
*  small operators doing their own thing. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=60.6s)]
*  Carnival was revolutionary because it made cruising [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  affordable to people from every walks of life. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=68.0s)]
*  Carnival fueled an industry-wide shipbuilding boom [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=72.48s)]
*  in the 1980s and branded itself [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=75.28s)]
*  as the world's most popular cruise line. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=77.6s)]
*  The cruise operator went public in 1987, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=81.02s)]
*  and throughout the next decade, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=84.08s)]
*  he acquired or bought stakes in several cruise lines, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=85.32s)]
*  amassing a fleet of over 100 cruise ships today. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=88.16s)]
*  They would compete directly with the hospitality industry, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=91.8s)]
*  offering a different product. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=96.6s)]
*  And throughout the past two decades, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  the company has weathered disease outbreaks. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  We were told by our waiter that over 200 people [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  had already been to the infirmary. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  And I was sick for five days. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  As well as natural disasters and accidents at sea. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=108.32s)]
*  In 2012, the Carnival-operated Costa Concordia [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=112.68s)]
*  ran aground in Italy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=116.0s)]
*  The accident killed 32 people. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=118.0s)]
*  It was sinking so fast, and where we were standing [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=120.92s)]
*  is actually underwater right now, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=122.92s)]
*  so obviously we needed to get off right then. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=124.04s)]
*  Then in 2013, the company hired Arnold Donald [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=126.4s)]
*  to write the ship as CEO. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=129.88s)]
*  Under Donald, Carnival's market value [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=131.96s)]
*  nearly doubled to $45 billion in 2017. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=134.08s)]
*  We brought them together in having a common strategy [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=138.32s)]
*  of what they offer, applying a way to control costs [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=143.64s)]
*  across all those brands. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=149.16s)]
*  Over the past years, the cruising industry [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=151.48s)]
*  has been adding at least one million [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  new passengers every year. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=157.12s)]
*  But in 2020, coronavirus became a major concern [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  for the cruise industry early on. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=163.68s)]
*  There are two cruise ships that have been quarantined, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=165.84s)]
*  including the one right here in Hong Kong behind me, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=167.88s)]
*  as well as one in Yokohama, Japan. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=170.24s)]
*  The fear is that coronavirus is spreading. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=172.2s)]
*  Carnival and other cruise operators [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=174.84s)]
*  began canceling voyages in Asia. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  But as reports of virus outbreaks aboard cruise ships [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=179.24s)]
*  like the Diamond Princess kept spreading, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=181.96s)]
*  its parent company largely continued [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=184.2s)]
*  full steam ahead into March. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=186.2s)]
*  They were not prepared for coronavirus [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=188.4s)]
*  because nothing like this has hit them before. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=190.0s)]
*  They could not evacuate thousands of passengers. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=192.56s)]
*  They could not deal with a rapidly spreading epidemic. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=196.64s)]
*  The CDC declared a no-sale order on March 14th, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  and Carnival's stock price has fallen [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  through the first few months of the year. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  To stay afloat, the cruise operator has been raising cash [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=211.04s)]
*  through bond sales and has furloughed or laid off employees. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=214.27999999999997s)]
*  And the company's sales revenue is expected [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  to drop significantly in 2020. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=220.72s)]
*  Carnival said it plans to resume some sailings [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=224.0s)]
*  on August 1st, despite a congressional inquiry [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=226.4s)]
*  into the cruise operator's health and safety practices. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=229.4s)]
*  It's a matter of trust. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=232.8s)]
*  So it will take a lot of convincing and a lot of guarantees [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=234.28s)]
*  and above everything some time for the clients to return. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=238.72s)]
*  And they're counting that people's memories [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=244.16s)]
*  for unpleasant events is short. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=246.88s)]
*  With the coronavirus pandemic continuing, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=249.32s)]
*  what the cruise industry looks like going forward [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=252.0s)]
*  remains to be seen. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sb3XPXmaKY&t=254.72s)]
