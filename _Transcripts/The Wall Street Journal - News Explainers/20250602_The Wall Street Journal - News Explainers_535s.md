Video Description: Space debris landing on Earth have sparked safety concerns on the ground about where it is going to land. In February, an upper stage of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket was breaking up as it made re-entry over Europe and debris scattered across multiple locations in western Poland. The European Space Agency believes up to 200 tons of space hardware re-enters the earth’s atmosphere uncontrolled every year. 
As space launch traffic reaches all time highs, WSJ spoke with space industry experts, who explain whether uncontrolled re-entries could be an accident waiting to happen.

# Your Chances of Being Hit By Junk From Space Is Low, But Never Zero | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4)
*  What is that? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh my god! [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=2.0s)]
*  Space debris is falling to Earth in record numbers. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=4.0s)]
*  While most objects burn up on re-entry, a small percentage survives to strike the ground. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=7.0s)]
*  There's a feeling we are not safe, and it's true. Even the risk is small. It's there. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=13.0s)]
*  Recent examples of space debris hitting the surface of the planet have sparked safety concerns. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=18.0s)]
*  Where is it going to land? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=24.0s)]
*  As space launch traffic reaches an all-time high. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=25.0s)]
*  It's not a question of if, it's a question of when. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=28.0s)]
*  So just how dangerous is space debris to humans on Earth? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=32.0s)]
*  Early morning on February 19th, people in Germany, the UK, Denmark and Sweden reported seeing bright objects streaking across the sky. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=40.0s)]
*  An upper stage of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket was breaking up as it made an uncontrolled re-entry over Europe. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=49.0s)]
*  We're top of the Falcon 9. Go SpaceX, go Starlink. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=57.0s)]
*  It had been launched from California and was intended to re-enter Earth's atmosphere in a controlled descent over the ocean. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=60.0s)]
*  But a propellant leak caused the rocket's second stage to remain in orbit longer than planned, leading to its uncontrolled re-entry weeks later. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=67.0s)]
*  Poland's space agency said debris scattered across multiple locations in the country's west. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=76.0s)]
*  We call it an uncontrolled re-entry for a good reason because you cannot predetermine where it will form. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=82.0s)]
*  The European Space Agency believes up to 200 tonnes of space hardware, including defunct satellites and spent rocket stages, re-enters the Earth's atmosphere in an uncontrolled manner every year. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=88.0s)]
*  200 tonnes is a lot. It basically means there's almost a daily event of a larger object coming back. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=100.0s)]
*  We hardly notice, but it does not mean that nothing will happen because 20 to 40 percent of that mass can reach the ground on average. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=108.0s)]
*  Experts say the chances of that debris striking a human are very low. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=118.0s)]
*  About 70 percent of the Earth's surface is ocean and large parts of land are uninhabited. But there is still a risk and it is growing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=122.0s)]
*  We're launching more. It's got to go somewhere. So it's going to go up or it's going to come down. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=131.0s)]
*  Darren McKnight is a senior technical fellow at US space tracking firm Leo Labs and Andrew Monham heads space environment sustainability for UMETSAT, a European weather satellite agency. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=136.0s)]
*  They co-authored this study on ground hazards caused by space debris re-entry. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=149.0s)]
*  We've looked at both kind of past hazards and let's say expected hazards going forward. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=154.0s)]
*  And we are living in an era where we are somewhat blissfully unaware of a number of objects which are raining down on us. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=160.0s)]
*  An analysis of re-entries over 13 years shows there's nearly a three percent chance that someone somewhere on Earth will be injured each year. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=171.0s)]
*  It's frightening. We have the prospect that something might be falling on our heads. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=180.0s)]
*  But so far, although several thousand tons of space hardware have re-entered in an uncontrolled way since the beginning of spaceflight, nobody was harmed. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=185.0s)]
*  The European Space Agency says for an individual the chances of being injured by space debris is less than one in 100 billion. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=195.0s)]
*  But despite this, there have been some close calls, like this one in Florida. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=203.0s)]
*  In 2024, a piece of debris discarded by the International Space Station three years prior crashed through the roof of a home in Naples. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=209.0s)]
*  NASA said it was part of a 5,800 pound cargo pallet containing batteries that was expected to fully burn up on re-entry. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=218.0s)]
*  That's a clear case where there could clearly have been a casualty of someone who had been in the vicinity. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=230.0s)]
*  Incidents like these have forced space agencies and companies to re-evaluate re-entry models to better predict whether objects will burn up during re-entry. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=237.0s)]
*  SpaceX made changes to some expendable components of its Dragon spacecraft after some proved more resilient than expected. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=246.0s)]
*  The trunk module, which carries unpressurized cargo, is jettisoned before the spacecraft returns to Earth. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=254.0s)]
*  But there have been instances where parts of the trunk have survived and crashed into the ground in Canada, Australia and elsewhere. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=261.0s)]
*  A roughly nine-foot piece was found wedged in the ground here in New South Wales. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=268.0s)]
*  SpaceX subsequently moved its Dragon splashdowns from the coast of Florida to the coast of California, allowing the trunks to be jettisoned in the Pacific. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=274.0s)]
*  The company said it would also implement material changes to some components of Dragon's trunk to improve the probability of it burning up on re-entry. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=283.0s)]
*  Space debris that is made of low melting point materials like aluminum will generally burn up or demise at high altitudes during re-entry, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=292.0s)]
*  while more heat-resistant components made from materials like titanium, stainless steel and beryllium could potentially reach the ground. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=301.0s)]
*  An increasing number of newer satellites are made with materials that are designed to disintegrate upon re-entry. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=309.0s)]
*  But upper stages in spacecraft which contain tanks, thrusters, this is our problem. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=315.0s)]
*  Humans have been leaving rocket stages, or rocket bodies, in orbit since the dawn of the space age. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=322.0s)]
*  In 1957, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, it also created the first two pieces of human-made orbital debris, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=329.0s)]
*  the satellite and the rocket that brought it to orbit. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=338.0s)]
*  The result of over 60 years of subsequent space exploration has been a large number of rocket bodies left in Earth's orbit. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=342.0s)]
*  These are certainly the biggest, most massive objects. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=349.0s)]
*  It's the last stage of the rocket that very often ends up orbital like the satellite that it carries. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=352.0s)]
*  This is a digital representation of the more than 20,000 objects in low Earth orbit by US space tracking firm Leo Labs. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=359.0s)]
*  It illustrates satellites, rocket bodies and debris that can reach speeds of 18,000 miles per hour. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=367.0s)]
*  And these are just the rocket bodies. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=374.0s)]
*  It's the old big stuff. Back in the 80s and the 90s, the bigger the better. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=377.0s)]
*  Those things that come up and they're slowly filtering their way down. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=383.0s)]
*  Based on the altitude of rocket bodies in orbit, Monom expects 32 to re-enter the atmosphere in the next year, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=386.0s)]
*  and a total of 270 in the next 50 years. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=393.0s)]
*  We're talking about bodies which could be three, four, five, six tons, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=397.0s)]
*  and a significant part of their mass will survive intact to the Earth's surface. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=402.0s)]
*  It could break up into different pieces and scatter over a larger area. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=409.0s)]
*  Recent uncontrolled Chinese rocket stage re-entries have drawn criticism from international space agencies. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=414.0s)]
*  In 2022, a roughly 22-ton Long March 5B rocket made an uncontrolled descent and broke up with debris landing near the Philippines. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=420.0s)]
*  NASA's administrator at the time, Bill Nelson, said the debris posed significant risk of loss of life and property. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=430.0s)]
*  Months later, another Long March 5B rocket stage made an uncontrolled re-entry, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=437.0s)]
*  prompting Spain to briefly close a roughly 120-mile-wide strip of its commercial airspace, delaying hundreds of flights. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=442.0s)]
*  It just shows we are not prepared really for the problem. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=450.0s)]
*  So these kind of actions are taken because people want to be safe, and the right answer is still to be found. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=453.0s)]
*  Work is being done to reduce the risk. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=460.0s)]
*  Last year, controlled re-entries outnumbered uncontrolled ones for the first time, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=463.0s)]
*  driven largely by increased awareness of space debris hazards and wider adoption of mitigation measures. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=468.0s)]
*  We should not forget that the majority of the problem that we have now is a result of the action of the past, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=474.0s)]
*  which was not so much private, which was more governmental-driven. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=480.0s)]
*  So there is no good and bad, right? So everybody has to act. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=484.0s)]
*  One of the proposed solutions is active debris removal. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=488.0s)]
*  For launch in 2028, the ClearSpace-1 mission is the European Space Agency's bid to capture and safely de-orbit a derelict object. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=492.0s)]
*  Active removal is the starting point. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=501.0s)]
*  If you are able to rendezvous and capture another object in space, you could refuel it, or you could repair it, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=503.0s)]
*  or you could extend the life of a mission. That would be cheaper compared to launching a new spacecraft. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=511.0s)]
*  But until these new methods come online, a question remains whether investment in mitigation efforts [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=517.0s)]
*  and the technology will advance as fast as the risks posed by an increasingly crowded orbit. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRaLMI0SI4&t=523.0s)]
