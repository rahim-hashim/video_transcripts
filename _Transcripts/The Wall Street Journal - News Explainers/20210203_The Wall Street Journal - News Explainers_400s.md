# How Tech Companies Are Revamping the Remote-Work Experience | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 03, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8)
*  You know, products can sometimes get built in a matter of months. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=0.0s)]
*  But culture is built day by day over years and decades. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=5.0s)]
*  And I think it's really important to take a long-term approach to how we think about [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=9.8s)]
*  remote work. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=16.8s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg here is discussing a problem on the minds of many business leaders. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=17.8s)]
*  Research shows that when employees leave places with a high concentration of specialized workers, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=23.06s)]
*  innovation is stifled. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=28.28s)]
*  And as the pandemic continues, more companies are letting workers move far away from the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=30.12s)]
*  office, sometimes permanently. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=33.84s)]
*  So why is proximity important and what are companies doing to adapt to their decentralized [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=36.44s)]
*  workforces? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  Over the decades, tech companies like Apple, Tesla, and Facebook opened offices in Silicon [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  Valley, creating a hub of specialized tech workers. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  Business leaders and economists say that this proximity is key to the success of a new venture. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=52.56s)]
*  Research from the labor economist Enrico Moretti suggests that when specialized workers [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=58.32s)]
*  live near one another, their companies gain a competitive advantage. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=62.72s)]
*  Places like Silicon Valley are very expensive because labor costs more, office space costs [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=66.88s)]
*  more. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=72.8s)]
*  But they also come with a lot of advantages, and especially if you are in the innovation [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=73.96s)]
*  sector. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=78.72s)]
*  There's a growing body of research that points to the fact that firms and inventors and innovators [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=79.72s)]
*  are particularly productive and creative in places like Silicon Valley. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=86.64s)]
*  In a recent paper, Moretti traced the migration patterns and patent filings of more than 900,000 [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=90.56s)]
*  scientists, inventors, and engineers. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=96.72s)]
*  He found that when a worker leaves an industry specialized city, that worker innovates at [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=99.72s)]
*  a slower pace. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=104.0s)]
*  In my day, I'm following the same person over time. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=105.0s)]
*  I'm seeing an innovator or inventor in rural Ohio, in Cleveland, you know, in the small [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=109.0s)]
*  place in the small clusters. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=115.56s)]
*  And I see how many patents they create. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=117.36s)]
*  And then I see that person moving to Silicon Valley or Seattle or Boston. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  And what you see is that the same person becomes immediately significantly more productive. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Moretti says that on average, a worker in a city with many companies in their field [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=130.56s)]
*  will produce better ideas at a faster pace. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=134.44s)]
*  But during the pandemic, people have left tech clusters like San Francisco, some permanently. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=137.56s)]
*  Many say that some employees want to be closer to their hometowns and families. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=143.88s)]
*  Others are looking to save money. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=148.36s)]
*  Though the median price for a one-bedroom rental fell in 2020, San Francisco remains [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  one of the most expensive metro areas in the U.S. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=155.16s)]
*  Over recent years, that's led to a migration from the Bay to places like Sacramento, Las [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=158.96s)]
*  Vegas, and Austin, Texas. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=163.56s)]
*  Companies have had to reimagine how they'll keep innovating while their workforces spread out. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  When you try to measure where innovation comes from, it's hard to force it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=171.68s)]
*  It's hard to tell people we're going to lock you in a room and you're going to be innovative. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=176.36s)]
*  For a decade, Laszlo Bach led people operations at Google. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=180.16s)]
*  In 2017, he launched his own company, Humu. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=183.72s)]
*  Humu develops products that influence worker behavior. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=187.72s)]
*  It's headquartered near Alphabet's campus in Mountain View. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=190.96s)]
*  In my prior job when I was at Alphabet, we talked a lot about what we called casual collisions [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=193.88s)]
*  or moments of serendipity where people casually bump into one another. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=197.96s)]
*  So famously, Google News, which is an aggregator of websites, evolved because following the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=201.84s)]
*  events of September 11, there were two engineers standing in line at a cafe. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=207.64s)]
*  One of them was complaining about how it's hard to keep up with all the news. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=211.72s)]
*  And the other said, I could pull something together. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=214.48s)]
*  Bach says that these moments of serendipity are the building blocks of innovation, but [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=216.84s)]
*  they come most easily in person. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=221.24s)]
*  Bringing people physically together and more importantly, emotionally together is vital, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=223.4s)]
*  a prerequisite for innovation. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=228.32s)]
*  Bach says that innovation in the workplace comes from low affinity distance. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=230.76s)]
*  Affinity distance is central to innovation and productivity. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=235.12s)]
*  It's that sense of closeness, of connectivity, of psychological safety that allows somebody [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  to say, I've got a crazy idea. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=242.68s)]
*  I'm going to try that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=244.76s)]
*  And the challenge with remote work is when you've been around people and hung out with [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=246.84s)]
*  them and talked about their kids and had water cooler conversations, you get low affinity [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=250.72s)]
*  distance. We get closer to one another. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=256.12s)]
*  Some companies prefer to develop those bonds in person and others are leaning into the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=258.92s)]
*  remote experience. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=263.04s)]
*  There's a handful of companies that are saying we're just going to be remote forever. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=264.04s)]
*  We're going to hire people wherever they want to be. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=268.12s)]
*  And that's how it's going to be. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=270.44s)]
*  In the short term, companies are turning to their own products to build community. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=271.84s)]
*  Facebook, for example, is adding workplace friendly features to its portal video conferencing [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=276.56s)]
*  product. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=281.08s)]
*  So we use our own product, our nudge engine, and it's great at finding those little moments [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=282.08s)]
*  where people can actually connect and be human and innovate. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=286.44s)]
*  Humu's nudge product sends messages to employees at specific times to encourage behaviors that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=290.72s)]
*  boost productivity. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=295.8s)]
*  For example, it might send a nudge that suggests changing up weekly virtual team bonding activities. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=297.7s)]
*  By changing the prompt or the type of event every month or two or three months, you refresh [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=304.16s)]
*  the experience and you help bring people together. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=310.04s)]
*  Other companies are cutting down on avoidable meetings and designing workflows that accommodate [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=313.16s)]
*  people who live in different time zones. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=317.36s)]
*  An example of this might be having a really, really clear problem statement in a Google [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=319.56s)]
*  document and a proposed solution to that and having multiple people being able to weigh [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=324.72s)]
*  in on that document, giving comments on their own time and then that being sufficient enough [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=330.68s)]
*  for the project leader to synthesize all that information and make the next iteration of [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=336.12s)]
*  that proposed solution. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=342.48s)]
*  Dominique Baillet shapes the employee experience at Coinbase, a San Francisco tech company [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=344.0s)]
*  that is now remote first. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  She says it's an opportunity to make the workplace more efficient for people who may have otherwise [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=351.08s)]
*  been marginalized. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=355.4s)]
*  Even if work environments had been remote friendly before, remote first creates a more [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=356.79999999999995s)]
*  equitable playing field to root out some of the systemic disadvantages of not being in [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=362.08s)]
*  the office when the majority of your colleagues are in the office. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=366.2s)]
*  At other companies like Facebook, corporate offsite gatherings could invert into onsites [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=370.96s)]
*  for remote workers at headquarters. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  But Alphabet, for example, plans to have workers return to the office when it's safe. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  Studies conducted by economists say that after the pandemic, about 25% of all full workdays [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=383.2s)]
*  will be performed from home. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=387.92s)]
*  In the meantime, companies will keep revamping the remote experience. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBkya5GqN8&t=390.12s)]
