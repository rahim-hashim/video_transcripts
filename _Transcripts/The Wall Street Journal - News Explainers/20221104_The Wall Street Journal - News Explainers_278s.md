# Why Natural Gas Tankers Are Lining Up Off Europe's Coast | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8)
*  These are GPS markers of liquid natural gas tankers in the English Channel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=0.0s)]
*  Many are idling or sailing slowly, much like this other cluster in the Gulf of Cádiz off [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  the coast of Spain. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=12.72s)]
*  Each of these ships is carrying enough liquefied natural gas to heat a million homes a month, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=14.780000000000001s)]
*  but they can't unload their cargo, at least not right now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=19.64s)]
*  At lots of states, the economy would really nosedive if stores of gas were to run out. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=22.44s)]
*  So what's behind these tanker traffic jams? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=28.84s)]
*  And what might they mean for Europe's energy needs this winter? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=31.8s)]
*  European nations are racing to store natural gas, a commodity the continent relies on to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=36.96s)]
*  fuel its factories, power its cities, and heat its homes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=42.28s)]
*  But recent supply chain bottlenecks threaten to undermine Europe's energy security. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=46.84s)]
*  Until recently, Europe relied on Russia for about 40% of the natural gas it used to heat [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=52.6s)]
*  its homes and power its industries. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=57.86s)]
*  But this year's Russian war in Ukraine threw Europe into its biggest energy crisis since [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=60.58s)]
*  the 1970s. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=65.52s)]
*  Before the war, about half of the Russian gas that ended up in Europe via pipeline was [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=67.52s)]
*  transported by the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which runs under the Baltic Sea, connecting [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=71.62s)]
*  Russia's Siberian gas fields to Germany. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=76.18s)]
*  But in June, Russian gas giant Gazprom began reducing gas flows through the pipeline. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=78.98s)]
*  We are working on the worst possible scenario. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=84.34s)]
*  Then, in September, Russian indefinitely suspended natural gas flows to Europe via Nord Stream. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=89.42s)]
*  Later that month, European authorities released footage of the Baltic Sea bubbling amid reports [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=95.42s)]
*  of unexplained leaks from the Nord Stream pipelines. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  It was a deliberate act of sabotage. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=103.42s)]
*  Putin has launched Russia's first mobilization since World War II. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=106.86s)]
*  And since many months, he is using energy as a weapon. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=111.26s)]
*  Western governments and intelligence agencies haven't yet named a suspected culprit. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=114.78s)]
*  With the pipelines no longer operational, European leaders have turned to other countries, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=119.68s)]
*  like the United States and Qatar, to supply the continent's natural gas. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=124.06s)]
*  But rebuilding Europe's natural gas supply chain hasn't been easy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=127.9s)]
*  To begin with, there are not enough regasification terminals for the tankers to offload their [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=131.3s)]
*  gas. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=136.02s)]
*  Regasification terminals are huge plants built on the coastline. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=137.02s)]
*  They take in liquefied natural gas tankers, they turn that liquid gas back into a gas [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=139.82s)]
*  and pump it into the domestic network. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=144.14s)]
*  There are quite a few of them in Europe, but they're not distributed evenly. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=146.26s)]
*  You have a lot in the UK, in Spain and in Portugal. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=149.14s)]
*  You don't have any at all in Germany. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  Compounding the issue is a lack of storage. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=154.1s)]
*  Europe simply does not have enough space to keep the gas. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=156.78s)]
*  Europe does have a lot of gas in storage. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=160.42s)]
*  It stores gas in caverns, underground and in tanks. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=162.34s)]
*  For the past half century, Europe has been able to rely on a very steady supply of Russian [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=165.66s)]
*  gas, so there was no need to build even bigger storage facilities. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=169.54s)]
*  For now, many of these giant ships are serving as temporary offshore gas storage facilities, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=174.34s)]
*  which has resulted in part from a market dynamic known as contango. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=180.22s)]
*  Contango is a technical term used by traders for a situation where a commodity costs less [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=184.82s)]
*  if the trader sells it tomorrow than it costs if the trader agrees to sell it in several [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  months' time. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=195.32s)]
*  It's a way in which the market encourages traders to hold onto a commodity such as gas [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=197.3s)]
*  to store it for when it is needed later in the year or early next year. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=203.3s)]
*  This chart tracks the difference between liquid natural gas prices next month compared to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=209.34s)]
*  prices in two months' time. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=213.62s)]
*  As you can see, on September 15th, a trader would make $3.42 per million British thermal [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=215.7s)]
*  units if they held their tanker at sea until November, rather than if they offloaded the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=221.66s)]
*  gas in October. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=226.22s)]
*  A month later, on October 13th, that gap had more than doubled to about $7.50 per million [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=227.45999999999998s)]
*  British thermal units if they sold in December rather than in November. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=233.54s)]
*  The original target was to fill storage facilities to 80% of their total capacity by November [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=238.05999999999997s)]
*  1st. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=243.57999999999998s)]
*  That target has been met and exceeded far ahead of schedule. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=244.7s)]
*  The latest data suggests storage is now at nearly 95% in total. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=247.61999999999998s)]
*  Liquid natural gas prices have plunged more than 70% since hitting an all-time high in [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=252.78s)]
*  late August, after storage facilities across the continent filled close to capacity. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=257.26s)]
*  But there isn't enough storage to get through winter if several things go wrong, for example, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=262.5s)]
*  if it's very cold, if Russian supplies stop altogether, and if supplies from Norway or [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=266.9s)]
*  the U.S. get disrupted in some way. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjt0OEmnu8&t=272.86s)]
