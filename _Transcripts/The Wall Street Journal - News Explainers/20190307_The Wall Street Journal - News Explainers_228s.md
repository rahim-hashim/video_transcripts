# Four Things You Need To Know Before Buying Your Next Airline Ticket  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 07, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk)
*  Buying airline tickets can be maddening, but new studies are providing clues into the inner [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=0.0s)]
*  workings of airline ticket pricing, and some of the findings may surprise you. Here are [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=8.8s)]
*  four things you need to know before buying your next airline ticket. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=13.74s)]
*  Number one, non-stops are cheaper. In the past, flights with one or more stops have [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=18.46s)]
*  had lower fares than the most convenient non-stop options, but those days are over for the most [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=24.18s)]
*  part. The reason is simple, airline flights are full. Airlines would rather fill seats [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=29.68s)]
*  on each flight with non-stop passengers since they don't have to split the fare between [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=35.36s)]
*  two or more flights. Take a trip between Boston and San Francisco, for example. If the airline [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=39.72s)]
*  sells one passenger a $400 ticket between Boston and, say, Dallas, and another passenger [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=45.68s)]
*  a $400 ticket between Dallas and San Francisco, it ends up with twice as much money than one [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=52.04s)]
*  passenger on a $400 connecting flight from Boston to San Francisco. It doesn't always [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=58.12s)]
*  work out that way, but for the most part, you can now click that non-stop only box with [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=63.699999999999996s)]
*  pride and confidence and still save money. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=68.94s)]
*  Number two, stay over on Saturdays. A study by Expedia and Airlines Reporting Corp compared [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  trips in the same markets that included a Saturday night and trips that didn't. They [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=79.84s)]
*  found that while staying over on a Saturday doesn't guarantee a low fare, on average, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=84.82s)]
*  airline tickets were 25% less expensive if you included a Saturday night stay. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=90.46s)]
*  Number three, forget about oil prices. Fuel prices account for roughly one quarter of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=96.3s)]
*  an airline's operating budget. In the past, airfare and oil prices moved together, and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=101.35999999999999s)]
*  savvy travelers could wait for oil prices to drop before buying airline tickets. But [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=106.63999999999999s)]
*  two new studies both show that's no longer the case. If you see oil prices jump higher, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  there's no need to wait to buy tickets. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=117.42s)]
*  And finally, number four, buy on the weekend. For years, Tuesday used to be the day to find [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=119.8s)]
*  the cheapest tickets. Airline pricing executives would come to work on Monday, tally up weekend [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=125.34s)]
*  sales and launch a sale with newspaper ads on Tuesday. Nowadays, pricing is largely an [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=131.12s)]
*  automated 24-7 business, and airlines can tailor their best prices to specific days. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=137.02s)]
*  Expedia and ARC looked at about half of all tickets sold in the U.S. and found that in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  general fares can be as much as 20% lower if you buy on the weekend, and actually up [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=149.82000000000002s)]
*  to 36% lower if you buy on a Sunday. The highest prices tend to be on Thursdays and Fridays. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  Airlines know that business travelers usually only buy during the work week, while the most [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=163.98s)]
*  price-sensitive leisure travelers buy on weekends. Other recent studies by booking app Hopper [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=169.17999999999998s)]
*  and a big data analytics firm called 3 Victors looked at prices found in searches, not actual [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=175.26s)]
*  purchases. They both found that Tuesdays are sometimes still a good bet, since airlines [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=181.33999999999997s)]
*  often run flash sales early in the week. Airline tickets are volatile, so it's still worthwhile [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=187.38s)]
*  to search for deals every day, but if you see a good price on a Sunday, grab it. It's [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=193.42000000000002s)]
*  likely to be the best price you're going to see. And if you're really determined [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=198.94s)]
*  to find the lowest fare, try booking on the weekend, about 3 or 4 weeks before departure. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=202.7s)]
*  That's the sweet spot. So let's recap. If you want the lowest fare, book a non-stop [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=208.18s)]
*  flight on a weekend, at least 3 weeks before departure, regardless of oil prices. And make [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=214.06s)]
*  sure to stay over Saturday. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw_weso-Vdk&t=220.34s)]
