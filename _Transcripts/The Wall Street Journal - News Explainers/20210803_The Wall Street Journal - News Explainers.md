# Why Your Vacation Is So Expensive This Summer  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 03, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU)
*  If you've been itching for a vacation, you're not alone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=0.0s)]
*  Summer holiday travel has surged to levels not seen since before the COVID-19 pandemic. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=3.36s)]
*  The Consumer Price Index, which is the benchmark measure of inflation, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=8.72s)]
*  rose 0.9% in June, the largest one-month increase since 2008. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=12.64s)]
*  Vacation-related expenses weren't spared. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=17.76s)]
*  Prices increased for everything from new cameras and swimsuits to rental cars and hotel rooms. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=20.56s)]
*  We're just have this kind of collective need to get out and about. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=26.48s)]
*  Experts say price increases reflect an economy on the upswing from pandemic lows. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=31.28s)]
*  But higher demand has made some vacation essentials harder to come by. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=36.4s)]
*  Here's why that is and some strategies to help avoid the sticker shock. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=40.24s)]
*  As lockdowns have eased, summer holiday travel has surged both in the air and on the ground. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=45.28s)]
*  AAA says more than 47 million people traveled over the 4th of July holiday weekend, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=50.96s)]
*  which is 40% more than last year. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=56.16s)]
*  But US air travel is still recovering after the pandemic drove it to a virtual standstill. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=58.48s)]
*  Much of the recovery lag has to do with the slow return of business travel. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=64.24s)]
*  However, airlines prepared for an almost normal schedule of flights this summer as [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=68.24s)]
*  leisure travel demand returned, contributing to airfare increasing nearly 25% since last year. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=72.32s)]
*  If you're looking for cheaper airfare, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=79.84s)]
*  WSJ Travel editor Deborah Dunn suggests switching up when you fly. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=81.68s)]
*  The key to finding less expensive airfare is to be really flexible, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  not just traveling on a weekend or traveling from a Saturday to Sunday. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  But I would look at the price difference if you fly on a Tuesday or Wednesday. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=97.76s)]
*  But once you're all booked and touched down at your destination, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  you still may hit those higher prices. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  Vehicle rental prices are up over 87% from a year ago. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=108.48s)]
*  The simple reason is that rental companies have less cars. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  Smaller rental fleets had one big issue. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=116.4s)]
*  Summer demand surged over 300% in some cities, according to Kayak. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=119.12s)]
*  This has led some travelers being turned away at the rental counter because there aren't [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  enough cars on the line. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=128.32s)]
*  And with the semiconductor shortage continuing to hamper new car production, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=130.16s)]
*  some analysts think it will be well into 2022 before fleet supplies are enough to meet demand. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=134.0s)]
*  Book months and months ahead. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  And I wouldn't book a non-refundable reservation. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=142.88000000000002s)]
*  The other possibility is to look at picking up a car in town rather than in the airport. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  You'll have to take an Uber from the airport, but it's still day to day, probably a better deal. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  Those with their own set of wheels could count themselves lucky if they weren't facing the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=160.0s)]
*  steepest gasoline prices in nearly seven years, as gas shortages have plagued many regions. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=164.0s)]
*  The Colonial Pipeline cyberattack in May led to East Coast shortages right before the summer season. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=169.76s)]
*  And some regions of the country have had a hard time restocking gas stations because of a lack [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=175.12s)]
*  of truck drivers, many of whom had been laid off during the pandemic, according to analysts. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=179.6s)]
*  And the high prices aren't restricted to travel expenses. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=184.8s)]
*  Men's and women's swimwear prices were up 1.4 and 5.5% respectively, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=188.32s)]
*  which analysts attribute to pent-up vacation demand. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=193.68s)]
*  Demand outpacing supply has hit other vacation essentials as well, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=196.56s)]
*  like cameras, which have risen in price by almost 6%. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=200.72s)]
*  And depending on where your head hits the pillow, you could be paying more for accommodations. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=204.72s)]
*  Room rates have recovered to pre-pandemic levels, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=209.68s)]
*  but the slow return of business travel has kept occupancy rates slightly lower than before the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=212.88s)]
*  pandemic, according to analysts. And while demand may be high in traditional destinations like [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=217.36s)]
*  Florida and Hawaii, experts say price increases are being driven by vacationers booking bigger [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=222.8s)]
*  accommodations that may be off the beaten path. Travelers are opting for larger hotel suites or [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=227.68s)]
*  entire rental houses to accommodate families vacationing together. And according to AirDNA, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  which tracks short-term rental prices of Airbnb and Verbo, demand in small cities in rural [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=238.0s)]
*  locations has surged over 51% since 2019. The current vacation season is being defined [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=243.52s)]
*  by an economy in recovery and a population desperate for some R&R, even if it puts a dent [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=249.68s)]
*  in their wallets. Be flexible about where you're going to go, when you're going to go, how long [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=255.44s)]
*  you're going to stay. Flexibility, I think, is the operative word this summer. The last thing you want [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=260.56s)]
*  to be is stressed out on vacation. But if prices continue to rise, a stress-free vacation may be [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=266.24s)]
*  harder to come by. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0CFaCXksU&t=271.84000000000003s)]
