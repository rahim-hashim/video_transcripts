# Twitter Isn’t Making Money. Here’s Why Musk Thinks It Could Soon.  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y)
*  This is why Twitter has $13 billion in new debt that it took on at the end of 2022. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon Musk didn't start Twitter's problems. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=7.76s)]
*  It hadn't booked an annual profit since 2019. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=12.48s)]
*  But in the months after that tweet, its finances have drained. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=16.76s)]
*  Revenue fell an estimated 40% year-over-year in December. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=21.0s)]
*  Still, Musk is projecting optimism. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=25.28s)]
*  I think we've got a shot at being cashflow positive next quarter. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=28.04s)]
*  But just how possible is that? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=34.12s)]
*  Let's look at Twitter's cashflow before and after Musk's takeover to see how its revenue has changed. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=37.08s)]
*  And why he insists Twitter will take flight again soon. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=42.96s)]
*  Twitter's cashflow problems started before Musk's takeover of the company. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=48.64s)]
*  It had posted a loss in eight of the last 10 years. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=52.8s)]
*  The last full year that we have figures for is 2021. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=56.52s)]
*  They booked about $5 billion in revenue and also booked about $5.5 billion in costs, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=60.88s)]
*  which goes to show that the company's finances even before the takeover were a little stressed. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=67.08s)]
*  But for the money it was making, it relied heavily on advertising. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  Take a look at the second quarter of 2022. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=78.08s)]
*  Advertising accounted for more than 90% of Twitter's revenue. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=81.16s)]
*  Fast forward to October, when Elon Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=86.04s)]
*  That buy saddled the company with that $13 billion in debt. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  Analysts estimated at the time that this would put Twitter on the hook for annual interest payments of more than $1 billion, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  compared to $51 million in 2021. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=105.04s)]
*  The debt is going to drain the company's resources. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=108.16000000000001s)]
*  He added a huge burden to the company's finances. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=111.6s)]
*  Musk came in with big ideas for Twitter, including cutting down its reliance on advertising revenue and focusing on subscription services. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=116.55999999999999s)]
*  But one idea that he focused heavily on was promoting what he refers to as free speech. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  Musk began reinstating accounts that had been banned for tweets that violated policies and limiting content moderation. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  Twitter has become a little bit more of a chaotic platform and place since Elon took over. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=138.56s)]
*  Last year saw a slowdown in online marketing that affected many platforms, due to people spending less time online and broader economic concerns. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=144.16s)]
*  But Twitter had additional issues. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  Because some of Musk's changes didn't sit well with some big advertisers. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=155.56s)]
*  Within weeks of the takeover, companies including Chipotle and United Airlines had pulled back or paused their ad spending on the platform, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  hurting Twitter's primary source of revenue. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  Advertisers are really focused on brand safety so that when their ads appear online or anywhere for that matter, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=171.48s)]
*  they want to know that the content that it's surrounding is not offensive or not inflammatory. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=178.72s)]
*  Musk has said Twitter must be a respectable platform for advertisers and Twitter says brand safety is a priority. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=186.56s)]
*  While advertisers fled, Musk was taking stock of his new company. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=194.08s)]
*  He said in early November that Twitter was losing four million dollars a day. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=198.4s)]
*  Because I'm just thinking about like, how do we, I just, you know, just get Twitter to be in a financially healthy place. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=203.0s)]
*  The main way that's being addressed, we're told, is through cost cutting. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=212.32s)]
*  Twitter went from about 8000 employees before the sale to around 2000 in December. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=216.84s)]
*  But these job cuts have come with their own price. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  When you just fire whole teams and take them off the site, suddenly there are people who had expertise in running a very complicated machine that are not around anymore. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=225.64s)]
*  And it's not a surprise that there have been unexpected, unplanned outages. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=236.52s)]
*  Twitter hasn't said much about recent outages, but the company responded to a request for comment with this. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=241.56s)]
*  Aside from cost cutting, Twitter has made moves to grow revenue. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=248.96s)]
*  Please subscribe to Twitter verified eight bucks. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=253.0s)]
*  And actually, it's technically at 799, so slightly less. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=256.68s)]
*  In December, it relaunched its paid subscription service, Twitter Blue. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=261.56s)]
*  As of March, it's estimated that the subscription service has about 450,000 users, according to Travis Brown, a software developer who tracks social media platforms. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=266.2s)]
*  Now, Twitter Blue is $11 for mobile phone users. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=276.64s)]
*  We haven't seen a big uptake of Twitter Blue yet. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  There aren't enough incentives yet or reasons to join Twitter Blue to cause a mass sign up. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=284.36s)]
*  So Musk is also appealing to advertisers to come back to the platform. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=291.64s)]
*  What I'd say to advertisers and brands is, you know, use Twitter yourself and believe what you see on Twitter, not what you read in the newspapers. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=295.92s)]
*  Because what you see on Twitter is the real thing and what you read in newspapers is not. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=304.88s)]
*  Currently, Musk says the company earns five to six cents an hour spent by its users on the platform, an amount Musk isn't satisfied with. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=309.0s)]
*  Still, he sees potential, saying there will be a massive increase in revenue because it is now useful. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=317.92s)]
*  He sincerely believes that through targeted advertising, more specific forms of content instead of just general ads for the public writ large, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=324.8s)]
*  advertisers will spend more because they feel like they're reaching their target audience on Twitter. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=334.8s)]
*  But are these efforts enough to actually make that happen? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=339.0s)]
*  One analyst says the company could at least break even in nine months based on estimates of recent cost cuts and stabilizing ad revenue. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=342.84s)]
*  Twitter could also negotiate down its interest payments and Musk could contribute more of his personal wealth. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=351.92s)]
*  But whether the company books a profit depends on what direction Musk takes. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  He wants to turn it into like an everything platform where you can essentially integrate commercial activity with reading the news, with talking to friends. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=362.8s)]
*  And I think that's the long term vision. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=373.0s)]
*  But first, he's got to be sure that the company can pay its bills. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=375.08s)]
*  And that is still a bit in question. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4ztNAEP6Y&t=378.24s)]
