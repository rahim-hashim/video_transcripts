# Want to Make a Big Bet on Oil Prices? Try Measuring Shadows  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 08, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI)
*  This is the world's largest oil processing plant, located in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=0.0s)]
*  Early on Saturday, September 14th, a series of explosions rocked the facility and the world woke to see it burning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=8.0s)]
*  Satellite images show thick black smoke billowing from the Aramco oil facility in Abqiq. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=15.0s)]
*  The nation's state-run oil company, Saudi Aramco, has temporarily closed its facilities, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=21.0s)]
*  which many experts expect will cause a lack of supply leading to higher global oil prices. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=26.0s)]
*  But while the world was looking over here, energy traders on Wall Street and elsewhere were also looking over here, and here, and here. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=32.0s)]
*  At thousands of storage sites around the world were companies and countries stockpile oil. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=42.0s)]
*  What's inside these tanks can be valuable information for traders, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=47.0s)]
*  who make big bets based on how much supply is available and where in the world it's located. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=52.0s)]
*  For traders, an event like the one in Saudi Arabia can be an opportunity. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=57.0s)]
*  So in the event of market crisis situations or disaster events, there's a natural increase in volatility, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=62.0s)]
*  and we do see increased interest from our client base and from prospective clients. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=69.0s)]
*  Mario Della Ossa is an energy specialist at Orbital Insight, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=73.0s)]
*  a company that estimates the tank's contents using satellite imagery, artificial intelligence, and a lot of complicated math. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=77.0s)]
*  I guess we're quite proud of our coverage levels, which are on the order of seeing about 80% of the world's oil tanks every week. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=84.0s)]
*  Orbital is at the vanguard of firms that sell data to hedge funds, energy companies, and others who are looking to anticipate oil price moves. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=91.0s)]
*  To get their hands on the data, the first thing Orbital had to do was find as many of these tanks as it could. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=99.0s)]
*  Employees train computers to spot them by feeding them image after image of oil tanks. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=105.0s)]
*  Once the computers got the picture, they scanned satellite imagery and found more than 25,000 tanks around the world. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=110.0s)]
*  Orbital is constantly collecting images of each tank, which its computers then examine to estimate their contents. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=117.0s)]
*  The key to doing that lies in the shadows, particularly those cast upon the tops of the tanks. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=123.0s)]
*  A floating-roof tank goes up and down according to the volume of oil that's inside of the tank, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=129.0s)]
*  and that's done to prevent a vapor space from forming that would be very bad in terms of explosion risks. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=134.0s)]
*  Orbital's computers measure the shadows cast on and around the area of each tank. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=140.0s)]
*  The shadow cast to the outside is used to determine the size of each tank, which can range from 50,000 barrels to more than a million. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=145.0s)]
*  The shadow cast inside the structure is used to measure how much oil is inside the tank. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=153.0s)]
*  Generally, the bigger the shadow, the less oil there is inside. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=158.0s)]
*  So we have that going for us that where the position of the roof is, it will correspond to the volume of oil inside of the tank. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=162.0s)]
*  But then to actually calculate the specific volume, this does become complex in terms of aligning the exact position of the satellite, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=169.0s)]
*  the position of the sun to adjust for the shadow length that was cast. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=178.0s)]
*  Orbital then adds up the volumes and compares them over time, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=182.0s)]
*  noting when stockpiles grow and shrink in different regions. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=186.0s)]
*  The company is able to do this quickly, beating official reports by weeks and sometimes even months. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=189.0s)]
*  And they can offer insight to parts of the world where supply data are scarce or suspect. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=195.0s)]
*  So how much is there in, let's say, Cushing, Oklahoma? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=200.0s)]
*  And that's fairly well tracked. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=203.0s)]
*  What's not fairly well tracked, and this is one of the big problems for people in the marketplaces, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=205.0s)]
*  how much oil is in China? Because the Chinese don't openly disclose that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=209.0s)]
*  Historically, 80% of the market has just been very, very dark. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=213.0s)]
*  Knowing how much oil is out there and where it's stockpiled is useful to a range of businesses. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=220.0s)]
*  Energy producers use it to decide whether to drill wells. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=224.0s)]
*  Refiners that turn crude into products like gasoline and jet fuel want to know when to buy their main ingredient. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=228.0s)]
*  Hedge funds and other speculators simply want to make money. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=234.0s)]
*  These traders might act on clues that stockpiles are dwindling by buying oil now and selling it later [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=238.0s)]
*  once other buyers realize supplies are low and the price goes up. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=243.0s)]
*  Predicting changes in the availability and thus the price of oil can be incredibly lucrative. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=247.0s)]
*  Andy Hall, who advises Orbital, is one of the most successful and well-known oil traders of recent decades. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=252.0s)]
*  He made a fortune buying boatloads of cheap oil before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=258.0s)]
*  which touched off the first Gulf War and sent crude prices soaring. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=264.0s)]
*  Traders like Hall are always looking for ways to gauge oil supply. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=268.0s)]
*  They count the rigs that are drilling wells and measure what's passing through pipelines. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=272.0s)]
*  They train cameras on import and export loading docks and count tankers moving through waterways, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=277.0s)]
*  like the Houston Ship Channel and the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=283.0s)]
*  Firms like Orbital have taken this kind of detection to a whole new level. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=287.0s)]
*  Before the attacks on Saudi Arabia, Orbital observed a lot of shrinking shadows on the tops of the kingdom's oil tanks, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=291.0s)]
*  suggesting that it was building up its stockpiles. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=298.0s)]
*  But after the attacks, the shadows began to grow, which meant that Saudi Arabia was tapping reserves to satisfy customers. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=301.0s)]
*  But the firm didn't just look there. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=308.0s)]
*  It looked at China, where tanks were full, and the US, which were also well stocked, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=310.0s)]
*  and in Japan and South Korea, which were not, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=315.0s)]
*  and in India, where the shadows were growing as imports from Saudi Arabia dwindled. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=318.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, back on Wall Street, and in Houston and London and Singapore, traders placed their bets. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgqJTTmVZI&t=323.0s)]
