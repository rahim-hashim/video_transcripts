Video Description: A massive heat dome across the American Southwest is driving temperatures in Phoenix and Las Vegas to record triple-digit highs. New Maxar satellite photos show how the growth of these large cities is contributing to the extreme weather. The combination of a heat dome on top of a heat island means being outside can be even more dangerous.

WSJ explains the science behind heat domes and how urban growth can make that heat even more deadly.

**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg)
*  Land west of Phoenix looked like this in 2002. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=0.0s)]
*  Now it's covered in buildings. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=4.44s)]
*  Phoenix, along with Las Vegas, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=6.88s)]
*  is experiencing a stretch of triple-digit temperatures [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=8.84s)]
*  made worse by a heat dome. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Record-level temperatures. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Shows no signs of letting up. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=15.32s)]
*  Unrelenting grip on the country. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=16.96s)]
*  A lot of our cities have gotten bigger [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=18.92s)]
*  in the last 20 years, especially in the Southwest. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=21.2s)]
*  Here's what happens when heat domes form above cities [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  and how urban growth can make that heat even more deadly. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=26.28s)]
*  In Phoenix, over 20 days in July [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  have been at or above 110 degrees. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=33.36s)]
*  And space technology company Maxar, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=36.36s)]
*  which has been tracking the weather, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=38.52s)]
*  predicts the city will hit at least 30 [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=40.0s)]
*  by the end of the month. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=42.0s)]
*  In Las Vegas, 16 days are predicted to hit that high. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=43.68000000000001s)]
*  That heat is driven in part by urban development. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=47.88s)]
*  Imagine a city as an island [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=51.44s)]
*  with pavement, roads, surfaces, glass and steel buildings. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=54.04s)]
*  All of these surfaces reflect sunlight [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=58.64s)]
*  and the heat energy from the sun back into the air around. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=61.44s)]
*  These highly developed areas can see midday temperatures [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=65.24s)]
*  that are 15 to 20 degrees warmer [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=68.4s)]
*  than surrounding vegetated areas. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=70.72s)]
*  We can see how these heat islands formed [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=73.48s)]
*  by looking back at Phoenix. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=75.4s)]
*  Here it is 23 years ago. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=77.12s)]
*  But after two decades of urban growth, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=79.44s)]
*  the city has ballooned. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=81.48s)]
*  Back in 2000, Las Vegas looks like this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=84.0s)]
*  And now its city limits have expanded. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=87.8s)]
*  That expansion paralleled their economic growth, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=91.24s)]
*  but more infrastructure turned up the heat. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=94.16s)]
*  These are all places where heat gets trapped, right? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=96.64s)]
*  So in many of these cities, there's not a lot of breezes. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=100.2s)]
*  There's not a lot of shade or trees. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=103.76s)]
*  And so as a result, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  heat can build up in these urban corridors. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=107.56s)]
*  It's sometimes hard to grow trees in the West, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  especially in very arid places. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=114.72s)]
*  And the native trees that grow there [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=117.16s)]
*  may not be great at providing shade. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=118.88s)]
*  So you have a lot of areas that get a lot, a lot of sun. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  The other important thing about plants and trees [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=126.16s)]
*  and vegetation and even grass is they cycle moisture [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=129.44s)]
*  from the ground into the air [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=132.68s)]
*  and help just a little bit keep things cooler. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=134.76s)]
*  That's driven temps in Phoenix and Las Vegas even higher [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=138.32s)]
*  and drove the creation of these heat islands. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=142.16s)]
*  But that's not the only thing fueling the hot weather. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=144.72s)]
*  When you have a heat dome on top of this, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  it really intensifies the temperatures [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=150.72s)]
*  for everyone living in this city. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=153.44s)]
*  These domes are a natural weather phenomenon. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=155.68s)]
*  And for most of July, one has been covering the Southwest. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=158.24s)]
*  A heat dome is a large ridge of high pressure, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=162.04s)]
*  high in the atmosphere, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=165.6s)]
*  that basically traps a lot of hot air underneath it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=167.16s)]
*  And it can last for a long time. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=170.6s)]
*  Over time, the heat dome is basically reinforcing itself [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=172.76s)]
*  in the sense that any moisture on the ground [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=176.96s)]
*  or in the soil that may come up into the atmosphere [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=179.96s)]
*  that perhaps could cause some rain [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  or rainstorms in the afternoon, that's going away. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=185.2s)]
*  The soils are drying out, the land is drying out. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=188.0s)]
*  And so this hot air is making things worse and worse. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=191.32s)]
*  The combination of a heat dome on top of a heat island [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=194.48s)]
*  means that being outside can be even more dangerous. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=197.6s)]
*  Burn centers have reported injuries [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=201.2s)]
*  to people who touch hot door handles [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  and walk barefoot on scorched pavement. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=205.0s)]
*  These are hot places, right? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=207.72s)]
*  And so there's often this feeling of, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=209.6s)]
*  well, it's always been hot here. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  We're used to it. We can deal with it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=212.64s)]
*  But I think that masks some of the really significant risks [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  that are faced by people experiencing homelessness, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=217.72s)]
*  by people who are elderly, people who work outside. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  Many of these different groups that are exposed and vulnerable. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=223.92s)]
*  In cities already experiencing triple-digit temperatures, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=229.12s)]
*  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=232.64s)]
*  is preparing officials for increasing heat events. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=235.84s)]
*  Everybody is very concerned about the future, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=238.96s)]
*  that with warming and with climate change, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  we expect more of these events to happen. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=244.8s)]
*  And when these events happen, they're more intense. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=246.88s)]
*  And scientists say the heat is here to stay. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=249.72s)]
*  As architects, planners and engineers look to the future, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=252.64s)]
*  they have to take into account the effects of climate change over time, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  temperatures that are rising, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=259.4s)]
*  storms and other things that are happening as well. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=260.96s)]
*  So they're taking these things into account [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=263.76s)]
*  with new kinds of technologies, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=265.56s)]
*  green roofs that can absorb and cool buildings, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=267.52s)]
*  and also just in the design and shape of buildings [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=270.64s)]
*  that can provide more shade [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=274.2s)]
*  and maybe just have a little bit of resiliency [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=276.2s)]
*  toward a warming climate that we're all facing in the future. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv6eVvLI4fg&t=278.8s)]
