Video Description: Iran-backed groups connect to form a land bridge across the Middle East and form an alliance that Tehran calls the ‘Axis of Resistance.’ This land bridge can be used to transport equipment and personnel, but also allows for positions in Iraq and Syria to attack U.S. interests or threaten Israel closer to its borders. 

WSJ explains what to know about the alliance that includes Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.

# Hamas, Hezbollah and Houthis: Iran’s ‘Axis of Resistance,’ Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM)
*  Iran-backed groups form a land bridge across the Middle East and connect in an alliance [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=0.0s)]
*  that Tehran calls the Axis of Resistance. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=5.96s)]
*  Its focus? To oppose the West. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=9.16s)]
*  They can both transport equipment and personnel, but they can also use these positions to attack [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=11.4s)]
*  US interests or threaten Israel closer to its borders. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=17.48s)]
*  The alliance has been brought into focus amid the Hamas-Israel war, as the groups are mobilising [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=20.88s)]
*  on multiple fronts at the same time. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=25.68s)]
*  So here's how Iran built out the network across the Middle East and what it means for the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=29.6s)]
*  US and Israel. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=34.28s)]
*  So to show you where Iran's so-called Axis of Resistance works in the Middle East, we [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=37.44s)]
*  have Iran over here and then of course Hamas in Gaza over here on the Mediterranean. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=41.92s)]
*  There's another group that Iran supports in Gaza called the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=49.0s)]
*  which is actually a closer ally of Iran ideologically, but also working out of Gaza here and also [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=53.68000000000001s)]
*  in the West Bank. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=59.36s)]
*  Iran's most important militia ally is Hezbollah here in Lebanon. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=61.2s)]
*  Aside from that, they also have Sirius President Bashar al-Assad here and various militant groups [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=66.96s)]
*  in Iraq. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=74.0s)]
*  And then finally, they also have an alliance with the Houthis in Yemen down here south. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=75.0s)]
*  These connections allow Iran to expand its influence in the Middle East and make it easier [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=81.52s)]
*  for the country to transport military equipment, personnel and weapons through the region. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=85.8s)]
*  One of Iran's aims in the Middle East is to always keep the fight, the military fight, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=91.8s)]
*  as far away from its own borders as possible. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=97.24s)]
*  And the presence of these military allies in the land bridge kind of helps it do that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  To understand why Iran has this belt of influence in the region, we need to go back a few decades. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=104.64s)]
*  Following the Iranian Revolution in 1979, Tehran has sought to exert military, cultural [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=110.56s)]
*  and ideological dominance across the Middle East. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  That led to the creation of the Quds Force, a branch of the Iranian military, which was [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  later led by Qasem Soleimani. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=123.16s)]
*  Soleimani became famous in the West over the past decade or so because Iran decided to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=126.28s)]
*  elevate his profile as the mastermind, the architect behind this modern iteration of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=130.84s)]
*  the axis of resistance. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=137.16s)]
*  Soleimani was killed in a drone strike ordered by the US. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=138.16s)]
*  Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=156.76s)]
*  personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=163.2s)]
*  The strike was aimed at weakening Iran's ability to threaten American interests in [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=169.84s)]
*  Iraq and across the region. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=174.17999999999998s)]
*  But that goal hasn't materialised. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=177.16s)]
*  Iran has continued to supply groups such as Hamas with weapons and training. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  On October 7th, Hamas, designated a terror organisation by the US, launched a broad assault [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=184.56s)]
*  on Israel, killing 1,200. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=190.16s)]
*  Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said immediately after the attack that Iran did not have a [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=194.76s)]
*  hand in planning it, but supported it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=199.48s)]
*  To try and curb Iran's influence, the US works with allied countries to have a presence [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=204.16s)]
*  of bases and troops across the Middle East. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=208.64s)]
*  Of course, Israel here and Saudi Arabia here as the two main and closest allies against [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=211.64s)]
*  Iranian influence. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  Jordan has also for very long been a very firm US ally, and the US also has partners [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=219.56s)]
*  in the Gulf. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=226.04000000000002s)]
*  The US also has a presence in some of the countries where it's competing for influence [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  with Iran, for example in Iraq, of course. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=233.4s)]
*  And the US also still has a military presence in northern Syria, where it's been allied [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  for many years with Kurdish forces in the fight against the Islamic State, but now also [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=241.36s)]
*  maintains a military presence to sort of counter this Iranian land bridge, the threat [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=245.62s)]
*  from Iran to US interests and allies. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=250.9s)]
*  Tehran-backed groups operating in this region have been particularly active since October 7th. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  So let's remove all of these and take a look at what's been happening. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=260.3s)]
*  On October 7th, Hamas attacked Israel here on the border with Gaza. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=263.42s)]
*  Israel responded with a major military offensive on Gaza. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=268.22s)]
*  But Iran's allies have also responded to this Israeli attack from different sides. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=272.26s)]
*  Most importantly, the Hezbollah militia in the northern part with Israel has engaged [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=278.02s)]
*  in skirmishes with Israeli soldiers. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=283.06s)]
*  Iranian militias in Syria have also gotten closer to the border where they have engaged [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=286.58s)]
*  in skirmishes. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=290.98s)]
*  Down here in Yemen, the Iranian allied Houthi rebels have both fired rockets at southern [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=292.34s)]
*  Israel but also captured a vessel in the Red Sea. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=298.34s)]
*  The Houthis also launched drones and missiles at other commercial vessels in the area. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=302.53999999999996s)]
*  That led to a US-led multinational task force stepping in to try and protect one of the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=307.09999999999997s)]
*  world's most vital shipping lanes. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=311.41999999999996s)]
*  And elsewhere, Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria conducted nearly 100 rocket [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=314.0s)]
*  attacks against US forces over the past two months, according to the Pentagon. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=318.78s)]
*  Even though there's been these types of attacks with increased frequency over the past decade [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=323.5s)]
*  or so, in this context, of course, they compound pressure on Israel and help sort of pressure [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=328.3s)]
*  Israel in this context where they are fighting Hamas and Gaza. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=334.82s)]
*  Although Iran's axis of resistance has claimed attacks on multiple fronts amid the Hamas-Israel [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=340.58000000000004s)]
*  war, Middle East analysts believe a wider regional conflict is unlikely for now. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=345.02s)]
*  Even though other parts of this alliance have distanced themselves from the October 7 attacks, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=351.46000000000004s)]
*  the fact that there was a big attack on Israel has given the alliance a bit of momentum but [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=355.9s)]
*  also put a little bit of pressure, to be honest, on some of the other militant groups to both [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=360.26s)]
*  to strike a bit of Israel and to come to the defence of the Palestinians who are now under [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=367.02s)]
*  severe airstrikes and a ground invasion in Gaza. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=372.18s)]
*  So far, groups in the alliance have been sticking to calculated and strategic strikes, rather [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=377.26s)]
*  than moves that could risk a full-blown conflict with Israel and its allies. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek7P0hFzoNM&t=382.1s)]
