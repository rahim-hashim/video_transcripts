# Trump Doubles Down on Agenda in Unapologetic Address: Analysis | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k)
*  President Trump gave a feisty and defiant speech to Congress Tuesday night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=0.0s)]
*  The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=5.44s)]
*  We must have legislation to secure the border. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=11.32s)]
*  But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=14.6s)]
*  Trump was unwavering. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=20.52s)]
*  He was unapologetic. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=21.8s)]
*  He was defiant and he was at ease. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=23.52s)]
*  He was glad to be back in the job. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=26.8s)]
*  And we've ended weaponized government where, as an example, a sitting president [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=29.44s)]
*  is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent, like me. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=34.04s)]
*  How did that work out? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=41.36s)]
*  Not too good. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=43.28s)]
*  Not too good. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=44.68s)]
*  The optics of the night were quite striking. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=45.88s)]
*  It looked, quite frankly, like America. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=50.36s)]
*  It was very divided. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=52.72s)]
*  USA! USA! [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=54.2s)]
*  President Trump spent a lot of time talking about the things he's already done in the first 43 days. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=57.32s)]
*  Illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded. Ever. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  We're getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military, and it's already out. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=68.56s)]
*  And it's out of our society. We don't want it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=75.08s)]
*  But he did not talk a lot about what he wants to do in the next 11 months or even three and a half years. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=78.36s)]
*  And so, filling in those blanks and getting details about the policies and proposals, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=83.72000000000001s)]
*  that's going to be something his administration is going to be challenged to provide. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=87.92s)]
*  We need Greenland for national security and even international security. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=91.44000000000001s)]
*  And we're working with everybody involved to try and get it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  But we need it really for international world security. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=100.2s)]
*  And I think we're going to get it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=104.16000000000001s)]
*  One way or the other, we're going to get it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  President Trump said he wanted Congress, by the end of this year, to renew and extend [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=108.92000000000002s)]
*  the tax cuts from 2017. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=113.56s)]
*  But he didn't explain exactly how he wants them to get the votes. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=115.92s)]
*  And I'm sure that the people on my right, I don't mean the Republican right, but my right right here, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=119.44s)]
*  I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts because otherwise I don't believe [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  the people will ever vote you into office. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=130.2s)]
*  So I'm doing you a big favor by telling you that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=132.56s)]
*  A big part of the night was kind of a made-for-TV theme where he introduced special guests. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=135.36s)]
*  And his greatest dream is to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=141.56s)]
*  Jason, that's a very big deal getting in. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=152.60000000000002s)]
*  That's a hard one to get into. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  But I'm pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  You will soon be joining the Corps of Cadets. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  His name is DJ Daniel. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=169.72s)]
*  He is 13 years old and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=171.44s)]
*  And tonight, DJ, we're going to do you the biggest honor of them all. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=181.84s)]
*  I am asking our new Secret Service Director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=186.44s)]
*  of the United States Secret Service. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=193.52s)]
*  There was an interruption early in the speech. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=202.4s)]
*  Just a few minutes in, Congressman Al Green of Texas, a Democrat, stood up and started [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=205.72s)]
*  shaking a cane at the president. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=210.4s)]
*  It did lead Congressman Green to being removed from the chamber. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=216.32s)]
*  Democrats mostly sat silently, at times challenging things that he said, but frequently just holding [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=222.96s)]
*  up signs. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=228.32s)]
*  The Republicans in Congress seemed very supportive of the steps he's taken so far to cut spending. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=231.16s)]
*  And they were very enthusiastic when Elon Musk stood up and President Trump described [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=235.28s)]
*  many of the programs that he was going to try to eliminate. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  He's working very hard. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=242.16s)]
*  He didn't need this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=243.52s)]
*  He didn't need this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=244.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=246.8s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=247.8s)]
*  Everybody here, even this side, appreciates it, I believe. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=248.8s)]
*  The Republicans in the chamber seemed a little more uncomfortable with his discussion of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=252.4s)]
*  trade and tariffs. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=258.12s)]
*  It's a beautiful word, isn't it? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=260.76s)]
*  The stock market has fallen, the Dow more than a thousand points in the past two days [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=263.24s)]
*  because of the new tariffs that President Trump has imposed on Canada, Mexico and China. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=267.8s)]
*  The tariffs will go on, agricultural product coming into America, and our farmers starting [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=272.72s)]
*  on April 2nd, it may be a little bit of an adjustment period. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=279.0s)]
*  He didn't spend a lot of time at all asking Congress for legislation, for any new proposals. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=284.12s)]
*  He sort of suggested that this approach he's taken in the first 43 days of acting alone [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=289.24s)]
*  through executive actions, that's the kind of presidency that he wants to continue. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=293.8s)]
*  We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=298.36s)]
*  or eight years. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=304.76s)]
*  And we are just getting started. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsfXnAxvZ-k&t=306.56s)]
