# Analyzing Harris’s and Trump’s Closing Arguments  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo)
*  This has been a wild election year and the final week has been a frenzy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=0.0s)]
*  Both candidates were barnstorming the swing states. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=4.48s)]
*  We are not going back. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=7.36s)]
*  Kamala broke it and we will fix it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=10.72s)]
*  It really could come down to a few thousand votes out of 160 million votes cast. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=13.52s)]
*  Are you better off now than you were four years ago? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=19.52s)]
*  No. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=23.12s)]
*  Former President Trump has tried again and again to convince voters that things were [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  much better when he was president and that only he is capable of returning America to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=29.92s)]
*  the kind of prosperity that he promises. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=35.36s)]
*  I will end inflation. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=37.52s)]
*  I will stop the invasion of criminals coming into our country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=39.6s)]
*  Vice President Harris has tried repeatedly to signal two things. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=45.28s)]
*  First, that she's not going to be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  that she represents this new generation. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=52.56s)]
*  And second, that she will reach across the aisle and work with Republicans to try to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=54.96s)]
*  solve problems facing Americans like immigration and the economy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=58.56s)]
*  I will work with everyone, Democrats, Republicans and independents. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  She is trying to convince former Trump voters, independent women, suburban women, suburban men, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=68.0s)]
*  that people who have supported Trump in the past, that it's okay to support a Democrat. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  I see the promise of America in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=79.68s)]
*  On the issue of abortion, this is an issue that Vice President Harris has really tried to own. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  She is saying that because of former President Trump, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=94.4s)]
*  women have fewer rights now than they did before he was president. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  Trump's final message was more dark and this is consistent with the way he's run for the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=103.68s)]
*  presidency in 2016 and 2020. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=107.76s)]
*  Because who would want to have millions of people coming into our country, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=110.08s)]
*  many of them are murderers, many of them are terrorists. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  We're going to do the largest deportation in the history of our country. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  We're going to get all of these criminal deaths. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=122.4s)]
*  Several weeks ago, he had a publicity stunt at a McDonald's and he presented himself as kind of an everyman. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=125.44s)]
*  I like this job, I think I might come back and do it again. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=131.76s)]
*  Fast forward a week later, he has this big rally at Madison Square Garden [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=134.4s)]
*  and that's where things kind of took a sharp turn. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=138.88s)]
*  And the remarks specifically about Puerto Rico by a comedian that turned a lot of Americans off. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=141.12s)]
*  There's literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=147.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's called Puerto Rico. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=152.4s)]
*  That was a situation where the Trump campaign actually had to distance themselves from someone [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=154.96s)]
*  who was at their rally. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=159.6s)]
*  I love Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico loves me. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know anything about it, comedian. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  Vice President Harris, her biggest issue in her closing arguments actually didn't come from anything she said. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=167.28s)]
*  It came from President Biden. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  And that is something that he immediately tried to clean up, but it really kind of electrified [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  former President Trump and his supporters. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=181.68s)]
*  Joe Biden finally said what he and Kamala really think of our supporters, he called them garbage. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=183.68s)]
*  No way. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=190.32s)]
*  No way. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  Trump doesn't really stay on message. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=192.64s)]
*  This is something that he's been doing since 2016. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=194.16s)]
*  He made comments about women and how he would protect them. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to do it whether the women like it or not. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to protect them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=202.56s)]
*  One of the things we've heard a lot from former President Trump in the final days [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=204.56s)]
*  is he is arguing that the election is already being rigged and that votes are being stolen. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=209.12s)]
*  We must stop a radical left agenda with a landslide that is too big to rig. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=213.68s)]
*  And he even said over the weekend that he should never have left the White House [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  after he lost the election in 2020. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=224.56s)]
*  That's something that I don't think I've heard him say before. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=226.64s)]
*  We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=229.28s)]
*  I shouldn't have left. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=233.6s)]
*  I mean, honestly. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=234.56s)]
*  The polls show this race to be so close that no one should be surprised by either outcome. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=236.0s)]
*  We're ready to get out the vote. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=243.04s)]
*  We're ready to win. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  But it's ours to lose. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=248.24s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  It's ours to lose. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=250.32s)]
*  We should not overlook states that don't seem like swing states today. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=251.6s)]
*  There are millions of voters in this country who are going to vote [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  possibly in surprising ways. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=259.52s)]
*  Anything can happen. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=261.52s)]
*  And that's what everyone is preparing for in the election this year. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8angMZlmRo&t=262.71999999999997s)]
