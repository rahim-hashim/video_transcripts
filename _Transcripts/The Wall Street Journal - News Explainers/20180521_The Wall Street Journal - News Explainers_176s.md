# GDPR: What Is It and How Might It Affect You?
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 21, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o)
*  The General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR as you've likely heard it called, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=0.0s)]
*  it goes into effect on May 25th and it could affect you, no matter where you are or where you live. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=7.0s)]
*  How? Let's answer some questions. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=15.0s)]
*  So, what is GDPR? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=19.0s)]
*  It tightens Europe's already strict laws about what companies can do with people's data. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=21.0s)]
*  It gives you more control over how your data is collected and used [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=27.0s)]
*  and forces companies to justify everything that they do with it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=31.0s)]
*  While GDPR is European Union legislation, it has a huge effect on businesses outside the EU, including the US. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=36.0s)]
*  Why was GDPR introduced? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=46.0s)]
*  Because the old laws were written before smartphones started collecting massive amounts of sensitive information [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=49.0s)]
*  for companies like Google and Facebook. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=55.0s)]
*  GDPR gives organisations guidelines on what they can and can't do with personal data. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=58.0s)]
*  It also makes them give users more clarity over the kind of data being used and how companies will use it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=65.0s)]
*  What is considered personal data under GDPR? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=73.0s)]
*  Any data that can identify you. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=78.0s)]
*  That's your name, phone number or username, but the law also includes things like your IP address or location data. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=80.0s)]
*  Even tighter rules apply for sensitive information such as sexual orientation, health data and political opinions. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=90.0s)]
*  How will it affect you? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=99.0s)]
*  One way is that you will often have to opt in to letting a company use your data. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=101.0s)]
*  This means fewer pre-ticked boxes and firms are compelled to use clear and simple language. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=107.0s)]
*  Do people have the right to be forgotten? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=116.0s)]
*  Yes, people can request to have their data deleted. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=119.0s)]
*  Personal data also needs to be transferable via a common file type. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=124.0s)]
*  However, the right to be forgotten is not absolute and certain conditions apply. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=129.0s)]
*  Why is GDPR a concern for non-EU countries? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=136.0s)]
*  Because many businesses collect or use EU residents' data. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=142.0s)]
*  They also use companies based in the EU for services and processing data. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=148.0s)]
*  What happens if a firm doesn't comply with GDPR? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=154.0s)]
*  The penalty could be up to 20 million euros or 4% of annual turnover, whichever is larger. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6wwBqfSk-o&t=158.0s)]
