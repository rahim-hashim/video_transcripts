# How Trump Shooting Shifted Democratic and Republican Election Strategies  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk)
*  In the aftermath of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=0.0s)]
*  the Republican National Convention is kicking off. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=6.48s)]
*  This convention will come to order. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=9.28s)]
*  The shooting marked a shocking new chapter of violence in modern American politics [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  and transformed the rhetoric and campaign strategies in the presidential race. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=20.56s)]
*  The rhetoric from the left was what charged the shooter. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=25.44s)]
*  I thank God that his hand was on President Trump. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=29.28s)]
*  A lot of Republicans blame the Democrats directly for this shooting, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  even though we don't know the case of this particular shooter, what his motivations were. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=37.92s)]
*  Here's a closer look at how the attack has changed the presidential race. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  The assassination attempt on Donald Trump obviously came in the context of what was already [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=47.84s)]
*  a very heightened and tense political climate. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=52.8s)]
*  The fact that both nominees are so unpopular, that has inspired both parties to raise the stakes [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=55.6s)]
*  of the election and to frame it as an existential choice, a fork in the road for the country. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=61.68s)]
*  The rhetoric has just been over the top. It really has. I mean, there's no figure in American history, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=67.04s)]
*  at least in the modern era, maybe since Lincoln, who's been so vilified and really persecuted. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  A lot of Republicans blame the Democrats saying that by casting the election in such [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=78.0s)]
*  existential terms, by referring to Trump as a dictator, comparing him to Adolf Hitler, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=83.36s)]
*  that they struck fear in the hearts of their followers and encouraged or inspired many people [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=88.0s)]
*  on the left to view Trump as an enemy of the republic and therefore to want to potentially [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=93.84s)]
*  take him out. When someone is demonized to the extent that Trump was being demonized, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=99.68s)]
*  you're putting a target on them. It's one side that is going after [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=104.4s)]
*  Donald Trump in a way to demonize him personally. The left seems to have targeted Donald Trump [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=108.0s)]
*  as a person. One of the first to point fingers was the man we now know is Donald Trump's running [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=113.12s)]
*  mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, who even before we knew the identity of the man who fired the shot, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  was out there on social media saying this is the Democrats' fault. The rhetoric of the left was [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=123.12s)]
*  directly responsible for this tragic shooting. Biden's campaign has argued that Trump is a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=128.56s)]
*  threat to democracy. Donald Trump ready to burn it all down. Trump's assault on democracy isn't [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=133.44s)]
*  just part of his past. It's what he's promising for the future. And Trump has used extreme [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=138.48s)]
*  rhetoric throughout his campaign. So over the past few years, you've watched Biden and his [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=143.84s)]
*  band of Marxist, communist, fascist try to crush free speech, censor their critics, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  criminalize dissent, destroy attorney-client privilege. For Democrats, this is all a bit [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=155.04s)]
*  much coming from the party of Donald Trump, who has been, I think it's fair to say, enthusiastic [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  about political violence for much of his career in politics, from encouraging people to beat up [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=166.0s)]
*  protesters at his rallies. You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=171.2s)]
*  like this? They'd be carried out on a stretcher, folks. To egging on the protesters who sacked the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=175.6s)]
*  Capitol on January 6th, 2021. And they say that it's Trump as much as anyone who's led to this kind [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=182.88s)]
*  of a climate. Politicians on both sides of the aisle called for lowering the temperature of the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=189.04s)]
*  rhetoric after the shooting. You know, the political record in this country has gotten very heated. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=193.92s)]
*  It's time to cool it down. But politics must never be a literal battlefield, God forbid, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=199.6s)]
*  a killing field. The sentiments expressed by the president and his remarks just now [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=204.88s)]
*  were very noble, and I hope they follow them. Because if they believe it, they will scale back [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  the rhetoric. The images of the shooting have galvanized Trump supporters. That picture of him [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  standing up with a bloody face, a fist in the air with American flag behind it, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=221.28s)]
*  that's an iconic picture that I think will last a generation. If you strip the politics out of it, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=226.32s)]
*  it really is just an incredible moment. The presidential nominee being gunned down, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=231.36s)]
*  coming within perhaps a quarter inch of losing his life. And as he is being taken to safety by [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=238.0s)]
*  the Secret Service, he turns around, he raises his fist, and you can hear him saying, fight, fight, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=244.56s)]
*  fight. So I think for many people, particularly, of course, Trump supporters, this is an image [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=250.4s)]
*  that they're going to rally around, seeing Trump as a sort of a martyr figure, someone who's been [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=256.72s)]
*  victimized and persecuted, someone that they believe the administration and the left have [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=262.96s)]
*  come after again and again using all of the forces of the state and tried to eliminate in so many [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  ways. And they see him as this triumphant hero who's rising from that fight and encouraging his [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=273.84s)]
*  followers to keep up the fight. The devil came to Pennsylvania holding a rifle, but an American lion [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=280.56s)]
*  got back up on his feet and he roared. So this plays into Trump's entire narrative, that the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=288.96s)]
*  left is out to get him, that everything that he's ever been accused of is a manufactured narrative [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  intended to eliminate him because he poses such a threat to the system, to the deep state, to the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=303.44s)]
*  left. For Trump's followers, who see him as this this martyr figure, as almost a messianic figure, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=309.44s)]
*  this is a very powerful image. I personally believe that God intervened today, not just on [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=315.92s)]
*  behalf of President Trump, but on behalf of our country. Many of the supporters that I talked to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=321.04s)]
*  believe that they see God's hand working for Trump in this situation. And Trump has said this too, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=325.92s)]
*  he's mentioned God many times in his social media posts since coming off that stage where [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=331.92s)]
*  he almost lost his life. If you didn't believe in miracles before Saturday, you better be believing [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  right now, our God still saves, he still delivers, and he still sets free. We all saw what seems to be [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=342.8s)]
*  a miracle. I mean, I believe that God spared him and that bullet went just apparently a millimeter [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=353.76s)]
*  from doing real and permanent damage. Trump is truly blessed by the hand of God being able to evade [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=359.28s)]
*  being assassinated. The attempted assassination came at a crossroads in this year's already [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=368.47999999999996s)]
*  tumultuous presidential campaign. Donald Trump has been the subject of four separate criminal [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=374.08s)]
*  indictments, a couple of civil cases as well, and I think many of us expected that the campaign and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=378.96s)]
*  the months leading up to the election would really be dominated by his legal issues. Instead, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  they've sort of melted away. Now the focus really has shifted to the very real victimization that [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=388.96s)]
*  he faced as the target of an attempted assassination and to his performance in the presidential debate, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  which of course was so catastrophic for his opponent, President Biden. Biden's campaign, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=402.08s)]
*  meanwhile, quickly pulled television ads off the airwaves and paused official communications. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=407.35999999999996s)]
*  Dealing with everything we have to do with, look. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=413.35999999999996s)]
*  The attack also shifted focus away from his debate performance and some Democrats calling for him to [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=417.84s)]
*  step aside. While the presidential race remains close nationally, a recent WSJ poll shows that [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=424.0s)]
*  Trump is leading by six points. Still, election day is months away, and it's unclear how the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=429.67999999999995s)]
*  shooting will affect the final outcome. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7fs19SSuk&t=435.76s)]
