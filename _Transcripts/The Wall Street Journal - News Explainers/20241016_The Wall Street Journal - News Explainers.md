# Why the U.S.’s Thaad is So Significant for Israel  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI)
*  This is the moment a salvo of Iranian-fired missiles descends on Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=0.0s)]
*  Around 180 ballistic missiles were launched, with Israel saying it intercepted many of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=7.24s)]
*  them. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  But some pierced the country's highly advanced air defence systems, like this one seen exploding [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  near the Mossad headquarters and others seen hitting the ground at an Israeli airbase. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=19.66s)]
*  The attacks raised fears that another Iranian assault could inflict major destruction. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=26.68s)]
*  Now the US says it's stepping in to bolster Israel's defences, with a billion-dollar [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=32.28s)]
*  THAAD and troops to operate it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=37.22s)]
*  Air defence experts say the arrival of the interceptor system will significantly aid [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=42.24s)]
*  Tel Aviv in repelling future strikes. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  Here's how. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  The THAAD, or Terminal High Altitude Area Defence, is a ground-based air defence system [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=51.48s)]
*  designed to shoot down ballistic missiles. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=57.12s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal spoke to analysts from think tanks RUCI and CSIS to understand [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=60.0s)]
*  how the system works. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=65.52s)]
*  The THAAD typically consists of six truck-mounted launchers, containing eight interceptors each, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=67.64s)]
*  a transportable radar and a fire control unit. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=73.28s)]
*  It needs nearly 100 soldiers to operate it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=77.88s)]
*  It's being deployed to Israel to strengthen Tel Aviv's already advanced multi-layered [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=80.83999999999999s)]
*  air defence capability, which includes the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Arrow systems. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=85.0s)]
*  These defences, in conjunction with efforts from Israel's allies, were able to fend off [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=92.28s)]
*  an Iranian barrage of missiles and drones in April. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=96.91999999999999s)]
*  But Iran's attack in October, one of the largest such strikes in the history of warfare, overwhelmed [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=101.32s)]
*  the systems in some places. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=107.2s)]
*  Analysts say that's largely due to the speed of the projectiles, most of which were Iran's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  most modern ballistic missiles. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=115.16s)]
*  Essentially, the faster the missile, the harder it is to intercept. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  Iranian missiles have to travel about 550 miles to reach Israel and have so far proved [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=123.56s)]
*  to be relatively inaccurate at such long ranges. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=129.12s)]
*  If Israel is targeted again with more accurate and fast-moving projectiles, the THAAD could [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=133.28s)]
*  help to intercept them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=138.68s)]
*  That's because as well as new missile launchers, the system includes sensors needed to track [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=140.44s)]
*  incoming attacks. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=145.32000000000002s)]
*  Analysts say its radar operates at a higher frequency than the system typically used with [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  Israel's Arrow 3. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=151.68s)]
*  This means the THAAD will increase Israel's ability to cross-check incoming targets for [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=153.72s)]
*  both tracking and targeting. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=158.4s)]
*  Iran's experts say additional radars are important when defending against barrages [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=161.96s)]
*  of missiles like Iran's October attack. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=166.52s)]
*  The THAAD, with a top range of 124 miles, will be integrated into Israel's current [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=171.28s)]
*  air defence system. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  By comparison, Israel's Iron Dome can intercept slower and smaller targets such as drones [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=178.4s)]
*  and rockets and has a range of around 43 miles. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  David's Sling can reach up to 186 miles and is able to intercept large rockets and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=187.12s)]
*  short-range ballistic missiles. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=192.56s)]
*  And Arrow 3, Israel's most advanced system, has a top range of over 1,000 miles. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=195.12s)]
*  The THAAD defends against ballistic threats by operating at a high altitude. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  It can intercept projectiles up to 93 miles high and can operate both inside and outside [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=207.8s)]
*  the Earth's atmosphere. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=213.84s)]
*  This means the THAAD has more time to strike incoming projectiles and launch a secondary [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=215.52s)]
*  interceptor if needed. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  Israel's Arrow 3, which operates in a similar way, can reach up to a height of 62 miles. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=222.16000000000003s)]
*  But despite the Arrow system's ability to intercept ballistic missiles, some still landed [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  within the Nevatim Air Base's perimeter in October. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=235.84s)]
*  It's unclear how many were deliberately ignored as Israel doesn't typically target projectiles [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=239.4s)]
*  headed for empty areas. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=244.28s)]
*  That's largely due to the cost of intercepting them. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=246.28s)]
*  Each Arrow interception costs a few million dollars, according to the maker of the system, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  while the US's THAAD also comes with a heavy price tag, with an estimated cost of $10 million [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=255.48s)]
*  per interceptor. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=261.84s)]
*  Despite its cost, analysts say the THAAD has another key advantage, its interoperability [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=264.76s)]
*  with Israel's current defences. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=270.68s)]
*  The system has previously been deployed in Israel during a US-Israeli military exercise. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=273.04s)]
*  And now US soldiers are set to help operate the system inside Israel, this time during [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=279.32s)]
*  a combat situation. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=285.44s)]
*  Analysts say this is a significant move as it puts American service members at risk of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=287.68s)]
*  future potential strikes from Iran. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  But at the same time, could also deter future Iranian strikes, as Israel becomes more difficult [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=296.24s)]
*  to penetrate. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MdMAHtZZMI&t=303.84000000000003s)]
