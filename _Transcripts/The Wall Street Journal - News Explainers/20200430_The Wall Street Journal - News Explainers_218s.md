# The Latest Consumer-Spending Report, Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 30, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A)
*  The Commerce Department has released its monthly consumer spending report for the month of March. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=0.0s)]
*  Consumer spending drives the U.S. economy and is seen as a key indicator of how deeply the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=5.36s)]
*  current coronavirus crisis is affecting everyday Americans. Personal consumption expenditures, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=10.32s)]
*  or all the goods and services purchased in the United States, was about $12.5 trillion in March, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=17.2s)]
*  down from about $13.5 trillion from the previous month. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=24.32s)]
*  With stores and restaurants being forced to close and jobless claims at record highs, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=28.88s)]
*  consumers are, unsurprisingly, spending less money. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=33.52s)]
*  This consumer spending report is released monthly and economists, investors, analysts, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=37.04s)]
*  all pay a ton of attention to it because of the huge role that spending has on the domestic economy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=42.72s)]
*  Consumer spending makes up about 68% of GDP in the United States. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=50.08s)]
*  This is a really wide-ranging figure. This represents everything from people going to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=56.0s)]
*  the mall to shop at stores to buying groceries to getting haircuts. It's anything you spend your [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=60.24s)]
*  money on. So in March, we saw businesses across the country start to shut their doors and social [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=65.52s)]
*  distancing measures were put in place and people were staying home more than they had, you know, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=71.44s)]
*  maybe ever. So that puts a serious hamper on how much money they are spending. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=77.44s)]
*  Consumer spending was at record highs a few months ago, driven in part by a decade of wage [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=83.27999999999999s)]
*  growth and low unemployment. But U.S. employees shed around 700,000 jobs in March, raising the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=88.88s)]
*  unemployment rate to 4.4%, a number that's expected to increase in April. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  What we're really seeing play out here is kind of this domino effect that spending can have on the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=101.52s)]
*  entire economy. So a lot of people are left jobless. They have less money to spend. That's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=106.0s)]
*  less money that they're putting into the pockets of other people. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=111.6s)]
*  Retail sales were down 8.7% in March, with sales for clothing down as much as 50% from a year ago. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  The U.S. government has tried to offset the impact of this coronavirus downturn with a [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=122.32s)]
*  stimulus package like we've never seen before. And the hope is that people who maybe left jobless or [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=127.2s)]
*  whose income may have taken a hit, they, you know, they might be able to pay their rent or they'll go [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=133.52s)]
*  out there and they'll spend this money to potentially stimulate the economy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=139.68s)]
*  Some analysts say consumer spending can be a lagging indicator of how the economy is doing, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=144.0s)]
*  because it looks at spending from the previous month. But its growth almost always slows heading [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=148.88s)]
*  into a recession. If you look at the last recession, spending dipped during the second half of 2008. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=154.0s)]
*  Consumer spending is obviously a huge chunk of the domestic economy, but how much people are [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  spending also tells you how confident they're feeling about their current economic situation, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=166.16s)]
*  their current jobs, their future jobs. A survey of consumer sentiment plunged around 20% in early [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=171.28s)]
*  April, the largest monthly decline ever recorded. There are some corners of the economy where [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=177.76s)]
*  consumers are still spending while staying at home. For example, they're paying for streaming [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=183.68s)]
*  services and buying things online, benefiting the stock prices of companies like Netflix and Amazon. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=188.32s)]
*  One worry that a lot of analysts and economists have right now is that once businesses are [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=194.4s)]
*  reopened, whenever that might be, that people won't just bounce back and start spending at the pace [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=200.24s)]
*  that they did previously. You know, the worry is that the rebound could be a little bit slower [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=207.04s)]
*  than what many people are expecting right now. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKaNYMbux0A&t=212.88s)]
