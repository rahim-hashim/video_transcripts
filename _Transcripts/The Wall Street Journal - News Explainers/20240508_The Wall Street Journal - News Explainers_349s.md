# Why China’s Land Grab in Bhutan Threatens India | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs)
*  These satellite images show Chinese settlements on the territory of Bhutan, a tiny kingdom in the Himalayas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=0.0s)]
*  The villages sprouting in the north of the country pose a security challenge to India. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=7.76s)]
*  Some regional experts say they could be part of Beijing's pressure tactics to make Bhutan [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  give up a strategic area in the west of the country. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=18.22s)]
*  That would expose a major geographic vulnerability for India, a key land corridor known as the chicken neck. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=21.94s)]
*  Bhutan overlooks this tiny bridge of land about 20 kilometres across, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=29.16s)]
*  which connects the main part of India with India's north eastern territories. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=33.96s)]
*  Over the last few years, China has built military facilities, roads and buildings in northern Bhutan. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=39.68s)]
*  Here's why China is quietly expanding into its neighbours' territory. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=47.2s)]
*  Bhutan is just half the size of South Carolina. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=53.68s)]
*  Yet it is strategically important to both of its powerful neighbours. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=56.56s)]
*  It's historically an ally of India, and it has a long-standing border dispute with China, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  which claims at least three major areas of Bhutan. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=67.2s)]
*  And the claim on this area in the west, known as the Doklam Plateau, puts India on edge. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=70.88s)]
*  In 2017, New Delhi and Beijing nearly went to war when Beijing tried to extend a road in this remote territory [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=77.28s)]
*  bordering China's Tibet. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=84.08s)]
*  It's a high point that would give China ability to oversee India's movement through the Siliguri Corridor, the chicken neck. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=85.76s)]
*  Robert Barnett is an expert on China-Tibet border issues. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  He and his colleagues were the first to identify early Chinese constructions in the north of Bhutan in 2016. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=97.72s)]
*  Barnett says the area could be a bargaining chip to get the Doklam Plateau. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=105.04s)]
*  China says we will give up our claim to these areas in the north if you give us what we want. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=109.84s)]
*  So this is how China creates pressure in negotiation. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=115.72s)]
*  Beijing's expansion in the north of Bhutan started three decades ago with a single hut for four Tibetan herders, according to Chinese officials. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=120.8s)]
*  China's claim to this area was that these Tibetan herders were living in this one hut, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=130.28s)]
*  and now we see that new villages have emerged here. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=135.64s)]
*  This is extremely difficult territory to live in, especially in the rainy season. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=138.76s)]
*  That's why this area has never been settled before, except by hermits and monks and lamas. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=143.16000000000003s)]
*  China has built a network of roads linking at least four quickly expanding villages, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=149.88000000000002s)]
*  as well as constructions that look like military installations. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  Here's a zigzag road that goes to the top of a hill and on top of that mountain is a building. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  We don't know what it's there for, but it presumably is some kind of military listening device. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=165.72000000000003s)]
*  Over the last few years, China has been encouraging more of its citizens to relocate to the new villages. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=171.08s)]
*  Last December, Chinese authorities showed photos of residents of newly built homes holding portraits of the country's leader. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  What's very extraordinary about this is that these buildings are getting faster and faster and more and more buildings are cropping up. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=184.36s)]
*  It's possible that China has decided it has military advantage from holding this area. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=191.4s)]
*  In other words, it's not just a pressure tactic to force Bhutan to give up Doklam. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=197.0s)]
*  It's also an opportunity for China to set up military listening posts south of the Himalayas, which will give it advantage over India. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=203.64s)]
*  In late March, India's Prime Minister visited Bhutan to shore up ties with the kingdom, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=214.36s)]
*  as Beijing tries to increase its influence there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=219.64s)]
*  Bhutan doesn't have formal diplomatic ties with China, but recently the two neighbours have been intensifying their dialogue. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=222.76s)]
*  In October 2023, the Bhutanese foreign minister visited Beijing. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  As a result, the two sides expressed their mutual desire to complete border talks as soon as possible. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  Some Chinese experts on the region previously said New Delhi had hindered Bhutan's and China's efforts to settle their border disputes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=241.88s)]
*  India is extremely concerned about the Doklam plateau. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=250.36s)]
*  Bhutan and India have a treaty, 2007, which says that Bhutan has to respect security needs of India. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  So Bhutan can't easily give up Doklam if India objects and India has objected. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=261.48s)]
*  Beijing said the purpose of its infrastructure construction on what it called the Chinese side of the China-Bhutan border area [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=266.52s)]
*  is to improve people's livelihood and has nothing to do with the China-Bhutan border negotiations. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=273.64s)]
*  India's Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn't respond to requests for comment [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=279.56s)]
*  on whether New Delhi considers China's expansion in northern Bhutan as a threat. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=283.64s)]
*  Bhutan's embassy in New Delhi said it doesn't comment on the ongoing border talks between Bhutan and China. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=288.68s)]
*  But it added that the government of Bhutan will always uphold and safeguard [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  the country's territorial interests during the boundary negotiations. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=299.08s)]
*  Some people think the Bhutanese have already given up those claims to those areas, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=303.16s)]
*  but we have to wait and see. Bhutan's just had an election, so there's a new prime minister. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=307.64s)]
*  He's much closer to India than the previous government was, so there may be a slight change in tactics. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=311.88s)]
*  But overall it looks like China has realized there is no way that Bhutan can give it Doklam. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=319.0s)]
*  Therefore it looks like China expects to hold on to that territory in the north [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=328.76s)]
*  and it looks as if Bhutan will have to just give up that claim that it's had for many centuries probably in that area. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9xe7N_OEXs&t=333.8s)]
