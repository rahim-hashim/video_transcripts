# How Nvidia's AI Strategy Fueled Its $1 Trillion Valuation  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw)
*  This is the exclusive trillion-dollar company club. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=0.0s)]
*  It's made up of some of tech's biggest giants. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=3.44s)]
*  And for a moment on May 30th, this company, Nvidia. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=6.72s)]
*  It's not a household name, but one day in late May, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=11.24s)]
*  Nvidia added nearly $184 billion in market value. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=14.6s)]
*  That's a single-day sum worth more than other companies [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=19.8s)]
*  in the semiconductor industry, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=22.92s)]
*  and just a fraction of its total value. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=24.76s)]
*  The company's record sales have been fueled [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=27.880000000000003s)]
*  by an emerging technology. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=30.48s)]
*  We're the world's engine for AI. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=32.28s)]
*  Here's how an under-the-radar graphics processor [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  is cashing in on the AI craze, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=37.800000000000004s)]
*  and what's next for its strategy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  When Nvidia was founded in 1993, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=44.52s)]
*  it established itself as a leader [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=47.44s)]
*  in graphic processing units, or GPUs, for video games. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=49.52s)]
*  The company's powerful chips made images crisper [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=54.56s)]
*  and less choppy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=57.24s)]
*  The nature of our technology is to accelerate [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  multimedia applications for the consumer. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=62.64s)]
*  In the years since, the company's chips have become [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=65.08s)]
*  an indispensable part of many other products, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=67.72s)]
*  from PCs to cars to robots. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=70.64s)]
*  Nvidia made a pivotal decision in 2006, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  when it started allowing software developers [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  to play with its GPUs. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=79.04s)]
*  If you want to be a trillion-dollar company, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=80.64s)]
*  you can't do just one thing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=83.76s)]
*  It's kind of like opening a door. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=85.24s)]
*  And once they opened that door, people started to tinker. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=87.24s)]
*  One of those expansions was cryptocurrency mining. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=90.56s)]
*  The company's GPUs could handle the large amount [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  of computational power the task required. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=96.6s)]
*  Business flourished. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  Rising sales from the crypto rush helped Nvidia [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=101.44s)]
*  pass rival Intel in market value in 2020. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=104.56s)]
*  But sales fell as crypto crashed [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=108.16s)]
*  and the gaming industry slumped. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=110.32s)]
*  Still, the chipmaker was starting to see [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=112.08s)]
*  another frontier boom, generative AI. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  In May, sales of chips for the data centers [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=118.0s)]
*  needed to power AI were up by 14%, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=120.72s)]
*  thanks in large part to the growing need [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=124.16s)]
*  for Nvidia chips in AI calculations. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=126.04s)]
*  For Nvidia, that was a decade in the making. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=129.32s)]
*  The company's chips broke through in the AI community [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=132.48s)]
*  in 2012 with a neural network called AlexNet. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=135.44s)]
*  We saw early on, about a decade or so ago, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=139.2s)]
*  that this way of doing software could change everything. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=142.64s)]
*  It was very futuristic. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  It was very uncertain at that point. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=146.92s)]
*  Nobody knew how big AI was gonna be. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=148.84s)]
*  They made that big bet at a time when a lot [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=151.44s)]
*  of other competitors were not making that kind of bet. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=153.76s)]
*  We risk everything to pursue deep learning. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  Nvidia chips are suited for powering AI [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=160.2s)]
*  because of their ability to do lots [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  of complex computations simultaneously. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=164.68s)]
*  Traditional processing units can't do that as quickly. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=167.32s)]
*  And other GPUs, like those from Intel and AMD, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=170.8s)]
*  haven't gained major market share in AI computing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=174.8s)]
*  If you think about how graphics work, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=177.8s)]
*  your monitor, your computer monitor, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=180.56s)]
*  has a lot of pixels, thousands of pixels on it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  And your computer needs to calculate at any given time [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  what each of those pixels need to look like. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=189.16000000000003s)]
*  It was discovered fairly quickly after Nvidia [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=191.52s)]
*  kind of opened up the door for people [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=194.52s)]
*  to use its chips for other things, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=196.24s)]
*  that they were actually really good [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=198.12s)]
*  at the kind of mathematics [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=200.24s)]
*  that underpins artificial intelligence. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=202.4s)]
*  In late 2022, AI exploded with the public release [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=204.84s)]
*  of OpenAI's chat GPT, and Nvidia's stock skyrocketed. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=209.4s)]
*  While companies like Google, Microsoft, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=214.68s)]
*  and Amazon battle it out in the AI race, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  Nvidia is raking in the cash. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=220.4s)]
*  That's because its chips power most of them. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=223.12s)]
*  For Nvidia, it's a bonanza. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=226.16s)]
*  All of these folks who are competing [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=227.64s)]
*  to get a slice of the generative AI pie need Nvidia. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=229.64s)]
*  In 2018, the division that focuses on AI computation [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=235.04s)]
*  made up less than half of the company's sales. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=239.0s)]
*  By 2022, it was the majority. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  It went from Wall Street expectation of 7 billion [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=244.48s)]
*  to Nvidia saying, actually gonna make 11 billion. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  And so that really opened people's eyes. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=249.2s)]
*  It was a real statement that this generative AI craze [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=250.92s)]
*  that everybody's talking about [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  is more than just a hype cycle. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=256.88s)]
*  But that success is creating a different problem [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=259.0s)]
*  for the company, supply. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=261.64s)]
*  The demand is literally from every corner of the world. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=263.28s)]
*  GFUs are, at this point, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=267.92s)]
*  considerably harder to get than drugs. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=270.88s)]
*  The company's supply chain hasn't been able to keep pace. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=274.28s)]
*  The chip manufacturing cycle is such [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=278.0s)]
*  that you can't just immediately make more of these things [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=279.96s)]
*  like today, if you want them. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  The company says it has filled out some of its supply. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  We are working on both supply today for this quarter, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  but we have also procured a substantial amount of supply [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=292.0s)]
*  for the second half. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=295.76000000000005s)]
*  But the chip's global demand has also caught the company [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=297.16s)]
*  in the crosshairs of increasing tensions [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=300.16s)]
*  between the US and China. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=302.24s)]
*  Last year, the company said $400 million [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=304.16s)]
*  of its quarterly sales could be subject [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=307.40000000000003s)]
*  to new US chip licensing requirements for China. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=310.04s)]
*  In response, NVIDIA began offering an alternative chip [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=313.24s)]
*  to customers in China. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=316.32s)]
*  Despite some roadblocks, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=317.88s)]
*  the chip industry has its eyes on NVIDIA's success. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=319.72s)]
*  They're still riding this boom. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  It's nowhere near done. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=324.44s)]
*  The real question is whether companies can build [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  huge, huge businesses that are based [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  on that artificial intelligence capability. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPID_b1k_cw&t=332.48s)]
