# How to Make Sense of Coronavirus Data | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 09, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA)
*  This line tells a story. The story changes depending on whether the line climbs up, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=0.0s)]
*  plateaus, or the line goes down. What do the lines created by COVID-19 data tell us? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=6.88s)]
*  The best thing to do is look at the local data because things are varying quite a bit, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=14.0s)]
*  not only country to country, but state to state. And even within different counties, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=19.04s)]
*  there is rapidly different spread depending on what's going on in your community. So it's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=23.36s)]
*  helpful to look at different things together, including cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=27.8s)]
*  A lot of these metrics vary based on who's reporting it, and they're reporting them in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=33.56s)]
*  slightly different ways. The number of confirmed cases is likely lower than the number of actual [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=37.56s)]
*  cases because not everyone has been tested. And a lot of the milder asymptomatic cases were likely [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=42.52s)]
*  missed, especially earlier on in the pandemic. States have different ways of keeping track of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=48.2s)]
*  how many people are in the hospital being treated for COVID-19. Some states don't report this, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=54.44s)]
*  and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn't require it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=60.44s)]
*  You'll have people reporting the number of people currently hospitalized for COVID, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=65.56s)]
*  the total number over time, who's in the intensive care unit, and then some states also give you age [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=69.88s)]
*  and underlying health condition data and other demographics such as race and ethnicity, though [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=75.64s)]
*  that's not uniform across everywhere. So the hospitalization data that you're going to find [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=80.44s)]
*  depends a lot on where you are. States and counties also have slightly different methods [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  for counting deaths, but it's one of the more solid data points that we have to actually figure [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=89.48s)]
*  out how far and how severely the disease is spread. But like the number of confirmed cases, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=93.88s)]
*  the number of COVID deaths is also likely higher, especially since we didn't test a lot of people [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=99.0s)]
*  sort of in the beginning of the pandemic. Some states are going back and counting deaths [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=103.88s)]
*  presumed to be from COVID-19. That may skew the trend. Sometimes what you'll see is a spike in [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=109.56s)]
*  deaths in some states. That recently happened in New Jersey when there was a spike, but actually [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=116.92s)]
*  they just went back and added a lot of their presumed deaths to their total death count. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=122.28s)]
*  There is a metric lag between the data points, confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=127.88s)]
*  First, as people start to show symptoms and get tested, you'll likely see cases followed a week [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=135.0s)]
*  or so by hospitalizations. And then deaths usually lag behind those because usually with this disease, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=140.36s)]
*  people are sick for a few weeks before they die. Public health authorities also track the positivity [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=147.08s)]
*  rate that compares the number of tests that come back positive with the total number of COVID-19 [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=153.48s)]
*  tests. So if positivity rate is high, that likely means that all of the cases in the area aren't [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=159.96s)]
*  necessarily being caught. But if the positivity rate is low, most of the cases are likely being [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=166.28s)]
*  captured and you're probably doing enough testing to capture all of the cases. But keeping track of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  how the positivity rate is changing now that there is wider spread testing is important. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=176.84s)]
*  Because if the positivity rate is going up over time in a specific area, that likely means that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  there are more cases being found and the disease is spreading. Sometimes there are spikes or [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=187.0s)]
*  adds or different patterns. Like for instance, case and death reporting usually slows down on [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=192.44s)]
*  the weekends. And so it's important to look at averages, whether or not it's over five days or [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=197.48s)]
*  seven days to sort of smooth out all of those lags and look at the trends over time. Because [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=203.72s)]
*  looking at just one day or just the last couple of days likely isn't going to give you a clear picture. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=208.84s)]
*  you [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPAabBdDyhA&t=217.0s)]
