# Japan Airlines Crash How All 379 Onboard Survived  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A)
*  All 379 passengers and crew on board a Japan Airlines jet managed to escape after a collision [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=0.0s)]
*  on a runway at Haneda Airport in Tokyo on Tuesday. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  The passenger plane was engulfed in flames soon after crashing with a coastguard plane. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=12.6s)]
*  Five of the six crew members on the smaller jet died. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  But the nearly full Airbus A350 jet managed to evacuate safely in under 20 minutes. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=22.52s)]
*  There were lots of things about that aircraft that helped to protect the passengers. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=28.8s)]
*  Here are some of the factors that led to this successful evacuation. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=33.28s)]
*  At 5.47pm on Tuesday, Japan Airlines Flight 516, an Airbus A350-900 travelling from Sapporo [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=38.04s)]
*  in northern Japan to Tokyo, collided with a coastguard plane. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  JL516 was burning on the outside. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=51.56s)]
*  But crucially, it was not yet burning on the inside. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=57.080000000000005s)]
*  And so the race to save its passengers started. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=60.84s)]
*  The way an evacuation usually proceeds is that once the plane has come to a standstill, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  the flight crew usually give the command to the cabin crew to initiate the evacuation. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=71.80000000000001s)]
*  And the flight deck will normally tell the cabin crew which side or which exits they can use. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=78.92s)]
*  Japan Airlines said it took some time to get the doors open [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=85.72s)]
*  because flight attendants first needed the pilot's confirmation [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  that the airplane had come to a complete stop [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=92.52s)]
*  and they needed to check whether it was safe to evacuate. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=95.12s)]
*  To operate around the world, aircraft manufacturers must prove to regulators [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=98.92s)]
*  that passengers can evacuate a plane in 90 seconds using only half of the exits. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=103.56s)]
*  They conduct tests under conditions meant to simulate real life, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=109.76s)]
*  but experts say the tests often fall short of replicating real accident conditions. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=113.48s)]
*  It's only when you have a real accident like this that you get to see exactly how that works. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  For the A350, there are four pairs of exits, so there are eight exits on the aircraft. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=123.2s)]
*  So the certification test would have been done with four exits. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=129.0s)]
*  Now in the A350 accident at Hanada, we didn't have four exits, we had three exits. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=133.52s)]
*  And we had two exits in the front, so you're going to have lots of people trying to use that front exit. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=139.48000000000002s)]
*  This is a sub-optimal evacuation situation. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=143.8s)]
*  Experts say the Japan Airlines crew did an impressive job to evacuate under difficult conditions. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=148.44s)]
*  Flight attendants asked people to leave their belongings behind [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=154.68s)]
*  and remove any sharp heels that might tear the evacuation chutes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for your visit. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  Welcome on board. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=166.56s)]
*  When you've got your big roller bag or your big rucksack or whatever, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=168.24s)]
*  and you're going down the aisle, you're taking up much more space than a single person would. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  And so that's making the congestion worse. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=177.0s)]
*  And finally, if you manage to get to the exit with the bag, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  and you take the big luggage down the chute, that can damage the slide. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=183.24s)]
*  By 6.05pm, 18 minutes after the collision, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=189.4s)]
*  the evacuation was complete and everyone on JL516 was safe. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  Experts say the design of the Airbus A350 was also key. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=199.84s)]
*  More than half of the aircraft was built from carbon fibre reinforced plastic, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=204.44000000000003s)]
*  rather than aluminium like older planes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=209.88000000000002s)]
*  The Airbus A350 is the newest Airbus aircraft. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=212.72000000000003s)]
*  It uses a composite fuselage, as does the Boeing 787. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=216.68s)]
*  What we've seen here is the first serious event involving an A350. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  We know that that aircraft met the design standards in terms of strength, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=225.32s)]
*  in terms of how it might deal with a fire. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=229.08s)]
*  When you look at the fire, the aircraft seems to have done exactly what you want it to do, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=231.44s)]
*  which was protect the occupants for long enough that they could evacuate from the aircraft. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=235.24s)]
*  Airbus said tests show that carbon fibre composites may contain fire longer than an aluminium fuselage. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  As it heats up, the aluminium loses its strength [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  and you could get the aircraft breaking on the tarmac, breaking its back. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=250.0s)]
*  Now, with the composite fibre, it retains its strength for longer as it's being heated. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=253.12s)]
*  Every second counts. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=259.08s)]
*  Every second can make the difference between life and death. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=261.84s)]
*  A Japanese Transport Ministry official said it was too soon to determine the cause of the collision, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=268.0s)]
*  but a formal investigation would be conducted. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=273.64000000000004s)]
*  Airbus said it was sending a team of specialists to help the Japanese investigators. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=276.64000000000004s)]
*  The accident marks the first total loss of an Airbus A350 since its first flight in 2013. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=282.12s)]
*  The A350 is becoming one of the most popular jets for airlines around the world. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=289.16s)]
*  Experts say there are important lessons to learn from the Haneda crash. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=295.76000000000005s)]
*  For anybody flying, it's an incredibly safe method of transport. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  But when things go wrong, there's a whole bunch of people who are working to try and keep us safe. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=305.12s)]
*  So, you know, when you get on the aircraft and you feel grumpy with the flight attendant [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  that you don't get your drink quickly enough, just remember that this is a safety professional. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=314.8s)]
*  And then that incredible evacuation, these were the last people off the aircraft. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnWbNf6s0A&t=319.04s)]
