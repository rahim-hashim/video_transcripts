# Why Some See Web 3.0 as the Future of the Internet  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA)
*  Web3 is the newest buzzword taking over the tech and venture capital world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=0.0s)]
*  And if you found yourself wondering what it means, you're not alone. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=5.32s)]
*  Web3 is seen as the third generation of the internet, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  a decentralized online ecosystem based on the blockchain. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=12.84s)]
*  Web3 represents kind of a new philosophy [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  about how to realize these technologies in a more distributed and democratic way. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=19.56s)]
*  Venture capitalists have invested billions into this vision, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=23.52s)]
*  but some tech experts are unconvinced that Web3 could scale globally. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  Skeptics like Tesla CEO Elon Musk have called it a marketing buzzword. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=31.6s)]
*  A lot of the skepticism about Web3.0 comes from the fact that its early expressions are fairly primitive. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  As experts debate whether or not this new version of the web can become a reality, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=44.72s)]
*  here are some of the underlying principles behind the vision for Web3.0. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=50.64s)]
*  To better understand Web3.0 and what sets it apart from the web we use today, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=56.48s)]
*  you have to go back to the early days of the internet, what experts now refer to as Web1.0. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=61.68s)]
*  Most of the participants were content consumers [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=68.08s)]
*  who were limited to navigating through individual static webpages. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=70.88s)]
*  Web1.0 for those who remember was just raw HTML and lots of very simple webpages. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=74.8s)]
*  And it wasn't really controlled by anybody. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=82.68s)]
*  This was a more decentralized version of the web, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=84.6s)]
*  meaning anyone who knew how to code could build on it from their own computers. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=87.72s)]
*  But at this time only a small number of users had the technical skills to create and publish content. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  Then came Web2.0, which is the stage of the internet we're living through now. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=98.52s)]
*  Web technologies like JavaScript and HTML5 made the internet more interactive, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=103.96s)]
*  allowing startups to build platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and many others. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=109.56s)]
*  For the first time, anyone could publish content online, even if they couldn't code. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=114.91999999999999s)]
*  Web2.0 is this modern centralized version of the web. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=119.72s)]
*  We're all sharing things on social media which are owned by only two or three companies, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  and we're all using Google search. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=129.16s)]
*  These companies own and manage the data collected from their users. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=131.48s)]
*  And they frequently track and save this data and use it for targeted ads. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=135.0s)]
*  What's at the core of their business model is data. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=140.92s)]
*  Olga Mack is a blockchain lecturer at UC Berkeley [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=144.28s)]
*  and is optimistic about Web3's potential to reshape the internet. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=147.48s)]
*  The data economy where the user generated content, whether it's a conversation or a video, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=152.12s)]
*  that is exchanged for services. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=159.48s)]
*  And so there is a perception that this monopoly of data could be abused. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=161.4s)]
*  Here's where the vision for Web3.0 comes in. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=167.72s)]
*  The term Web3.0 was first coined by one of the creators of the Ethereum blockchain, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=170.52s)]
*  Gavin Wood. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=175.88000000000002s)]
*  In a 2014 blog post, Wood envisioned Web3.0 as an open and decentralized version of the internet. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  Theoretically, users would be able to exchange money and information on the web [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  without the need for a middleman like a bank or a tech company. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=189.4s)]
*  In this vision for a Web3.0 world, people would have more control over their data [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=193.16000000000003s)]
*  and be able to sell it if they choose. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=197.96s)]
*  It would all be operated on a decentralized distributed ledger technology. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=200.52s)]
*  The most common version of this is known as the blockchain. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=205.0s)]
*  While still considered relatively new and unproven, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=208.36s)]
*  it could offer more transparency and autonomy for users. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=211.32000000000002s)]
*  The computers that are actually doing that computing for you or storing that data, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  anyone could own those computers. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=221.24s)]
*  Anyone can become a part of that blockchain. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=222.68s)]
*  And so it's not Facebook and Google's computers doing that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=225.16000000000003s)]
*  With a single personalized account, users would theoretically be able to move seamlessly [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=228.84s)]
*  from social media to email to shopping, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=234.28s)]
*  creating a public record on the blockchain of all that activity. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=237.0s)]
*  But how exactly would Web3.0 remain operational [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  if it's not controlled by a central corporation or entity? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  Theoretically, people would be given virtual tokens or cryptocurrencies [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=249.0s)]
*  to incentivize them to participate in the operation of Web3.0. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=254.36s)]
*  A central element of this system is so-called DeFi or decentralized finance. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=258.84s)]
*  And the idea is that if you can issue a token for everything in the universe, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  if you can financialize every possible interaction of computers and software and humans, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=269.32s)]
*  then you can create this vast ecosystem of cryptocurrencies, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=275.0s)]
*  which can be traded, which can be valued relative to one another. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=278.67999999999995s)]
*  Still, it's unclear how this decentralized token system would be regulated, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=282.52s)]
*  how it could operate on a large scale, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=287.56s)]
*  or even how well it would distribute control of the internet. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=289.64s)]
*  Critics of the idea, like Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=293.72s)]
*  called Web3 a centralized entity with a different label. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=297.08s)]
*  Developers who really dug into this think that the underlying blockchain structures of Web3.0 are [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=301.48s)]
*  very insecure, not decentralized as promised. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=308.92s)]
*  They're actually as centralized as the previous technologies. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=312.28s)]
*  Some see Web3.0 as a critical building block in creating the metaverse, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=316.6s)]
*  an immersive online world where people can use avatars to socialize, shop, work, and play. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=321.64000000000004s)]
*  But others say Web3 and the metaverse are two very different concepts. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=328.20000000000005s)]
*  Because the metaverse is being hyped a lot right now and Web3 is, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=333.0s)]
*  there are some companies at the intersection of the two, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=336.52000000000004s)]
*  like let's create a metaverse that somehow is connected to the blockchain. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=338.92s)]
*  Right now, Web3 is still very much an abstract concept with little real-world foundation. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=343.32s)]
*  Skeptics like engineer and blogger Stephen Deal argue that Web3.0 [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=350.59999999999997s)]
*  doesn't have the computing power, bandwidth, or storage to work on any practical level. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=355.0s)]
*  For skeptics of Web3, their argument is that tokens and cryptocurrencies in general are just a [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=361.15999999999997s)]
*  giant bubble and as soon as it pops, in their view, all of this nonsense about how that's [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=368.04s)]
*  going to build the next internet will go away. While it remains to be seen whether or not Web3.0 [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=373.8s)]
*  will become a reality, the philosophy behind it is driving billions in investments in the venture [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=380.12s)]
*  capital world, funding a vast ecosystem of decentralized internet services. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=385.48s)]
*  So there's so much real-world money going into building Web3.0 startups that even if, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=391.08000000000004s)]
*  as a concept, it proves unworkable, we're going to be hearing about it for a long time yet to come. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEJGQD1OuKA&t=397.8s)]
