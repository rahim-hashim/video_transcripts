Video Description: The Federal Reserve’s interest rate continues to climb, reaching nearly 4% in November. But the average savings account’s interest rate is just 0.16%. Here’s how banks determine that rate — and which accounts are paying closer to the Fed’s.

# Why Your Bank’s Savings Rate Isn’t Increasing With the Fed’s  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4)
*  The Federal Reserve keeps raising interest rates to fight inflation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=0.0s)]
*  Today, it's at nearly 4%. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  And we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=5.96s)]
*  But what about the interest rates that make you money, like on your savings account? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=10.68s)]
*  Right now, the average savings account pays less than a quarter of a percent. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=15.36s)]
*  But some savings accounts are going up just as fast as the feds. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=20.12s)]
*  A lot of what you're experienced with, what's happened with savings rates, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=24.04s)]
*  really depends on where you're looking. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=26.88s)]
*  Here's why most savings accounts are lagging behind the feds' rising rates, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=28.68s)]
*  and which ones aren't. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  Let's start with why a bank pays you interest in the first place. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=35.04s)]
*  It's because, well, they need your money. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=38.64s)]
*  Banks use the deposits people keep with them to fund loans, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=41.16s)]
*  like for cars or credit cards, and they profit off of that interest. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=44.44s)]
*  Basically, they need these deposits in order to make money, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=49.04s)]
*  which is why they entice you with savings rates. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  The savings rate that a particular bank is paying is a reflection of their desire [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=55.72s)]
*  for additional deposits or their attempt to retain the deposits that they have. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=60.32s)]
*  That's it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=65.28s)]
*  Greg McBride works at Bankrate, which compiles this data on savings accounts. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=66.32s)]
*  We survey financial institutions for rate and fee information [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=70.88s)]
*  on a wide range of consumer banking products. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=74.52s)]
*  And there is a wide range, all in competition to keep your money. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=77.4s)]
*  A traditional savings account with your regular bank isn't the only safe place. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=81.52s)]
*  There's also online savings accounts, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=86.11999999999999s)]
*  which traditionally pay more interest than your local brick and mortar bank. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  Then there's CDs or certificates of deposits. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  Basically, the bank will pay more in interest, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  but only if you keep that money with them for a set amount of time. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=97.52s)]
*  It's similar to a government-treasury bond. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=101.44s)]
*  You earn more interest, but your money is tied up, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=103.92s)]
*  not readily accessible like these savings accounts. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=106.64s)]
*  But with all these choices, if the rate rises on one, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=110.12s)]
*  it usually pressures the others to rise too. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=113.68s)]
*  Usually. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  If banks want to retain deposits, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  they've got to keep pace with what government bonds are yielding. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=119.84s)]
*  Otherwise, savers will take their money out of the bank and put it in government bonds. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  Those government bonds are yielding high interest rates, though. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=127.68s)]
*  They are keeping up with the Fed's rising rates. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=130.96s)]
*  So why aren't these savings accounts? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=133.68s)]
*  The answer lies in this chart. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=136.16s)]
*  The amount of money currently held as deposits at banks. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=137.92s)]
*  You can see this huge spike here in 2020, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=141.96s)]
*  where people stopped spending, started saving, and received stimulus checks. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=144.92s)]
*  The banks were flush with deposits. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=149.32s)]
*  And they still are. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=151.72s)]
*  Experts like Greg say not only do big banks not need to attract deposits, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=153.32s)]
*  but also see rising rates as an opportunity. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=157.6s)]
*  Well, interest rates were at record lows for years. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=160.48s)]
*  And so what happened was that squeezed bank interest margins. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=163.24s)]
*  Banks don't want to pay more in interest than they're bringing in, right? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=167.04s)]
*  For a long time, even before the pandemic, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=170.64s)]
*  the Fed's kept interest rates low, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=173.2s)]
*  meaning the rate they profited from, like car loans, was also low. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=175.12s)]
*  Now that the Fed's rate is going up, meaning these rates are too, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  they're not going to increase the savings rate unless they really have to. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  And overall, banks have so many deposits right now, they don't. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=187.12s)]
*  A lot of the bigger banks in particular, they're sitting on a mountain of deposits. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  They have more deposits than they know what to do with. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=195.48s)]
*  So the last thing they're going to do is raise the cost of that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=197.28s)]
*  So who is paying a competitive rate? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=201.6s)]
*  Online accounts, often called high-yield savings accounts, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=204.56s)]
*  are offering savings rates as high as 3.5%. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=207.68s)]
*  Banks that are eager for deposits, that have a growing loan operation, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=211.92s)]
*  and need to feed that machine by bringing in more deposits, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=216.28s)]
*  they will pay increasingly competitive rates. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=220.04s)]
*  These types of accounts are still FDIC-protected like any bank. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=223.4s)]
*  You just have to transfer money in and out of them online, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=227.36s)]
*  which could take a few days, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=230.52s)]
*  as opposed to being able to make a same-day withdrawal in person. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  If you're not taking any risk, would you rather earn 3.5% [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=235.44000000000003s)]
*  or would you rather earn 0.01%? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=239.36s)]
*  I mean, that's a slam dunk. That's easy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=242.60000000000002s)]
*  So why isn't your savings account going up with the Fed's rising rates? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  It could be because you have your money in the wrong place. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5We4OY_tHV4&t=248.64000000000001s)]
