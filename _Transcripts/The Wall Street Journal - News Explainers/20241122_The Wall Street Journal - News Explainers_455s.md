Video Description: President-elect Donald Trump has a long list of policy objectives that he wants to implement quickly including border policy for immigration, closing the Department of Education, implementing tariffs and more. For most of Trump’s objectives for his second term, there are limitations including checks and balances within the process or limitations directly from Congress.

WSJ explains which of these plans he can carry out on his own, which he’ll need help from Congress for, and what might end up in the courts.

# What Trump Can and Can’t Do on Day One  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY)
*  President-elect Donald Trump has promised to do a lot in his second term. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=0.0s)]
*  Starting on day one, we will end inflation. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=3.68s)]
*  We have to do the tariffs. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=6.08s)]
*  The largest deportation operation in the history of our country. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=7.44s)]
*  But not all of Trump's policy goals are doable by the president alone. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=12.48s)]
*  Some are, like... [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=16.88s)]
*  It will be my great honor to pardon the peaceful January 6 protesters. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=18.16s)]
*  But some are not. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  We will have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=25.92s)]
*  And no tax on Social Security benefits for our seniors. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=30.16s)]
*  Here's what Trump can and can't do as president in his second term. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=34.32s)]
*  Let's start with Trump's biggest plan, immigration. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=38.56s)]
*  On day one of my administration, I will terminate every open border policy [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=41.36s)]
*  of the Biden administration. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=45.84s)]
*  And we will begin the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=47.36s)]
*  Any presidential administration can do a significant number of things [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  with regards to how people are processed at the border. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=57.92s)]
*  That doesn't mean that the president can unilaterally override current laws. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  And those laws require that the United States, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=66.64s)]
*  when presented with certain claims by migrants at the border or inside the United States, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=70.8s)]
*  they have to be heard in a certain way with a certain type of process. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=76.48s)]
*  Trump hasn't outlined a plan yet, but the president controls immigration enforcement [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=80.72s)]
*  and can decide who they prioritize to deport. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=84.64s)]
*  So Trump can change the current policy of prioritizing unauthorized people [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=87.44s)]
*  who pose a threat to anyone in the country unlawfully. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=91.44s)]
*  That still doesn't mean that 11 million people can be removed. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=95.28s)]
*  The Obama administration accomplished the highest number of internal removals. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=99.6s)]
*  And that was with the enforcement apparatus of the United States going at full bore. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=104.96s)]
*  So you can imagine the number of resources that need to be committed as a practical matter [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=110.32s)]
*  to something that even approximates the millions that the Trump administration is talking about. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=116.24s)]
*  To hire more people, to build detention centers, to pay for transportation, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=122.72s)]
*  all the logistics of increased deportations would require congressional appropriation. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=126.96s)]
*  He could ask local law enforcement to assist, although only if they volunteer [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  and if state law even allows. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=136.0s)]
*  And then local departments would have to use their own budget and resources. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=137.92s)]
*  Trump has also floated the idea of using the military. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=141.76s)]
*  The United States military is forbidden by statute from engaging in domestic law enforcement. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=145.04s)]
*  And there's not really any good way for presidents to get around that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=150.88s)]
*  So the president can say there's a national emergency and it doesn't matter. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  It doesn't change the fact that you can't use federal troops to enforce law. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=158.0s)]
*  But as commander in chief, Trump can organize the top of the military, like generals. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  And we have a military that's not woke. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=167.2s)]
*  And we have a military that's not woke. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=169.04s)]
*  You may have a few people on the top that are woke and we're going to get rid of them so damn fast [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  your head's going to stop. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=174.72s)]
*  The president can get rid of generals. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=176.0s)]
*  The president's a little more tied on replacing them. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  So Congress has a say in who replaces those generals. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=181.04s)]
*  We're going to take the Department of Education, close it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=186.64s)]
*  I'm going to close it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  The Department of Education was created by Congress and it can only be closed by Congress. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=190.88s)]
*  It mainly handles student loans and enforces civil rights programs like Title IX, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=195.84s)]
*  which protects students from gender discrimination. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=200.48s)]
*  I will keep men out of women's sports. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=203.04s)]
*  The president has the authority and the secretary of education [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=206.16s)]
*  has the authority to rewrite the Title IX regulations. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=209.68s)]
*  The Trump administration rewrote the Title IX regulations. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  The Biden administration rewrote them again. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=216.0s)]
*  And so I expect we are going to see new Title IX regulations within his first year. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=218.4s)]
*  The department allocates money to schools through these civil rights programs, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=223.68s)]
*  like for students with disabilities, and doesn't actually set curriculum. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=227.44s)]
*  I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=231.84s)]
*  transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto our children. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=238.72s)]
*  The reason that the department can cut off federal funding are well defined by law. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=247.12s)]
*  To tie new policy priorities to federal funding, you would have to pass new legislation. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=253.12s)]
*  It's important to underscore that if they were to do that, it would represent a very significant [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=260.8s)]
*  deviation from a long-held principle that the federal government should not have a say over curriculum. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=267.52s)]
*  Starting on day one, I will approve new drilling, new pipelines, new refineries, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=275.28s)]
*  new power plants, new reactors, and we will slash the red tape. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=279.68s)]
*  All he can do is tell the EPA to reconsider those rules, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  and then it will go through what's likely to be a multi-year process. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=289.44s)]
*  For example, in his first term, Trump directed the EPA to revise or withdraw the Clean Power Plan. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=293.68s)]
*  It wasn't repealed for more than two years. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=298.88s)]
*  We will drill, baby drill, and I'm going to cut your energy prices in half within [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=301.2s)]
*  12 months. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=308.64s)]
*  Trump does have the authority to direct departments like the Interior to allow for more drilling, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=310.32s)]
*  but not only do those plans have to go through the same long process, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  it's a private industry that drills and sets the price of oil. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=319.2s)]
*  And of course, even if he approves it, that doesn't mean industry is going to think it's, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=322.88s)]
*  you know, economically viable for them. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=326.8s)]
*  I can make anybody do anything through the use of tariffs. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=331.76s)]
*  And the president has the right to impose. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=335.2s)]
*  The Constitution gives the power of setting tariffs to Congress, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=338.48s)]
*  but in the 70s, they gave power to the president to set tariffs for specific retaliatory or emergency reasons. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=341.68s)]
*  It was never probably contemplated to be against the entire country, but it could be. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=348.72s)]
*  Trump wants to put tariffs on China and Mexico. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=354.16s)]
*  Every damn thing that they sell into the United States is going to have like a 25% [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=357.04s)]
*  tariff until they stop drugs from coming in. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=361.36s)]
*  As a retaliatory move, he has that authority delegated to him by the Congress. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=364.88s)]
*  But this trade lawyer thinks some of Trump's broader proposals to put blanket tariffs on [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=370.4s)]
*  every import from every country. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=374.8s)]
*  I'm going to oppose a tariff on the outside world. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  A small 10% tariff on foreign-made products will allow massive tax cuts for working families. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=380.24s)]
*  We'd see some legal challenges. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=386.96s)]
*  If he doesn't explain it, he doesn't declare an emergency. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  He just says, well, I'd like to see tariffs today of 20% on all countries, all goods. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=391.6s)]
*  I think the court would still would say, no, under the Constitution, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=398.24s)]
*  that is in fact given to the Congress of the United States. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=403.12s)]
*  You can't do it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  For most of Trump's objectives for a second term, there are limitations. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=408.16s)]
*  Checks and balances within the process or directly from Congress. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=411.92s)]
*  But most experts believe he'll follow a similar playbook as his first term. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=416.0s)]
*  Implement the policy first and have the courts decide the legality of it later. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=420.16s)]
*  And yeah, just go ahead and do things and not worry much about whether they're legal. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  I think the bet that the Trump administration is making is that eventually [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=428.72s)]
*  their views will be vindicated by perhaps a Supreme Court that is friendly to their views. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=434.0s)]
*  The attempted efforts by Trump to promote his policy agenda through the power of the executive [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=440.16s)]
*  I think remains to be seen. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsvtOKswvY&t=446.08000000000004s)]
