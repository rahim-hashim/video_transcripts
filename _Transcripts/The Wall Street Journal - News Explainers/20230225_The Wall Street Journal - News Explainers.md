# How Arming Ukraine Exposed Cracks in the U.S. Defense Supply Chain  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E)
*  This is the Javelin, an American-made missile launcher that has been critical for Ukrainian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=0.0s)]
*  forces in repelling the Russians. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=7.88s)]
*  The Javelin's efficacy, especially against tanks, has made it a symbol of the resistance. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=11.08s)]
*  There's even a story about Ukrainian parents naming their children, not a joke, their newborn [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=15.76s)]
*  child Javelin or Javelina. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=20.56s)]
*  The U.S. has already committed 8,500 Javelins to Ukraine. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=23.64s)]
*  Last year, President Biden ordered an additional $653 million worth of Javelins to be sent [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=27.76s)]
*  to aid in the war effort. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=33.88s)]
*  But Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, the two primary defense contractors that make the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  Javelin, said that most of what's pledged from the U.S. is existing stocks, not new [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  production, and that doubling production wouldn't be possible until 2026. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=45.160000000000004s)]
*  There is no magic formula in the supply chain to accelerate this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=50.56s)]
*  The inability of U.S. defense contractors to quickly replenish weaponry has raised questions [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=57.08s)]
*  about the capability of America's defense industry and led some Pentagon officials to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  argue that industry consolidation has gone too far. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=67.48s)]
*  The challenges with the Javelin are a wake-up call. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=70.64s)]
*  Ukraine has shown that our approach to acquisition since the end of the Cold War has got a downside. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=74.6s)]
*  Javelin and Stinger missiles become the poster child for both the effects of consolidation [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=83.24s)]
*  and indeed the effects of supply chain problems. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=88.08s)]
*  In 2021, the U.S. spent roughly $800 billion on its defense. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=90.96s)]
*  That's more than China, India, the United Kingdom, Russia, France, Germany, Saudi Arabia, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=97.16s)]
*  Japan and South Korea combined. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=103.44s)]
*  Given the astonishing amount America spends on its defense industry, why can't the U.S. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=106.72s)]
*  arm the Ukrainians faster? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=111.8s)]
*  The answer lies partially in how America procures its weapons. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=114.0s)]
*  This graph charts the consolidation that's taken place within the defense sector. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=119.08s)]
*  In the early 1990s, the U.S. relied on 51 primary contractors. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=122.72s)]
*  Today, that number is just five. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=127.44s)]
*  Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=129.8s)]
*  The fundamental reason that defense companies decided to consolidate after the Cold War [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=134.28s)]
*  was that the department told them to do so. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=139.64s)]
*  The department was going to be downsizing in terms of troops and equipment. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=141.6s)]
*  So therefore, there was a need for them to merge to address that declining market. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=145.56s)]
*  There was not a major competition with a great power the way the U.S. had faced with the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=151.8s)]
*  Soviet Union. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=156.56s)]
*  So in that sense, if we take shipbuilding, for example, there was less of a need to build [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  major ships. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  This trend of consolidation took place throughout the industry. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=164.76s)]
*  Tactical missile suppliers declined from 13 to 3. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=167.8s)]
*  Six-to-wing aircraft suppliers declined from 8 to 3. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=171.16s)]
*  Satellite suppliers have halved from 8 to 4. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  And builders of surface ships has dropped from 8 to 2. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=177.52s)]
*  The market in the defense industrial base is very different from the commercial marketplace. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=180.92s)]
*  The difference is that the government is both the customer and the regulator. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=185.4s)]
*  But it's much harder than a commercial marketplace where you have a virtually unlimited market. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=190.6s)]
*  According to a 2022 DOD report, consolidation has left the U.S. reliant on a small number [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  of contractors, which has stifled innovation and undermined price competition. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=202.39999999999998s)]
*  A lot of contracts, maybe as many as 40 percent of DOD contracts are in fact sole source. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  That's either because there isn't another competitor or because the existing manufacturer [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  is just an incumbent and has such advantages because they've been doing it so long that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=217.48s)]
*  there's not really another viable competitor. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=222.2s)]
*  The Javelin is a case in point. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=227.27999999999997s)]
*  Rocket motors, which are used in Javelin missiles. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=229.27999999999997s)]
*  There's only really two producers of those motors, those engines. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=232.27999999999997s)]
*  Aerojet Rocketdyne and now a unit of Northrop Grumman. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=237.48s)]
*  It used to be five, six suppliers and now you're down to two. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=240.48s)]
*  And obviously if something goes wrong at one of them, then that puts a lot of burden on [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  the other and it just slows down the entire chain. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=248.72s)]
*  Ramping up Javelin production is also difficult because of the just-in-time supply chain. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=251.72s)]
*  Scaling up production for the Javelin is a challenge and it's a challenge because the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=259.12s)]
*  way we procure and the way we produce the Javelin. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=263.52s)]
*  There are many kind of single and sole source suppliers for a lot of these components. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=266.92s)]
*  The companies that produce these, they produce them for a specific contract need and producing [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=271.2s)]
*  more than that is not optimal from a business sense. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=277.22s)]
*  The supply chain challenges, in part because of COVID, has slowed everything down. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=280.32s)]
*  So it's actually what it's done is it's extended the time it takes on average to produce systems. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=286.0s)]
*  In some cases to two, three years. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=292.52s)]
*  A 2023 CSIS report found that the U.S. is dangerously unprepared for a major conflict [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  such as the war with China in the Taiwan Strait. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=301.84s)]
*  The reality is that in a war, according to our war games, and many that have been done [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=304.76s)]
*  within the Department of Defense, both classified and unclassified, the U.S. runs out of key [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=310.76s)]
*  munitions like long-range precision strike in less than a week of a Taiwan Strait conflict. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=316.32s)]
*  The problem is we don't have enough, not of everything, but of some very specific weapon [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=324.44s)]
*  systems that are important for the kinds of conflicts that we're likely to face with China [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=330.08s)]
*  and that are important to deter those conflicts from even happening. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=335.04s)]
*  Today, many of the defense sector supply chains were built to fight the war and terror. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=338.96s)]
*  In terms of acquisitions, the U.S. focused on components that were important to target [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=343.92s)]
*  the Islamic State or the Taliban or Al-Qaeda around the globe, some very specific weapon [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=349.16s)]
*  systems like drones, and didn't require the kinds of stockpiles of munitions that are [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=355.08s)]
*  important for a conventional war. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=360.96s)]
*  The Ukraine war was a very stark reminder that a conventional war is a war of industrial [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  bases. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=370.28s)]
*  Countries involved in a conventional war, they churned through munitions, they churned [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=371.88s)]
*  through weapon systems at a much more rapid pace than we had seen during the counterterrorism [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=378.79999999999995s)]
*  campaigns after 9-11. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=384.6s)]
*  In response to a request for comment, Raytheon wrote, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  Our industry has experienced unprecedented supply chain challenges over the past two [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=391.16s)]
*  years. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=395.08000000000004s)]
*  However, by leveraging our scale, we have been able to provide significant support to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=396.08000000000004s)]
*  our suppliers, and we're already seeing some components like chips and electronics become [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=400.36s)]
*  more readily available. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=405.0s)]
*  Which brings us back to the Javelin and a proposed merger of two contractors, Aerojet [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=410.6s)]
*  Rocketdyne, which makes Javelin motors, and L3Harris. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=415.88s)]
*  L3Harris and Aerojet, which has agreed to the deal, both argue that by combining and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=419.48s)]
*  being part of a bigger company, that Aerojet can access resources, access extra investment, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=426.08000000000004s)]
*  which will help it perhaps catch up quicker. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=432.48s)]
*  But some politicians, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, disagree. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=435.08000000000004s)]
*  In a tweet earlier this year, she took aim at the proposed $4.7 billion merger, arguing [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=438.88s)]
*  that further consolidation would undermine competitiveness within the sector. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=444.84s)]
*  It's unclear if the Aerojet Rocketdyne-L3Harris deal will go through, especially given that [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=452.48s)]
*  a year ago, the Federal Trade Commission torpedoed Lockheed Martin's attempt to purchase Aerojet [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=458.04s)]
*  Rocketdyne on antitrust grounds. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=463.04s)]
*  Lockheed accounted for just about a third of Aerojet's sales. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=465.88s)]
*  That was turned down ultimately by Federal antitrust regulators. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=469.76s)]
*  They just basically didn't trust that Lockheed would continue to make things for other people, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=473.56s)]
*  and not just for itself. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=479.48s)]
*  L3Harris is different. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=481.15999999999997s)]
*  It's a very tiny customer of Aerojet at the moment. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=482.58s)]
*  And it will be moving into areas like Missiles, where it's currently just not present. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=485.0s)]
*  So it would in theory emerge as a stronger competitor to Lockheed Martin and Northrop [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=489.44s)]
*  Grumman. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=494.4s)]
*  As war continues in Ukraine and the threat of other conflicts around the world loom, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=496.84s)]
*  policymakers must now grapple with constraints of consolidation and a supply chain built [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=501.4s)]
*  for yesterday's threat environment. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEe_dJZtF1E&t=506.68s)]
