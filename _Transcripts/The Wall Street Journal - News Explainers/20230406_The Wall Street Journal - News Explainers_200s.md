# Finland Joins NATO What This Historic Alliance Expansion Means  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY)
*  Finland is now officially a member of the world's largest military alliance. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=0.0s)]
*  This is an historic day. We welcome Finland as the newest member of our alliance. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=7.0s)]
*  The Nordic nation completed one of the fastest recession processes in NATO's history. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=14.0s)]
*  Finland applied to join in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=20.0s)]
*  In the process, Finland ended its decades-old policy of military non-alignment. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=26.0s)]
*  It will change Russia's posture towards Europe and NATO in general in the future. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=32.0s)]
*  Here's what the historic expansion means for the alliance and security in Europe. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=36.0s)]
*  First of all, Finland adds more than 800 miles to NATO's border with Russia. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=42.0s)]
*  It also extends the area in which NATO can conduct its operations. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=49.0s)]
*  The territory spans about a thousand miles from the Baltic Sea to the Arctic. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=53.0s)]
*  Finland joining NATO also means that the NATO alliance comes closer to the Kola Peninsula, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=58.0s)]
*  which has great strategic importance for Russia. It's where many of its nuclear capabilities are based. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=64.0s)]
*  And Finland doesn't come empty-handed, as it's one of Europe's best defended and best armed countries. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=69.0s)]
*  Finland has maintained a posture against Russia where it was ready for conflict. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=77.0s)]
*  It can mobilize over 800,000 troops and it's also continued to modernize its military. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=82.0s)]
*  In the past decade, it's received surface air missiles, rocket systems, and it's even received F-35s from the US. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=87.0s)]
*  The Kremlin's decision to invade Ukraine radically changed Finnish public opinion on the country's non-aligned defence doctrine. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=97.0s)]
*  In May 2022, support for NATO membership leaps to 76%, a fundamental shift from 30% in January that year, just before the invasion. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=104.0s)]
*  And for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Finland's accession is a major strategic setback. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=116.0s)]
*  There is definitely a sort of a paradox in these developments, given that we know that Vladimir Putin wants to divide NATO and the Western alliance. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=122.0s)]
*  But what he's actually facing now is a more united Western front than ever. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=131.0s)]
*  President Putin wanted to slam NATO's door shut. Today, we show the world that he failed. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=136.0s)]
*  Russia said NATO's enlargement is a threat to its security and national interests. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=145.0s)]
*  In these conditions, we are taking responsible measures. We are defending the security of the United States. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=150.0s)]
*  We are waiting to join the alliance, which needs the approval of all existing members to accept any new entrants. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=180.0s)]
*  Sweden definitely hopes to be a member of NATO by the end of the year. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=186.0s)]
*  Our persistent efforts for a rapid Swedish membership will continue. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B-6ybN_yLY&t=190.0s)]
