# The Risks and Rewards of Mobile Voting, Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k)
*  Registered voters in the Seattle area just had the chance to participate in what officials say is the country's most extensive use of mobile voting yet. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=0.0s)]
*  Over 95% of the election's ballots were submitted electronically via app or website. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=8.28s)]
*  Supporters of mobile voting say if you let people cast their ballots on their phones, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=13.52s)]
*  they're a lot more likely to do it because it'll be easier and take less time. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=17.92s)]
*  But some experts warn that voting on our phones creates new privacy and security problems that we don't have solutions for. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=21.84s)]
*  Will it always be too risky for a presidential election? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=29.479999999999997s)]
*  Or is nationwide mobile voting only a matter of time? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=32.64s)]
*  At the end of the day, voting software is still software. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  And all software is buggy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=40.56s)]
*  And there will always be errors in security holes. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=43.76s)]
*  It's impossible to build perfect software. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  A tech company called Democracy Live built the system that Washington voters used during the recent pilot. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=49.16s)]
*  And while Democracy Live agrees that both software and humans can be fallible, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=54.6s)]
*  they're confident their system is still safer than some methods currently in use. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  King County, which is Washington state's most populous county, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=63.24s)]
*  recently allowed mobile voting for over one million voters in a small local election. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=67.08s)]
*  Voters could use their phones or their laptops to log on to a portal, open up a ballot, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=73.68s)]
*  and then they could choose to submit that ballot electronically, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=79.84s)]
*  which is what we would think of as mobile voting. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=83.56s)]
*  Supporters of mobile voting say that it will make the process more convenient and boost voter turnout. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=86.0s)]
*  In King County, election officials say that turnout this year was double what it was for this election last year. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=91.28s)]
*  Most of the roughly 6,500 ballots were submitted electronically. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  Only 209 were submitted by mail or Dropbox. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  If I had to choose between submitting a paper ballot or using the app on my phone, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=104.48s)]
*  I actually would do the paper ballot. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=110.56s)]
*  We have a lot of experience with paper ballots over time. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  And so there's kind of a big field test out there that's been going on for decades. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=116.2s)]
*  And we know that it's not easy to change a large number of paper ballots. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=122.0s)]
*  My concern about the digital environment is that once those votes are collected in a single database, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=127.4s)]
*  the possibility that someone could manipulate a large number of votes at once is much higher. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  Even more importantly is the fact that other people would potentially fear that that would happen. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=140.6s)]
*  Even under the best circumstances, introducing new election technology can add a new layer of doubt to results. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=146.28s)]
*  In Iowa's caucuses, the state Democratic Party wanted to use an app to collect and report results [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=152.6s)]
*  because they thought it would make it faster and easier. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=159.56s)]
*  Unfortunately, based on our reporting, the app wasn't put through enough testing and there wasn't enough planning. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=162.76s)]
*  So it ended up having glitches that have really caused problems for figuring out what the results were in Iowa. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=170.04s)]
*  There was a sense that maybe it just didn't work the way it was supposed to work. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=176.68s)]
*  And just introducing that amount of doubt into the system delegitimizes people's confidence in the vote. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=180.64s)]
*  And it doesn't, I think, give people a high level of confidence that we can manage this sort of digital layer [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=189.8s)]
*  on top of what is already a pretty emotionally fraught voting system. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=196.52s)]
*  Advocates are worried after what happened in Iowa that people start to be scared of using new technology for voting. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  Supporters of mobile voting say they focus on security, they plan in advance, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=210.0s)]
*  and that they don't think what happened with Iowa's app should have a negative impact on their separate efforts. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=215.68s)]
*  Running an end-to-end test is crucial in most software development. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=223.84s)]
*  Creating software for smartphones presents a unique challenge when it comes to testing, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=227.72s)]
*  which is especially important when creating voting technology. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=232.12s)]
*  We're building it so that it can run on all the thousands of possible combinations of Android phones and iOS phones [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=236.52s)]
*  and even Microsoft phones and phones whose operating system haven't been updated in three or four years or even more. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=246.12s)]
*  And so there's almost a limitless number of environments in which you have to prove that software can work. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=252.88s)]
*  And it's almost impossible to test it in all those environments except in an actual election. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=259.68s)]
*  Still, mobile voting supporters say it's important to find ways to improve access and engage voters. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=266.8s)]
*  Some experts and some people who advocate for mobile voting say it's inevitable. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=273.04s)]
*  They say that younger generations are used to doing everything on their phones and they want to meet voters where they are. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=277.92s)]
*  Maybe when every single car on the road is driven by a robot and a generation of people can't even imagine [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=285.0s)]
*  that a human being would have ever driven a car, we'll also be saying, God, can you imagine that people used to vote on pieces of paper? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=292.8s)]
*  I can see that coming and I think we'll be there, but I think it's 20 years, not 10. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqMdQ6xvU_k&t=301.36s)]
