# The World Behind ‘Tiger King’: Why There Are So Many Big Cats in the U.S. | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 15, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk)
*  The Netflix documentary series Tiger King has found a captive audience stuck at home during coronavirus lockdowns [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=0.0s)]
*  There's really only one big story that everybody's talking about Tiger King Tiger King Tiger King [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=6.16s)]
*  It has to be seen to be believed and even then it's so wild the protagonist [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=11.88s)]
*  Personalities and deep-seated rivalry have become cultural touchstones making lines like this. Hey, are you cool cats and kittens? It's Carol into viral memes [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=16.0s)]
*  Tiger King elevated the bizarre culture of tiger ownership in the United States [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  But it didn't reveal how prolific this culture really is. That's because no one's really sure [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=29.740000000000002s)]
*  There are somewhere between 5,000 and 15,000 captive tigers living in the US today [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=39.5s)]
*  That's a lot more than the roughly 3,500 tigers living in the wild [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=46.22s)]
*  Their numbers have fallen for decades due to poaching and loss of habitat [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=50.46s)]
*  The vast majority of tigers living in the United States don't live in zoos. They're owned by private individuals [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=55.5s)]
*  Because of this there isn't a clear record of how many tigers there are in the United States and where exactly they're being kept [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=64.34s)]
*  According to legal experts and animal rights activists the laws meant to protect tigers actually led to their proliferation in this country [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=72.22s)]
*  Putting the animals lives in public safety at risk [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=80.1s)]
*  Most of the tigers in the US weren't rescued abroad or smuggled in they were born here [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=85.46s)]
*  There are nine subspecies of tigers [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=91.58s)]
*  Three are extinct and the remaining six are endangered [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=94.38s)]
*  Accredited zoos in the United States have breeding programs designed to sustain endangered tiger populations [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=98.7s)]
*  But those make up a small fraction of the tiger is believed to be in the US [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=105.7s)]
*  Most are bred at so-called roadside zoos [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=110.18s)]
*  It's really not a zoo. It's just a menagerie of animals [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  They offer pay-to-play experiences where you get tiger baby time where you can play on the floor with baby animals [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=118.1s)]
*  Including tigers this contact with baby tigers is called cub petting and can be big business for roadside zoos [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=125.1s)]
*  Cub petting is extremely lucrative for [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=132.9s)]
*  Exhibitors in fact one cub can yield up to a million dollars in revenue [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=136.7s)]
*  During its lifetime the US Department of Agriculture [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=141.62s)]
*  Which regulates roadside zoos allows cub petting but recommends it be limited to cubs between 8 and 12 weeks old [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=144.62s)]
*  With such a limited window for public interactions roadside zoos are compelled to keep breeding tigers [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=152.54s)]
*  Experts say that this demand for cubs has led to extensive cross breeding of tigers in the United States [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=159.38s)]
*  To the point where most are no longer genetically similar to those found in the wild [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=165.18s)]
*  The most notorious example of this is the white tiger [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=170.26000000000002s)]
*  White tigers are not a separate subspecies yet here in the United States [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=174.54000000000002s)]
*  Exhibitors love to breed them. The problem is these tigers have to be heavily inbred [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=179.70000000000002s)]
*  Along with the white coloring comes really really premature death renal failure and serious kidney problems [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=186.02s)]
*  blindness and also facial deformities as many as [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=193.42000000000002s)]
*  95% of the tigers in the United States are believed to be these so-called generic tigers and for a long time the US government [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  Didn't regulate them like other subspecies [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=204.42s)]
*  Tigers in the United States are protected by the Endangered Species Act [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=208.54s)]
*  This law prohibits the sale and transportation of endangered animals unless you get a permit from the US Fish and Wildlife Service [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=212.82s)]
*  and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=220.29999999999998s)]
*  that permit [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=221.26s)]
*  Application has to be supported by some sort of demonstration that the underlying activity [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=222.94s)]
*  Benefits the species survival in the wild in 1998 the Fish and Wildlife Service removed the permitting requirements for generic tigers [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=230.18s)]
*  Their reasoning was that these tigers lacked conservation value meaning if they didn't exist in the wild [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=239.14000000000001s)]
*  Then there was no reason to regulate their movement here in the US [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=244.66s)]
*  This created a loophole for breeders to sell off their generic tigers that were too old for cub petting and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=248.72s)]
*  You would see without fail every single month tiger cubs available [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=254.92s)]
*  For sale for a couple hundred bucks or even for free once they've passed that age where they could no longer [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=260.6s)]
*  Legally handled by the public the loophole was closed in 2016 [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=267.88s)]
*  But experts say by then thousands of tigers had made their way across the country [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=272.72s)]
*  For that loophole to exist for 18 years created an environment where enough tigers were bred as quickly as possible [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=278.88000000000005s)]
*  For many of them to fall into a black hole [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=286.48s)]
*  States vary in their restrictions of big cat ownership from outright bans to no restrictions at all [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  Which experts say leads to them falling into inexperienced hands and abusive situations? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  Private ownership advocates contend that while irresponsible big cat ownership can lead to abuse [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=302.21999999999997s)]
*  This represents a small portion of private owners and has declined as new owners have become better educated about big cats [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=307.17999999999995s)]
*  No private individual has the capability of providing a humane [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=314.17999999999995s)]
*  existence for these animals and you cannot tame an apex predator [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=319.26s)]
*  You cannot take the wild out of a tiger [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=324.65999999999997s)]
*  Dozens of exotic animals escaped from an animal reserve in Zanesville [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=328.82s)]
*  Deputies armed with assault rifles went to the animal farm where they found the owner dead animal cages open in [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=333.54s)]
*  2011 in Ohio man released dozens of his privately owned exotic animals including 18 tigers into the local community [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=340.78s)]
*  He released these animals [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=348.34s)]
*  into the community [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=350.94s)]
*  placed first responders in an absolutely no-win situation [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=352.58s)]
*  Where they were forced to? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=357.1s)]
*  Literally slaughter these animals in order to keep the community safe. So that's what the big cat public safety act would help solve [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=359.22s)]
*  The big cat public safety act is pending legislation that if enacted would ban private ownership of big cats and ban public [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=367.58000000000004s)]
*  interactions like cub petting at roadside zoos [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=375.82000000000005s)]
*  Opponents of the legislation say laws currently on the books are sufficient to protect big cats and that the problem lies with lack of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=378.70000000000005s)]
*  Enforcement they also contend that a blanket ban on private big cat ownership would create a precedent to ban other exotic pets [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=385.88s)]
*  America loves tigers because tigers are the most iconic of the big cat species. They're really representative of how we look at [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  conservation of protected animals their role is much bigger than just [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=402.8s)]
*  tigers themselves [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5Wy39e_Dk&t=408.56s)]
