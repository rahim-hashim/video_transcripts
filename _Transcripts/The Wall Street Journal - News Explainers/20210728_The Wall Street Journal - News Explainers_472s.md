# Boeing 787 Dreamliner: A Timeline of Recent Production Problems | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 28, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k)
*  Boeing's popular 787 Dreamliner is facing a new manufacturing defect, which might sound [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=0.0s)]
*  familiar. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=6.88s)]
*  This is another blow for Boeing. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=7.88s)]
*  The defect could take three weeks to address, which means airlines won't be receiving Dreamliners [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=10.24s)]
*  in time for much of the busy summer travel season. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Recent issues with the plane maker's widebody aircraft stretch back to last summer. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=19.7s)]
*  Since then, the defects have prompted regulatory review, a halting of deliveries, a pile up [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=24.32s)]
*  of more than 100 planes and are now pressuring Boeing's bottom line. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=29.099999999999998s)]
*  This is not a situation Boeing wants to be in at this point. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=33.06s)]
*  Right now, it can't deliver its most popular widebody aircraft. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=36.94s)]
*  It's almost as if a company like Apple couldn't deliver laptops. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=42.66s)]
*  So what are the issues with the Dreamliner? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  And how did Boeing get here? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  First, a bit of background. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=51.78s)]
*  The 787 Dreamliner made its commercial debut in 2011. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=54.22s)]
*  It promised all sorts of possibilities for new routes, new efficiencies for airlines, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=58.14s)]
*  a better passenger experience. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=63.86s)]
*  And then it wound up on the ground. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=65.78s)]
*  In early 2013, a fire broke out aboard an empty Dreamliner in Boston, sparked by battery [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=68.22s)]
*  problems that later surfaced on another Dreamliner in Japan. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=73.06s)]
*  In two weeks time, we saw two cases of battery failures on the 787 and the grounding of the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=77.54s)]
*  entire fleet by the FAA. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=88.06s)]
*  So the Dreamliner had to emerge from that experience and regain the confidence of airlines [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=90.34s)]
*  and the traveling public. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=96.58000000000001s)]
*  The 787 is now one of Boeing's most popular aircraft. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  More than 60 airlines, including American and United, have added 787s to their fleet. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=101.9s)]
*  The Dreamliner is unique, as it was Boeing's first plane designed largely by other companies. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=107.62s)]
*  Its primary structure is made mostly from composite materials for efficiency. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=112.66000000000001s)]
*  Because the Dreamliner's structure is new in the world of aircraft manufacturing, Boeing [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  and the FAA are learning how its composite materials and where those materials join age [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  over time. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=129.26s)]
*  So fast forward nearly a decade of flights later to August of last year, when Boeing [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=130.64s)]
*  voluntarily grounded eight Dreamliners, found with two different production defects in the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  same location. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=140.0s)]
*  For an aircraft manufacturer to do that on its own is something that you really don't [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=141.0s)]
*  see that often. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=145.92s)]
*  The defects were outlined in an August 31st Internal Federal Aviation Administration memo, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=147.0s)]
*  which was reviewed and then reported on by the Wall Street Journal. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=151.76s)]
*  We first reported about the Dreamliner issues in September when the FAA launched a high-level [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=155.36s)]
*  review of Boeing's Dreamliner manufacturing processes. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=162.72000000000003s)]
*  At that time, Boeing and the FAA were trying to get their heads around the problem, and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  they focused on one general area of the aircraft. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  Specifically, the FAA memo says they were looking at non-conforming sections of the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  rear fuselage, or body of the plane, that fell short of its own engineering standards. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=181.12s)]
*  The first defect had to do with how Boeing used shims, or the material that fills the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=186.32s)]
*  gaps between sections of the fuselage. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=190.32s)]
*  The second stemmed from variations in the smoothness of the fuselage skin. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=193.16s)]
*  While the two types of defects, independent of each other, didn't pose an immediate safety [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  risk, together in the same section were deemed to potentially introduce a risk of a structural [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=202.16s)]
*  integrity problem in extreme circumstances. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=210.76s)]
*  Then, the following day, Boeing flagged a third issue. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=213.24s)]
*  This one with sections of the Dreamliner's tail that were clamped together improperly [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=217.32s)]
*  during assembly. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=221.24s)]
*  It's not a question of immediate structural integrity. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=222.24s)]
*  It's a question of whether or not they introduced premature aging, and if so, what does that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=226.44s)]
*  mean for the Dreamliners in service and how often they need to be serviced and fixed? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=230.8s)]
*  In a recent internal video, Boeing explained how thin these gaps are. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=237.4s)]
*  If you started the tail of the airplane just walking to the front, each of those sections [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  when we bring them together is within five thousandths of an inch. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=246.04s)]
*  You'll hear people talk of gaps. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=250.16s)]
*  It's really not what you would normally think of as a gap. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=251.92s)]
*  The next month, in October, Boeing halted delivery of the Dreamliners. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=255.0s)]
*  Halting deliveries is a big deal. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  In effect, that means Boeing can't sell the products. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=261.8s)]
*  Dreamliners largely pay Boeing on delivery. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=264.92s)]
*  Prior to the halt, many of Boeing's commercial deliveries were Dreamliners, as the 737 MAX [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=267.52000000000004s)]
*  remained grounded following two fatal crashes of that aircraft. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  Boeing was, at that point, a month away from getting the FAA's OK to again fly passengers [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=276.44s)]
*  on a 737 MAX, and suddenly it couldn't get its other popular aircraft, the Dreamliner, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=283.88s)]
*  off the lot either. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  Then, with deliveries still halted, the plane maker expanded its inspections of the Dreamliner [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=291.56s)]
*  in December, after it found instances of the smoothness issue on new sections of the plane. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=296.12s)]
*  At that point, it became clear that the problem wasn't going away as quickly as we might [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  have thought earlier. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=308.08s)]
*  In mid-March, the FAA took back Boeing's authority to inspect and sign off on several [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=309.76s)]
*  Dreamliners awaiting delivery, saying it would conduct the checks instead. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=314.32s)]
*  It had echoes of what happened after the 737 MAX crashes. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=318.92s)]
*  This action by the FAA was a sign of its increasing scrutiny when it came to overseeing the manufacturing [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=324.12s)]
*  process of the Dreamliner. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=333.6s)]
*  But later that month, Boeing resumed Dreamliner deliveries, taking what looked like the first [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=335.0s)]
*  step toward moving past these issues. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=338.92s)]
*  In April, the company's CEO David Calhoun told investors the 787 delivery pause was [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  an example of the company trying to solve its manufacturing issues. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=346.16s)]
*  We've taken actions over this, really hard actions over the course of this year to stop [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=350.04s)]
*  things when we see an issue and get them fixed once and for all. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=355.04s)]
*  Then, in late May, deliveries were halted again as the FAA requested more information [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=358.92s)]
*  from Boeing about its proposed solution for catching and addressing the defects before [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  handing over the planes to customers. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=367.92s)]
*  Boeing was hoping that it could get FAA approval for the methodology to inspect using a mix [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=370.2s)]
*  of physical inspections and analysis. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=377.68s)]
*  With those discussions ongoing, Boeing found the latest defect around early July, this [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=380.32s)]
*  time on part of the aircraft known as the forward pressure bulkhead at the front of [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  the plane. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=388.76s)]
*  So it's going to complicate the process that was underway of Boeing trying to prove [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=389.76s)]
*  to the FAA that its methodology was sound. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=394.36s)]
*  It's still unclear when the latest issue will be resolved, though Boeing said it could [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=397.56s)]
*  take at least three weeks to address. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=401.4s)]
*  What we're doing on the 787 is a methodical program reviewing the airplane from tip to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=403.88s)]
*  tail in a way that's safe and compliant for our customers and our regulators. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=409.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, Finnish Dreamliners are piling up. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=415.48s)]
*  More than 100 planes await delivery. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=418.36s)]
*  Boeing has slowed production on the plane and said it now expects to deliver less than [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=420.72s)]
*  half of its 787 inventory this year. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=424.2s)]
*  The slowdown is likely to ripple into Boeing's vast supply network. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=427.56s)]
*  And for some weeks and months, it's going to mean that Boeing's airline customers have [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=434.64s)]
*  to wait longer to get their new Dreamliners. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=440.2s)]
*  It's unclear whether these manufacturing issues will matter in the long run. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=444.28s)]
*  Whether or not there is any long term impact, good or bad, to Boeing's reputation remains [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=448.76s)]
*  to be seen. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=455.4s)]
*  For now, the Dreamliner is still a very popular aircraft and has an excellent safety record. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivn9_4jZZ9k&t=456.76s)]
