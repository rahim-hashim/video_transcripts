# What's Google+ and How Do I Know if I Have an Account
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 11, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg)
*  Google is shutting down the consumer version of its Google Plus social network after the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=0.0s)]
*  journal revealed that it had exposed the data of hundreds of thousands of users. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=5.2s)]
*  You might be wondering, what was Google Plus again? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=9.32s)]
*  And am I affected by this situation? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=11.52s)]
*  Good questions. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=13.88s)]
*  Google launched the social network in 2011, but it never really took off. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Still, there was a stretch where Google actually required users to sign up for a Google Plus [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=19.28s)]
*  account in order to do other things, like post on YouTube. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=23.84s)]
*  So you might have an account without realizing it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=27.48s)]
*  The company discovered a software glitch in March that made it so outside developers could [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=30.04s)]
*  have accessed information from user profiles that were sent to private. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=34.28s)]
*  Information like full name, birthday, email address, gender, places you've lived, and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=39.2s)]
*  occupation, but not phone numbers, timeline posts, or direct messages. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=43.28s)]
*  The company says it fixed the bug and that there's no evidence that anyone got their [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=47.82s)]
*  hands on this data or misused it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=51.28s)]
*  But it also didn't disclose the issue to its users because it wanted to avoid the kind [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=53.84s)]
*  of public scrutiny that Facebook got after its Cambridge Analytica scandal. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=57.6s)]
*  Even though the company is planning to shut down the product for all but enterprise customers [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=61.88s)]
*  over the next 10 months, you shouldn't leave a dormant account lying around with your personal [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=65.56s)]
*  information in it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=69.48s)]
*  So here's how you delete it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=70.64s)]
*  First, check if you have an account, even if you think there's absolutely no way. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=72.12s)]
*  Log into any Gmail accounts you have and click on the little circle where your profile picture is. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=76.4s)]
*  No pick? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=81.12s)]
*  Here's the first letter of your name. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=82.16000000000001s)]
*  Next, look to see if there's a link that says Google Plus profile. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  If there is, that means you have an account. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=87.64s)]
*  Click on it and that should open your profile. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=89.84s)]
*  From there, click on settings and scroll down to the bottom where it says delete your Google [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=91.92s)]
*  Plus profile. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=95.48s)]
*  By deleting, you're getting rid of any data you have in there, so check the box saying [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=96.82000000000001s)]
*  you understand that this move can't be undone. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=100.4s)]
*  Then click delete. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=103.16s)]
*  You're done. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwY1dP4Ortg&t=104.16s)]
