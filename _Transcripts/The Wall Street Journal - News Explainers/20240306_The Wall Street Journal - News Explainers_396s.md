# A Trump vs. Biden Rematch What's Different in 2024?  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk)
*  The expected rematch between President Biden and former President Donald Trump is happening. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=0.0s)]
*  We're effectively in a general election now. That's just unprecedented in a lot of ways. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=6.0s)]
*  There's just so many unknowns. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=11.0s)]
*  While Biden faces obstacles like concerns about his age and declining approval ratings, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=13.0s)]
*  Trump is juggling a set of challenges that no presidential candidates have ever confronted. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=18.0s)]
*  Here's a look at those challenges and how Trump will try to turn them into opportunities. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=23.0s)]
*  The 2024 election is gearing up to be a face-off between the oldest nominees in history. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=29.0s)]
*  And it's going to be the first presidential rematch in the U.S. since 1956, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=35.0s)]
*  when President Dwight Eisenhower faced and defeated Adlai Stevenson for the second time. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=40.0s)]
*  The result was never in doubt. It was a landslide for the Eisenhower-Nixon ticket. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=45.0s)]
*  We know from polling and just talking to voters around the country that people are really kind of weary [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=50.0s)]
*  about the notion of a Trump-Biden matchup, but that's what we're going to have. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=55.0s)]
*  It's going to be all-consuming, I think, for the American public. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=59.0s)]
*  The race is now an endurance challenge for both candidates after Trump easily beat out his Republican rivals, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=63.0s)]
*  including Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=69.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's strength really shows how much of a hold he has on the party's base, the core voters. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=72.0s)]
*  They are willing to swing with his different positions on issues that aren't always aligned [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=78.0s)]
*  with a certain feeling that's been long baked into the Republican Party. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=83.0s)]
*  He didn't dabble much or tangle much with his rivals. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=90.0s)]
*  Trump never got on the debate stage with his rivals. He felt he didn't have to. Why should he? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=94.0s)]
*  We don't know his positions, for example, on some of the key foreign policy matters, like the war in the Middle East. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=99.0s)]
*  So it's sort of kept him out of the scrutiny of political discourse. So it worked out well for him. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=104.0s)]
*  Trump's 2024 started off pretty busy, from campaign events to court hearings. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=110.0s)]
*  I'm going to have to sit here for months on a trial. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=115.0s)]
*  And sometimes those two things lined up on back-to-back days in very different locations. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=119.0s)]
*  On February 14, Trump spoke at a campaign rally in North Charleston, South Carolina. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=124.0s)]
*  Well, thank you very much, South Carolina, and happy Valentine's Day, everybody. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=130.0s)]
*  The next day, he was in New York for a hearing over his alleged role in a scheme to pay hush money to a porn star. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=135.0s)]
*  I'll be here during the day and I'll be campaigning during the night. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=142.0s)]
*  Trump has tried and has had some success so far marrying the two. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=145.0s)]
*  Essentially, the campaign and the courtroom are the same. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=149.0s)]
*  We've seen him when he goes to court, often speaking to reporters, making sure his voice is heard. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=152.0s)]
*  It's election interference at the highest level. It's a disgrace. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=157.0s)]
*  And kind of plowing head with his message that this is all designed to stop him politically. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=161.0s)]
*  I stand before you today not only as your past and hopefully future president, but as a proud political dissident. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=167.0s)]
*  That is going to be more difficult, of course, as these cases really take hold. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=176.0s)]
*  That's going to start to really eat into his ability to be out there on the campaign trail. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=181.0s)]
*  The legal trials have also drained his political coffers. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=186.0s)]
*  In 2023, Trump's campaign spent roughly $50 million on legal fees. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=189.0s)]
*  And between two New York civil lawsuits plus interest, the former president was ordered to shell out more than half a billion dollars in financial penalties. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=194.0s)]
*  The spending for Trump on legal fees is a real open question, whether he can sustain the amount of money that he is devoting towards these cases, his lawyers and defending himself. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=203.0s)]
*  He does have the ability to raise a lot of money. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=213.0s)]
*  Every time he's going to court, every time he leaves court, they fire off a campaign email asking for more money, saying that it's not just himself that's being persecuted, but his supporters. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=216.0s)]
*  He's very good at personalizing what he's undergoing with his own supporters. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=226.0s)]
*  And a lot of people feel that way and they give more money. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=230.0s)]
*  While Trump has performed well in the GOP primaries, some warning signs indicate that voter enthusiasm for his return to the White House appears to be waning. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=234.0s)]
*  In early state elections in Iowa and New Hampshire, nearly half of primary voters didn't vote for Trump. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=243.0s)]
*  And when asked how they would feel if he became the nominee, many of the non-Trump voters in New Hampshire said they'd be so dissatisfied that they wouldn't vote for him in the general election. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=249.0s)]
*  Trump can't afford to lose too many Republican voters. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=259.0s)]
*  He's trying to pull voters back into his fold and new voters by promising an effectively return to relative economic prosperity that marked his first term until COVID. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=262.0s)]
*  The downside is that the economy is improving in a lot of ways for Joe Biden. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=272.0s)]
*  We're going to see a lot of battles over who can sustain this growth that we're seeing. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=277.0s)]
*  Biden, as the sitting president whose approval ratings continue to drop, has his own challenges ahead. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=282.0s)]
*  One of Biden's most striking vulnerabilities has come under intense scrutiny after a special counsel report investigating his mishandling of classified documents made several strong claims about his memory. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=289.0s)]
*  Something the special counsel said in his report is that one of the reasons you were not charged is because in his description you are a well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=300.0s)]
*  I'm well-meaning and I'm an elderly man and I know what the hell I'm doing. I've been president and I put this country back on its feet. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=314.0s)]
*  Age and mental acuity is one of the big issues facing Joe Biden and his attempts to win a second term. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=321.0s)]
*  We see it poll after poll that Americans, Democrats, Republicans, and independents think he is too old. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=329.0s)]
*  It's why we've seen such an aggressive attempt by the White House and Democrats to sort of frame it in different ways. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=335.0s)]
*  I'm absolutely confident based on his incredible record of success for the country that he is the right person to lead the country for another four years. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=343.0s)]
*  Age isn't the only concern. More than half of the country thinks Biden's policies during his presidency have hurt more than they've helped. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=354.0s)]
*  The faceoff between Trump and Biden will test the stamina of both candidates and the voters. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=363.0s)]
*  Polling has shown that a majority of Americans think neither Biden nor Trump should run for president again in 2024. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=368.0s)]
*  It's going to be a long, long slog, one that a lot of Americans just don't want to happen, but it's happening. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=375.0s)]
*  It's going to be an unprecedented, wild ride to the finish here and we're all going to be part of it whether you want to or not. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezvnji9xHZk&t=381.0s)]
