# How Apple and Google Formed One of Tech’s Most Powerful Partnerships | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q)
*  You've probably asked the question before. iPhone or Android? Apple Maps or Google Maps? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Safari or Chrome? On the surface, Apple and Google represent the ultimate tech rivalry. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=7.28s)]
*  But behind the scenes, executives have maintained a multi-billion dollar partnership [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=14.24s)]
*  that benefits them both massively. I would describe Apple and Google as the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=19.76s)]
*  classic example of frenemies. On one hand, they're fierce rivals. On the other hand, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=24.24s)]
*  they benefit greatly from figuring out ways to work together. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  Google pays Apple an estimated $8 to $12 billion a year, or a third of Alphabet's annual profits, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=35.2s)]
*  to make sure it's the default search engine on more than a billion Apple devices. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=42.8s)]
*  That deal has helped Google dominate the search market. In recent years, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=48.0s)]
*  it's accounted for 90 to 95 percent of search engine queries in the U.S. The deal between the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=52.48s)]
*  two tech giants is so powerful that it's at the center of one of the biggest U.S. government [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  lawsuits against a public company since the 90s. So how did two of Silicon Valley's biggest rivals [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  come to form one of tech's most valuable partnerships? To understand Apple and Google's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=70.96s)]
*  frenemy relationship, you have to go back to the beginning. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=76.24s)]
*  In the early days, they were quite close. At the time, the CEO of Google was on Apple's board. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=79.52s)]
*  It was part of the Silicon Valley club, if you will. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=86.16s)]
*  In 2005, the two companies laid the groundwork for what would become one of the industry's biggest [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  deals. Google struck a deal with Apple to become the default search engine for Safari on Mac [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=96.32s)]
*  computers. As Apple evolved, so did the relationship. In 2007, Google's first [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=102.24s)]
*  iPhone came out. Google was then the default search for the iPhone Safari browser. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=109.12s)]
*  And it's really just grown and grown from that point. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=118.4s)]
*  So Steve, you know, I've had the privilege of joining the board, and there's a lot of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=122.64s)]
*  relationships between the boards. And I thought, you know, if we just sort of merge the companies, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  we could call them Apple goo. As it became clear that Google was going to be more than [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=134.0s)]
*  just a search engine and that it wanted to grow and that Apple was going to be a rival, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=141.04s)]
*  that became an issue. In 2008, Google directly challenged Apple's business with the launch of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  its Android operating system. The next year, Google CEO Eric Schmidt resigned from Apple's board. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=154.0s)]
*  Since then, both companies have expanded into each other's businesses, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  with Google launching Android phones and Apple launching services like the App Store and Siri, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=166.16000000000003s)]
*  which was originally powered by Microsoft's Bing, not Google. Search Wikipedia for Neil Armstrong. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  Searching for Neil Armstrong. It wasn't until 2017 that Apple switched from Bing to Google for its [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=182.88000000000002s)]
*  search results on Siri and Spotlight, the Mac's search function. That renewed deal between Apple [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=189.2s)]
*  and Google came at a good time for both companies. Google was facing competition from Facebook's fast [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=195.76s)]
*  growing mobile ad revenue. And its new deal with Apple put its search results and ads on more than [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=202.32s)]
*  a billion Apple devices. Now, up to half of Google searches come from Apple devices. When you open up [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=209.2s)]
*  your iPhone and go to Safari and write something that you want to search for, boom, you're going to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=216.24s)]
*  Google. And that's a lot of value. For Apple, the deal has benefited its business twofold. First, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  it got more consistent search results across Safari, Siri and Spotlight. But perhaps more [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=229.60000000000002s)]
*  importantly, the money it gets from Google's ad revenue makes up 15 to 20 percent of Apple's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  annual profits. That's helped fund Apple's ambitions to grow its services unit, which has [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=242.08s)]
*  driven growth for the company over the past few years. Apple is like a store. It's selling its [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  shelf space, the primo shelf space. And so when you go into a store and you see those candy bars right [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=254.96s)]
*  there at the register, that's the place to be if you're selling candy bars. And so for Google, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=262.56s)]
*  they're in that default spot. Now, all of that money and search traffic could be at risk because [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=268.32s)]
*  of this lawsuit. In October, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Google over antitrust concerns. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=274.64s)]
*  The government is alleging that Google is a monopoly gatekeeper for the Internet. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=282.0s)]
*  And it says that harms customers, advertisers and competing tech companies. One way the Justice [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=286.88s)]
*  Department says Google maintains its dominance is through exclusive business deals, like through [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=293.92s)]
*  its partnership with Apple. According to the lawsuit, some people at Google called the prospect [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=299.76s)]
*  of losing its default status on Apple devices code red. Google representatives said they weren't [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=304.8s)]
*  aware of the code red language used in the lawsuit. And neither Apple or Google have officially [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=310.48s)]
*  disclosed the exact value of the deal or commented on the Justice Department's eight to twelve billion [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=316.32s)]
*  dollar projection. In a recent interview, the journal's personal tech columnist Joanna Stern [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=322.0s)]
*  asked Google's former CEO about the deal. There was ultimately a deal that I did not personally [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=328.0s)]
*  negotiate, but it was a lucrative deal for Apple. But important to say that with respect to Google [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=332.64s)]
*  and with respect to use of Google search on Apple phones, it is extremely easy to switch to another [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=339.84s)]
*  provider. Google has denied the Justice Department's allegations and said it plans to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=345.76s)]
*  challenge the lawsuit. Its chief legal officer said the lawsuit wouldn't help consumers and that its [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=351.12s)]
*  relationship with Apple is customary. Apple hasn't officially commented on the lawsuit. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=356.88s)]
*  So what happens if the Justice Department is successful in its case? This could drag out [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=363.36s)]
*  for many years. This is an interesting situation. In some ways, if the DOJ is successful, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  one of the companies that might be harmed the most here is Apple, given the fact that they perhaps [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=376.24s)]
*  have 15 or 20 percent of their profit coming from this relationship. Of course, there are other [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=380.64s)]
*  search engines out there like Bing, DuckDuckGo, Baidu and D-Index, but none of them even come [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=386.08s)]
*  close to Google's dominance. Some financial analysts say that if anyone can give Google a [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=392.47999999999996s)]
*  run for its money, it's Apple. And the antitrust lawsuit might just be the push Apple needs to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=397.76s)]
*  divorce itself from Google. We don't know exactly where Apple is going with its future plans here. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  Some have speculated that potentially this would be a good reason for Apple to develop its own [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=411.44s)]
*  search engine. Others have said potentially they might buy a search engine to beef up that capability. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=417.68s)]
*  One of the things we know about Apple over the years is that it likes to own its core competencies [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=425.36s)]
*  so it can control those worlds. And so, you know, that's always kind of hanging in the background. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  Apple hasn't responded to requests for comment on plans to create or purchase its own search engine. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=437.84s)]
*  Still, a breakup of this multi-billion dollar partnership between Apple and Google [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=444.24s)]
*  could deal a financial blow to two of the world's biggest companies. And however this relationship [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=448.8s)]
*  plays out in the future has the potential to shape the way billions of people use the internet. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=454.56s)]
*  As we see Congress and regulators debate the power of tech, this lawsuit is just yet another [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=460.08s)]
*  example of kind of that public debate about their role in our future and in our society. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akzobLE3Q&t=467.52s)]
