# Who Pays for Health Care? Depends on Where You Live | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 09, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs)
*  The coronavirus pandemic is putting healthcare systems around the world to the test. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=0.0s)]
*  In the U.S., it's also revived a debate over one of the most divisive concepts in [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=8.14s)]
*  American politics. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=12.66s)]
*  Should healthcare be free? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=14.68s)]
*  We'll remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  they need. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  In the U.S., some are worried about whether hospitals can handle the pandemic and what [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  COVID-19 treatment might cost patients. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=29.2s)]
*  While in places like Europe, Hong Kong and Australia, people are worried about hospitals [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=32.12s)]
*  too, but not so much the price tag of a hospital stay, since that's generally covered by [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=37.0s)]
*  taxes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  So we wanted to know, what works in a universal healthcare system and what doesn't? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=45.44s)]
*  I guess I have a unique view in that I've experienced I think five different healthcare [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=51.16s)]
*  systems to date. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=54.72s)]
*  A healthcare system doesn't exist in a silo, it exists within a culture. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=56.64s)]
*  We are going to lead this country into a Medicare for all single payer program. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  We have a chance of killing Obamacare. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=68.4s)]
*  We almost did it, but we'll do it a different way. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=70.88s)]
*  In some countries, universal healthcare is a point of national pride. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=74.92s)]
*  Just look at the U.K. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  When London hosted the Olympics in 2012, the opening ceremony touted the U.K.'s athletes [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=81.5s)]
*  and its healthcare system. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  Lawson, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer some years ago, said the National Health Service [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=88.92s)]
*  was the nearest thing that Great Britain had to a religion. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  Dr. Jeffrey Rivett has documented the rise of the U.K.'s National Health Service. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm a doctor, I'm in my 80s, and I spent my entire working life in the health service [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=104.36s)]
*  or in government controlling the health service. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=111.4s)]
*  Zero hour in London. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=115.84s)]
*  Chamberlain speaks. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=117.8s)]
*  A state of war exists with Germany. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=118.8s)]
*  So when for us the war broke out on 3rd September 1939, major hospitals were evacuated to the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=121.92s)]
*  country, temporary hospitals were established, and an emergency hospital service which was [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=128.6s)]
*  free and organized by command and control took over. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=133.8s)]
*  From that moment, having got a command and control system under the threat of war, there [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=138.0s)]
*  was no way of going back. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=143.36s)]
*  As European countries dealt with the demand for medical care that came from World War [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=145.68s)]
*  II, many built in some form of government-run healthcare. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=149.68s)]
*  This new health service will be organized on a national scale as a public responsibility. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, what was going on in the U.S. is that President Truman put the weight of the presidency [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=158.96s)]
*  behind a plan to have universal healthcare, but he was unable to get that through Congress. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  That's Martin Gorski. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=175.64s)]
*  He's a healthcare historian and he's thought a lot about how the American healthcare system [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=176.64s)]
*  came to be. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=181.72s)]
*  You know, there were arguments at the time about American character, American national [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=182.72s)]
*  culture, you know, the famous pioneer spirit, the freedom of the individual. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=188.67999999999998s)]
*  American culture evolved over time, and in the 60s, President Lyndon B. Johnson enacted [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=194.32s)]
*  Medicare and Medicaid. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=200.2s)]
*  Today, the U.S. government still funds some programs that could be considered socialized [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=203.64s)]
*  medicine. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=208.32s)]
*  Think Medicare for the elderly and disabled, Medicaid for low-income Americans, and VA [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=209.32s)]
*  healthcare for veterans. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  America also has some of the best doctors and research facilities in the world. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  But there's no universal program that covers healthcare for everybody. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=221.76s)]
*  Kelvin and Enrique Childress have lived all over the world, and their family has experienced [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=226.67999999999998s)]
*  a range of both public and private healthcare systems. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=231.48s)]
*  So I grew up in Nebraska, in the middle of the country, in a small community. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=235.76s)]
*  So when we first met each other and then eventually got together and got married, her coming from [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=240.72s)]
*  a country where there is socialized benefits like socialized healthcare and stuff like [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  that, I definitely gave her a hard time for that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=249.72s)]
*  Very, very regularly, up until we'd been married for four or five years, and I still [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=251.76s)]
*  was giving her a hard time. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=255.72s)]
*  Up till we moved to the UK. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=257.24s)]
*  Like in most European countries, any UK resident can walk into a hospital and get free basic [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=261.0s)]
*  care from the NHS. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=266.44s)]
*  Most prescriptions cost just $10 each. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=268.66s)]
*  Kids, the elderly, and patients with conditions like cancer or some cases of diabetes don't [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=271.36s)]
*  pay anything out of pocket. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=277.12s)]
*  If you want to pay extra for private care because you want to get to see a doctor faster, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=279.16s)]
*  or need more specialized care than the NHS can readily provide, you can do that too. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=283.86s)]
*  Having that option to go private is common in most countries with universal healthcare. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=289.76s)]
*  In the States, you are being provided with a product and it's being presented to you [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=294.44s)]
*  as it's more of like an experience where you're going, it's going to be a really nice waiting [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  room. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=302.36s)]
*  You're going to have really nice chairs and a TV on for you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=303.36s)]
*  Whereas when we go here, the weight room is nice, it's fine. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=306.08s)]
*  There are chairs that we can sit in. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=310.2s)]
*  There's, you know, you're not going to be sitting in the cold or anything like that, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=311.52s)]
*  but it is a very different environment. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=314.6s)]
*  In both systems, there's a cost to the care. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=319.36s)]
*  The biggest difference is whether it's being paid for by the country as a whole or individual [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  patients. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  The budget to run the NHS in 2019 was roughly $170 billion. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=329.24s)]
*  That money comes mostly from taxes. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=334.92s)]
*  Coming here, it was a pretty big shock, you know, negotiating a salary and getting that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=337.88s)]
*  first paycheck and going, something must be wrong here, and looking and seeing, you know, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  30% of the check was to taxes and all of those things. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=346.16s)]
*  But that 30%, I mean, when we looked at it and broke it down, what we were paying for [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=350.64000000000004s)]
*  insurance back in the States, it wouldn't have been a difference really. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=355.32000000000005s)]
*  I mean, I think it would be slightly higher. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=358.16s)]
*  And I think there is there's no price on peace of mind. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=360.16s)]
*  As a percentage of its GDP, the U.S. actually spends more on health care than any other [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=364.84000000000003s)]
*  developed country. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=369.6s)]
*  It's roughly 17% in the U.S. and just 9.6% in the UK. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=371.92s)]
*  Researchers say that's because of higher prices. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=377.36s)]
*  The U.S. has higher drug prices, doctor salaries and hospital admin costs. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=380.64000000000004s)]
*  While much of the health care sector in the U.S. is focused on turning a profit, in a [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=386.12s)]
*  country like the UK, the National Health Service is seen as part of the government. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=390.72s)]
*  All the main political parties are promising more money for England's NHS, but it's [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=395.88s)]
*  needed now. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=399.72s)]
*  Already delays in treatment and staff shortages are at record levels. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=400.96s)]
*  Save our NHS! [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=404.88s)]
*  When the government dials back its spending, the health care system suffers cuts too. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=408.88s)]
*  NHS providers ended 2019 with a roughly $700 million deficit. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  Some providers have tried to make up for that by cutting costs and hiring private contractors [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=420.59999999999997s)]
*  to run parts of the system, like specialized care or food services. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=425.28s)]
*  There are definitely cons. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=430.16s)]
*  So, for example, if you're getting something done that is non-emergent, it does take time [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=431.16s)]
*  to get it in and get seen. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=435.52000000000004s)]
*  As hospital services get cut and the population gets older, UK hospitals have become overcrowded, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  causing sometimes months-long wait times for non-emergency procedures. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=444.12s)]
*  Even if America were to create its own universal health care system one day, it would look [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  much different than anything that exists elsewhere today. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=454.88s)]
*  The US already has a trillion-dollar health insurance industry. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=459.36s)]
*  There's hundreds of millions of dollars spent on healthcare lobbying every year, and [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  the cultural attitude towards taxes is just different from other countries. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=467.64s)]
*  So politicians in the US have proposed a range of changes, from replacing the Affordable [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=472.44s)]
*  Care Act altogether to a single-payer system, or a mix of private and public options. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=477.76s)]
*  I think that it's easy for people in smaller countries, like the UK, to say, well, why [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=483.84s)]
*  don't they just do something like this in the States? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  And I think it's really easy for someone in the States to say, well, you're a really [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=491.59999999999997s)]
*  small country, of course you can do it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=494.79999999999995s)]
*  And I think both people are right. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=496.47999999999996s)]
*  The coronavirus pandemic has brought the government's attention to the health care system. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=498.23999999999995s)]
*  Congress passed a bill making all COVID-19 testing free for patients. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbSeJWg9MBs&t=503.35999999999996s)]
