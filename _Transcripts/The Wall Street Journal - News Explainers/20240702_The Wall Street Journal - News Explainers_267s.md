# Trump’s Immunity Legal Expert Breaks Down Supreme Court Ruling  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4)
*  The Supreme Court delivered a heavy blow to special counsel Jack Smith's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=0.0s)]
*  election interference case against former president Donald Trump, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=4.32s)]
*  ruling along partisan lines that Trump has broad immunity for acts taken while he was in office. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=7.94s)]
*  This will be referred to from now on as a landmark opinion of the Supreme Court. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=14.32s)]
*  It's not only important for President Trump's criminal case, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=19.6s)]
*  they really have set a framework for all future presidents. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=22.8s)]
*  In August 2023, a federal grand jury indicted Trump in an unprecedented criminal case, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=27.44s)]
*  charging the former president with four crimes related to his alleged attempts to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  overturn the 2020 election. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump's defense team puts forward this argument that a former president should be held [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=39.6s)]
*  completely immune from prosecution for any of the acts that they performed while in office. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=45.28s)]
*  I feel that as a president you have to have immunity, very simple. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=51.6s)]
*  After a lower court rejected Trump's immunity claims, the former president appealed, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=55.68s)]
*  and on July 1st, the Supreme Court gave him a sweeping amount of protection against criminal prosecution. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=59.84s)]
*  The court's very explicit about this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=67.12s)]
*  It lays out its framework by saying, quote, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=69.12s)]
*  the nature of presidential power entitles a former president to absolute immunity from criminal [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=71.6s)]
*  prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=77.84s)]
*  What the court is saying in this part is quite surprising. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=82.56s)]
*  They're basically saying that nothing he does in terms of pressuring the Justice Department [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=85.2s)]
*  to investigate whoever he wants to investigate as president can ever be subject to criminal liability. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=89.44s)]
*  The high court's opinion also says that Trump is entitled at a minimum to presumptive immunity [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  from prosecution for all his official acts. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=101.04s)]
*  However, a court could determine that some conduct, such as a campaign speech or fundraising, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=103.76s)]
*  constitutes an unofficial act. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  The Supreme Court says, quote, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=110.88s)]
*  the president enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts and not everything the president does [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=112.56s)]
*  is official, end quote. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  So a big question here is when was President Trump acting in his official capacity [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=119.44s)]
*  as president of the United States versus when was he acting as candidate for reelection? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=124.56s)]
*  We will never concede. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=129.04s)]
*  It doesn't happen. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=130.56s)]
*  You don't concede when there's death involved. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=131.68s)]
*  When President Trump gives his speech at the Ellipse on January 6th [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=134.8s)]
*  and suggests to his supporters to go to the Capitol, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=138.88000000000002s)]
*  is he speaking as political candidate or is he speaking as president? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=141.52s)]
*  The majority opinion doesn't tell us which. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=144.96s)]
*  They give the lower courts some, quote, unquote, guidance. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  But that will be a key determination as to whether that can even be part of the allegations, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=149.84s)]
*  even part of the evidence that could be used at trial. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=154.16000000000003s)]
*  The court's three liberal justices could barely contain their outrage. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=157.68s)]
*  The dissenter said the majority opinion makes a mockery of the principle foundational [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  to our constitution and system of government, that no man is above the law. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=166.8s)]
*  Having won from the court nearly everything he could have hoped for, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=171.68s)]
*  Trump celebrated in a truth social post, writing, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=175.28s)]
*  Big win for our constitution and democracy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  President Biden called the court's decision a terrible disservice [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=181.84s)]
*  to the people of this nation. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  Today's decision almost certainly means that there are virtually no limits [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=186.88000000000002s)]
*  on what a president can do. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  This is a fundamentally new principle. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=193.28s)]
*  And it's a dangerous precedent. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  The ruling sends the case back to federal district judge Tanya Chutkin in Washington. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  The next step is for Judge Chutkin to engage in what we call fact finding. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=202.8s)]
*  She will now apply the Supreme Court's framework to the allegations to determine [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=207.12s)]
*  what is official versus unofficial conduct. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  If it is official conduct, is it absolutely immune? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=214.8s)]
*  If it's not absolutely immune, is it presumptively immune? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=218.0s)]
*  And if it's presumptively immune, could the government rebut the presumption? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  That's all a hodgepodge of very difficult legal questions. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=223.76s)]
*  I think it's inconceivable that there will be a criminal trial before the election. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  If Trump is elected to a second term, experts say he has several options to quash the case. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=233.44s)]
*  President Trump would be the head of the executive branch of the Justice Department. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  He could order the Justice Department just to stand down. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=243.68s)]
*  He could say on day one, I have determined this was a witch hunt. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=246.0s)]
*  President Trump could potentially try to issue a self-pardon. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=250.16s)]
*  Though that's more controversial, and even the Justice Department [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=253.2s)]
*  in the distant past has said that a president cannot pardon himself. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc4_RFeKaz4&t=256.64s)]
