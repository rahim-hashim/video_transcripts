# Vance vs. Walz Highlights VP Candidates Spar in Policy-Heavy Debate  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c)
*  The stage is set. Governor, Senator, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=0.0s)]
*  This debate was policy rich. Immigration policy, abortion policy, foreign policy, housing policy, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=5.2s)]
*  tax policy. If you're a policy person, this was your debate. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  First of all, Tim just said something that I agree with. We don't want to blame immigrants [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=14.92s)]
*  for higher housing prices, but we do want to blame Kamala Harris for letting in millions [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=18.92s)]
*  of illegal aliens into this country. Pass the bill. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Which does drive up cost, Tim. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=25.62s)]
*  You're pro-freedom to make your own choice. We know what the implications are to not be that. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=28.22s)]
*  Women having miscarriages, women not getting the care, physicians feeling like they may be prosecuted [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=32.94s)]
*  for providing that care. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=39.94s)]
*  A lot of those same economists attacked Donald Trump's plans and they have PhDs but they don't have common sense [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=41.44s)]
*  and they don't have wisdom. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=46.94s)]
*  Both vice presidential candidates were mostly civil with each other, but they did focus [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=48.54s)]
*  their attacks on the presidential candidates, Harrison Trump. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=52.54s)]
*  We have a lot to get through. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=56.14s)]
*  I believe Senator Vance wants to solve this, but by standing with Donald Trump and not [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=57.6s)]
*  working together to find a solution, it becomes a talking point. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=62.6s)]
*  I agree with you. I think you want to solve this problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=65.78s)]
*  Senator Vance came into this debate with an underwater approval rating. More Americans [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=69.98s)]
*  don't like him than do like him. He did a really effective job of softening his image, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=73.97999999999999s)]
*  of speaking right to Americans, of talking about middle class Americans and the issues [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=78.98s)]
*  they face, and in that respect, he had a very good debate. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=82.58s)]
*  We've got to do a better job at winning back people's trust. So many young women would [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=85.98s)]
*  love to have families. So many young women also see an unplanned pregnancy as something [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=90.18s)]
*  that's going to destroy their livelihood, destroy their education, destroy their relationships, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=94.58s)]
*  and we have got to earn people's trust back. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=98.98s)]
*  Vance went out of his way to make Trump's bumper sticker policies seem more digestible [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=101.68s)]
*  to the American people. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=106.78s)]
*  So we've got 20, 25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country. What do we do [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=108.18s)]
*  with them? I think the first thing that we do is we start with the criminal migrants. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=112.18s)]
*  About a million of those people have committed some form of crime in addition to crossing [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=115.78s)]
*  the border illegally. I think you start with deportations on those folks. And then I think [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=120.48s)]
*  you make it harder for illegal aliens to undercut the wages of American workers. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=125.28s)]
*  Vance's performance was very polished. He's a very good public speaker. He's, you know, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=129.38s)]
*  this is what he does best. And Walls at times seemed very folksy. He misspoke on several [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=133.58s)]
*  occasions. His performance could be a little bit halting at times and uneven. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=140.08s)]
*  I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect. And I'm a knucklehead at [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=144.18s)]
*  times, but it's always been about that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=148.18s)]
*  Governor Walls seemed the most uncomfortable when the debate began because it began with [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=150.18s)]
*  the question about foreign policy, which is not his strong suit. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=153.78s)]
*  Iran, Israel's ability to be able to defend itself is absolutely fundamental. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=156.58s)]
*  I think he really felt incredibly comfortable when he was talking about Minnesota. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=162.38s)]
*  We should be making more of those solar panels here in the United States of America. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=166.38s)]
*  We in Minnesota passed a paid family medical leave. In Minnesota, we've enacted, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=169.98s)]
*  enhanced red flag laws, enhanced background checks. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=175.38s)]
*  One of Walls's strongest moments of the debate came at the end when Senator Vance was [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=179.78s)]
*  asked whether if he was vice president for Trump in the first term, if he would have [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=184.17999999999998s)]
*  done what Vice President Pence did, which was to certify the election results. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=188.38s)]
*  This was a threat to our democracy in a way that we had not seen. And it manifested itself [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=192.57999999999998s)]
*  because of Donald Trump's inability to say. He is still saying he didn't lose the election. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=197.78s)]
*  I would just ask that. Did he lose the 2020 election? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=202.18s)]
*  Tim, I'm focused on the future. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=205.18s)]
*  Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 COVID situation? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=207.18s)]
*  That is a damning non-answer. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=214.18s)]
*  This debate had many differences of opinion, but it was striking how many times they agreed [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=217.18s)]
*  with each other. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=221.98s)]
*  Much of what the senator said right there, I'm in agreement with him on this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=222.78s)]
*  And I think that Governor Walz and I actually probably agree that we need to do better on this. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=226.18s)]
*  I think that might be one of the things this debate is remembered for. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=229.78s)]
*  Because neither of these candidates were very well known, it did offer a big opportunity [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  for both of them to reintroduce themselves to America. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jErjxOmL_9c&t=237.18s)]
