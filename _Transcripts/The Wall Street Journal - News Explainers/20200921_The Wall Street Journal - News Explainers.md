# Nikola and the Race to Find the Next Tesla  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg)
*  These trucks are designed to run on electricity, not gas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=0.0s)]
*  And some investors are betting that they're the future. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=5.0s)]
*  The pressure is mounting for one company in particular. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=8.0s)]
*  Nicola. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=11.0s)]
*  Nicola. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=12.0s)]
*  Nicola. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=13.0s)]
*  Shares for the electric and hydrogen vehicle startup have seen big swings this year, despite [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=14.0s)]
*  the company having yet to sell a single truck. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=17.6s)]
*  In September, shares rose 11% in a single day after the company struck a deal with General [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=20.0s)]
*  Motors. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=25.1s)]
*  And then crashed in response to a short seller's allegations of fraud and an investigation [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=26.24s)]
*  into whether the company had misrepresented its progress to investors. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=31.58s)]
*  Founder Trevor Milton stepped down following the allegations. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=36.04s)]
*  The buzzer on Nicola represents a larger trend in the market. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  Investors and big automakers looking for a piece of EV startups in a quest to find the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=43.42s)]
*  next Tesla. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=47.58s)]
*  The Nicola story is a fear of missing out story. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=48.58s)]
*  Is Nicola the next Tesla? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  Is Nicola the gamble that I need to make today that I either didn't make before or want [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=54.92s)]
*  to make again? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=60.04s)]
*  To understand, you have to look back to 2010, when Tesla Motors was just taking hold in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=62.56s)]
*  the auto world. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=67.04s)]
*  For a long time, Tesla was seen as this complete anomaly to a pretty consistent story, which [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=68.6s)]
*  was investors did not like electric cars. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=75.82000000000001s)]
*  And the reason they didn't like electric cars is because they lose money. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  But in 2010, Tesla announced a partnership with Toyota. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  In return for an auto factory in Fremont, California, Toyota would receive a $50 million [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  stake in the electric vehicle startup. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=90.44s)]
*  A month later, Tesla went public and its stock surged. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=92.84s)]
*  Tesla started to make money. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=96.84s)]
*  They started to show some degree of market share penetration. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  And probably most importantly, they proved that they know how to build cars. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=104.48s)]
*  In March 2016, Toyota's 2.3 million Tesla shares were valued at $480 million. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=110.08s)]
*  And by the end of the year, the company cashed out. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=116.6s)]
*  The relationship between Toyota and Tesla was one necessity in the beginning. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=118.84s)]
*  Toyota had something to gain. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=121.92s)]
*  Tesla had something to gain. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=123.36s)]
*  It was a factory and it was technology. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=124.36s)]
*  Toyota minimized the potential of Tesla's technology and Tesla ran away with the factory [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=126.84s)]
*  and used it to become a significant player in the luxury car market. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=134.0s)]
*  Now other automotive heavyweights want to find the next Tesla and hold on to it with [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=139.6s)]
*  the hopes of cashing in. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=144.72s)]
*  Introducing the most advanced semi truck the world has ever seen. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=145.92s)]
*  Some are betting on Nikola, named after the famous engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  The connection to rival car company Tesla is no coincidence. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=156.84s)]
*  By 2016, Tesla was already a household name and Nikola took the opportunity to capitalize [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=160.56s)]
*  on its popularity. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  When the company announced its first vehicles that year, it came with big promises. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  It's my pleasure to introduce the Nikola 1 to the world. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=172.72s)]
*  Just months later, Tesla also made a wager that big rig EV trucks would be a hit. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=182.36s)]
*  We are guaranteeing that this truck will not break down for a million miles. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  Following the reveal, investors piled in to Tesla stock. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=193.92s)]
*  Both companies were promising to wean the trucking industry off diesel, but using different [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  approaches. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=205.44s)]
*  Tesla committed to all electric vehicles, while Nikola said that hydrogen fuel cell [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=206.44s)]
*  technology in addition to electric would better power the trucks. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  The ability to outperform a diesel in every category, not only that but 100% zero emission. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=214.83999999999997s)]
*  Musk hasn't always shared the same views about hydrogen. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=219.48s)]
*  If you're going to pick an energy storage mechanism, hydrogen is an incredibly dumb [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=222.67999999999998s)]
*  one to pick. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=226.16s)]
*  While hydrogen fuel has captivated public interest for years, companies have struggled [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=227.16s)]
*  to bring the technology to scale. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=231.39999999999998s)]
*  It's very expensive and it's also very difficult to get a fueling infrastructure. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=233.6s)]
*  When you think about the Big Mac truck, they're still running on diesel right now or they're [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  still using a combination of powertrains, engines and stuff to get down the road. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=243.48s)]
*  There aren't charging stations all over America, you know, just waiting for a semi-truck [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=247.88s)]
*  to come in and plug in. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=252.0s)]
*  For years, Nikola has assured investors that it had plans for a network of hydrogen fueling [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=254.0s)]
*  stations as well as new battery technology. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=258.8s)]
*  But so far, these promises remain unfulfilled and some skeptics are wary of Nikola's ability [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=261.32s)]
*  to follow through. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=267.08s)]
*  They have investors that stand behind them, they have a ton of engineers that work for [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=268.08s)]
*  them, they have a lot of capital and they have customers that believe in them. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  But the one thing they don't have is a provable product on the road. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=275.86s)]
*  Right now we're almost entirely in the hype phase of electric semi-trucks. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=279.36s)]
*  Despite this, investors have still piled on and companies have placed large orders for [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=284.58000000000004s)]
*  trucks that have yet to be made. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  In 2018, Anheuser-Busch placed an order for 800 of Nikola's hydrogen electric trucks. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=290.86s)]
*  And to demonstrate the technology, Nikola completed what it claims was the world's [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=297.52000000000004s)]
*  first zero-emission beer delivery a year later, near Anheuser-Busch's headquarters in St. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=301.90000000000003s)]
*  Louis. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=306.86s)]
*  The trucks were slated for delivery in 2020, but the company later pushed that deadline. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=307.86s)]
*  There are investors who put an awful lot of money, we're talking hundreds of millions [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=313.54s)]
*  of dollars into this company, saying that they have seen the technology and that they [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=317.94000000000005s)]
*  are true believers. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=322.06s)]
*  And these are automotive experts. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=323.82000000000005s)]
*  But as we sit here, in 2020, they have not earned a single dollar of revenue doing these [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=325.58s)]
*  plans. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=334.58s)]
*  So that's why there's big skepticism. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=336.14s)]
*  Still in June 2020, the company went public through a reverse merger, which is when a [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=338.46s)]
*  public shell company invests money in a private company and combines with it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=343.26s)]
*  Nikola's market share briefly surged, passed forward. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=347.82s)]
*  And though the company has gained a lot of attention, it's not the only electric truck [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=351.74s)]
*  maker on the scene. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=355.22s)]
*  There's BYD, there's Volvo, there's Daimler, there's Navistar, and the list goes on and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=356.22s)]
*  on. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=362.86s)]
*  With Nikola's stock riding high, in August it released an earnings report that it had [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=363.86s)]
*  lost $86 million while pulling in essentially no revenue. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=367.90000000000003s)]
*  And just a week later, the company bagged another deal. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=371.94s)]
*  Shares of Nikola surging today, the company inking a deal with waste management giant [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=375.3s)]
*  Republic Services to provide 2,500 electric garbage trucks. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=379.02s)]
*  Shortly after, the company announced the partnership with GM. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=383.94s)]
*  Nikola forming a strategic partnership with General Motors this morning. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=386.97999999999996s)]
*  Nikola Badger will be engineered and manufactured by GM. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=390.9s)]
*  As a result, GM will get an 11 percent stake in Nikola and a seat on its board. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=394.7s)]
*  GM will also be supplying its own battery and hydrogen fuel cell technology. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=399.62s)]
*  We realized we shared a common vision of the world of creating an all-electric feature. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=404.53999999999996s)]
*  Amid a rush of positive press, Nikola's shares soared. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=409.38s)]
*  Companies like General Motors and Ford Motor Company are very eager to find partnerships [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=413.18s)]
*  that they can rely on. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=417.3s)]
*  And it shows you they do not want to deal with the downside of losing influence with [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=418.78000000000003s)]
*  a company that could be a big deal. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=422.78000000000003s)]
*  Still, skeptics are making bets that the company will fail. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=425.38s)]
*  Just days after the partnership with GM was announced, a short seller released a report [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=428.58s)]
*  accusing Nikola of fraud. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=433.06s)]
*  And later, news surfaced that federal prosecutors were probing allegations that Nikola misrepresented [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=435.18s)]
*  progress made in developing its technology. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=441.1s)]
*  Nikola denies allegations of fraud. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=443.98s)]
*  And GM says they will continue to work with Nikola to engineer and build the Nikola Badger [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=446.74s)]
*  and that teaming with Nikola is just one part of its overall EV strategy. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=451.98s)]
*  So is Nikola the next Tesla? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=458.02s)]
*  For some investors, the risk of partnering with an EV startup is worth the potential [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=460.18s)]
*  reward. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q9S7vEivGg&t=464.18s)]
