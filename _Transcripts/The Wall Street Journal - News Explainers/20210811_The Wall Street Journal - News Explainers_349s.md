# How Scarlett Johansson’s Disney Lawsuit Could Change Actor Pay  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 11, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0)
*  Hold that smile for us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=0.0s)]
*  Actors are looking to renegotiate their contracts in big budget movies. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=1.6400000000000001s)]
*  Scarlett Johansson, the star of Disney's latest Marvel movie, Black Widow, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=5.36s)]
*  has filed a lawsuit today in Los Angeles Superior Court against Disney. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=9.84s)]
*  Traditional movie contracts for A-list talent include sizable upfront payments [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=14.32s)]
*  and a lucrative back-end deal based mostly on box office ticket sales. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  But with more films going straight to streaming platforms, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=21.84s)]
*  actors are now looking for a piece of the streaming profits. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=24.32s)]
*  The movie wouldn't exist without actors, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=27.6s)]
*  and especially actors of certain stature and with certain names. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=29.44s)]
*  They drive people to those theaters or they drive people to download that subscription service. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  And I do believe that they should get a portion of that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=37.92s)]
*  Paying stars a bigger piece of digital sales would upend the traditional pay structure for talent. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  And for some, it could lead to tens of millions of dollars in residual pay. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=46.0s)]
*  Money, that agents and actors say, is now being left on the table. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=49.92s)]
*  Here's a look at how the Scarlett Johansson lawsuit against Disney [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=54.0s)]
*  could be a catalyst that changes the way Hollywood stars get paid. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=56.96s)]
*  To understand what's at stake with actors, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=64.0s)]
*  you have to understand how their pay is tied to a film's distribution cycle. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=66.16s)]
*  There are so many unique and creative ways for actors and performers [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=69.92s)]
*  to make additional compensation for their participation in films. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  Natasha Matalana, who's been representing actors for over 15 years, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=78.08s)]
*  says depending on the contract, back-end bonuses in the long run [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=81.76s)]
*  can be more lucrative for actors than an upfront payment. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=84.88s)]
*  Some of that compensation is creatively carved out by way of calling it a production fee [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  or a marketing fee or back-end points. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=94.96s)]
*  Those bonuses are tied to how well the film does at each point of the distribution cycle. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=97.6s)]
*  Traditionally, that cycle looks like this. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  Feature films start their journey with a theatrical release that can last anywhere from a few weeks [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=104.32s)]
*  to a few months, depending on how well it does in the box office. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=108.8s)]
*  At this stage, talent contracts for actors can include a cut of the opening box office sales. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  After it's run in the theaters, a film would then make its way on the DVD or pay-per-view. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  Depending on their contract, an actor might make a cut of that as well. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=121.52s)]
*  About six months after that, the title would become available on streaming services, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  like Disney Plus or Hulu. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  This gives talent another opportunity to cash in, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  this time for licensing deals with various streaming content providers. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  Eventually, if a film was well received, it could also end up syndicated on television. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=137.12s)]
*  Syndicated films can continue to make money for studios and talent [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=141.76s)]
*  as long as the broadcaster continues to license and air the film. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=144.72s)]
*  So that's what it looked like before. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  Here's what it's starting to look like today. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=149.76s)]
*  Studios like Disney and WarnerMedia are releasing films both in theaters for cinema goers [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  and online for the at-home audience at the same time. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  Viewers who watch in theaters pay the normal price per ticket for admission, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=159.12s)]
*  and those who watch at home might pay twice. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=162.88s)]
*  Once for a monthly subscription, and depending on the streaming service, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=165.6s)]
*  again with a surcharge for early access to the film. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=169.04s)]
*  Unlike box office, retail DVD, and licensing, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=171.92s)]
*  streaming surcharges and subscription fees are usually not split with the talent. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=174.88s)]
*  Depending on the actor's contract, they may still retain their back-end residuals [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=178.88s)]
*  for things like DVD sales, foreign sales, and pay-per-views. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  But those have always been far less lucrative compared to box office bonuses. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=185.92s)]
*  With direct-to-streaming, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  studios have found a promising solution for poor box office sales. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=191.2s)]
*  Actors and agents argue that same-day streaming is in direct competition [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=194.48s)]
*  with a theatrical release, and they're taking a huge loss in back-end residuals. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=198.24s)]
*  Well Disney says they made about $60 million just from the digital side of that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  when they released Black Widow. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=208.56s)]
*  Dan Gallagher, who's been following the rise in popularity of streaming platforms [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=210.0s)]
*  for the Wall Street Journal, says Disney stockholders really wanted to see them invest [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=213.12s)]
*  in the streaming future. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=217.36s)]
*  When you put something out like Black Widow where people have a choice on the day of, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=218.56s)]
*  there's always going to be some number that choose that convenience. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=222.8s)]
*  So it really can't help but cannibalize some of that theatrical return. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=225.36s)]
*  At least two million households purchased the $30 early access stream [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=229.44000000000003s)]
*  on the film's opening weekend. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  Johansson's lawsuit argues that her contract with Disney's Marvel Entertainment [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  guaranteed an exclusive theatrical release, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  and her salary was tied to the box office performance of the film. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  However, the film was released in theaters and on Disney Plus at the same time. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=244.24s)]
*  The decision that a person familiar with the details of her contract said [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=248.4s)]
*  would cost her more than $50 million. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=251.68s)]
*  Disney said it fully complied with Johansson's contract, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=254.32s)]
*  and that the release of Black Widow on Disney Plus has significantly enhanced [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=256.88s)]
*  the actor's ability to earn additional compensation. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=260.88s)]
*  Digital film releases are happening more and more. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=263.76s)]
*  According to Real Good, straight-to-video-on-demand movie premieres [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=266.08s)]
*  have more than tripled in Q4 year over year. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=268.96s)]
*  In 2020, 228 film titles went straight to subscription videos on demand. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=271.92s)]
*  The pandemic played a large part in accelerating the shift to premiering films online, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=276.4s)]
*  but that option was already in motion before theaters began to close. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=280.4s)]
*  I definitely think that this is a path that perhaps we were always headed down. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=284.08s)]
*  I just think that it might have been a couple of years down the road, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  and now because of COVID, it made it go fast. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  So what are contracts going to look like moving forward? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  Matalana says that actors will need to negotiate contracts [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=298.4s)]
*  that focus far less on box office ticket sales, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=301.2s)]
*  and A-list actors will likely try to negotiate a cut of any surcharge fees [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=304.4s)]
*  for early access to their new films. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  Actors with enough star power may even be entitled to revenue [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=310.16s)]
*  from new subscribers during a film's release. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=313.12s)]
*  2020 was a very ideal environment for streaming [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=315.76000000000005s)]
*  because people didn't have a lot of options. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=319.36s)]
*  In a world where people have more entertainment options, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=321.36s)]
*  it's going to normalize to something, I think bigger than it was prior to the pandemic. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  Streaming new movies at home is convenient for viewers, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=329.68s)]
*  and for streaming platforms, very profitable. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=332.56s)]
*  Agents and actors know this, and experts say that moving forward, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  they'll start looking for new and creative ways to negotiate their way into contracts [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=338.16s)]
*  that cut themselves in on the streaming profits. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxC_Rufkx-0&t=342.40000000000003s)]
