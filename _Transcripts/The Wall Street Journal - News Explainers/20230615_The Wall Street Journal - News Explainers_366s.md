# How Jerome Powell Handles the U.S. Economy | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY)
*  When Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=0.0s)]
*  Today, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by a quarter percentage point. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=2.92s)]
*  the markets move. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=7.16s)]
*  That's because the head of the US Federal Reserve is the most powerful economic voice in the nation. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=9.16s)]
*  And Fed chairs can generally be put into two categories. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=15.32s)]
*  Hawks are more worried about controlling inflation, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=19.32s)]
*  and doves tend to be more worried about making sure the employment market's strong. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=22.68s)]
*  But Powell isn't one or the other. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=27.68s)]
*  Here's how Powell's mindset helped him rise to the top, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=30.32s)]
*  and keep the Fed united. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=33.8s)]
*  The US Federal Reserve functions as a bank for banks. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=36.68s)]
*  We look after the overall stability of the financial system, and we have tools to do that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=40.44s)]
*  Recently, most Fed chairs have been academics or economists, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=44.68s)]
*  so he's a little bit different from the Fed chairs that we've had in the past few decades. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=49.0s)]
*  He was never trained in formal economic modeling. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=53.84s)]
*  But he's smart, and he's got a great staff, and he catches on. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=56.76s)]
*  After a career in investment banking and law in New York, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  Powell left to become an undersecretary at the Treasury. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=63.92s)]
*  Speaking for myself, that accounted in large measure for my own conduct at the meeting, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=67.36s)]
*  which was to be fairly passive. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=73.48s)]
*  In 2012, he joined the Fed's Board of Governors to help guide the organization. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  He has a fine reputation. He should be a fine member. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=79.56s)]
*  But his practical experience in finance gave him a different skill set. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=83.36s)]
*  Powell hasn't been preparing his whole life to be Fed chair. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  He hasn't been part of this priesthood of monetary policy theorists. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  And so that's brought different strengths and weaknesses for him in the job. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  He watches the data. He listens to what economists and modelers say [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=100.88s)]
*  and what financial market people are saying, but not what politicians are saying. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  His prioritization of data, not economic models, has meant that he's not always a hawk, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=110.12s)]
*  economic shorthand for those who prioritize fighting inflation. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=115.76s)]
*  And he's not always a dove, taking action to boost employment. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=119.4s)]
*  He's a pragmatist. He's a realist. He's not an ideologue. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  And so he's going to change his mind when he sees the facts on the ground changing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  And things certainly changed in March 2020. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=132.44s)]
*  The toll is growing by the hour. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=135.56s)]
*  Major retailers are also going dark. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=138.28s)]
*  It doesn't seem fair that people should lose everything they have, including their homes, over this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  Powell's data-driven mentality was guiding the largest economic stimulus plan ever undertaken in the U.S. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=145.72s)]
*  At that point, the whole Federal Reserve Board, certainly including Jay Powell, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=152.44s)]
*  are leaning very strongly in the dovish direction. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  The Fed can also contribute in important ways by providing a measure of relief and stability [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=160.0s)]
*  during this period of constrained economic activity and by using our tools to ensure that the eventual recovery is as vigorous as possible. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=165.0s)]
*  In his response to the emergency, Powell stretched his power farther than Fed chairs had done before. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=172.64s)]
*  He got after his staff. He said, we're falling behind this thing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=178.48s)]
*  He said, it feels like we're swimming after a speedboat. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=182.0s)]
*  He encouraged them to really get on top of this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=184.36s)]
*  And they just announced a bunch of stuff this one weekend of March 2020. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=186.44s)]
*  He instructed the Fed to begin a torrent of bond buying programs to stabilize markets and slash interest rates. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  That month, it bought Treasury and mortgage securities at a pace of nearly $75 billion a day. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  The criticism on Powell has been that maybe he overreacts to the problem at the moment. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=204.2s)]
*  So you kept interest rates too low when maybe you should have been more concerned about the risk of an inflation shock. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=209.68s)]
*  That risk became a reality. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=217.92s)]
*  Fed holdings had reached $9 trillion and inflation had hit a 40 year high. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=220.36s)]
*  As Americans well know, it remains painfully high. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=225.84s)]
*  Powell had to pivot again and tried to keep the Fed's Rate Setting Committee, or FOMC, voting together to get policy passed. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=229.12s)]
*  He began acting as a hawk to bring down inflation. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=238.24s)]
*  But everything that economists thought they knew about inflation in 2021 turned out to be pretty wrong. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=241.32000000000002s)]
*  It's not going to be, we don't think, smooth. It's probably going to be bumpy. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=247.95999999999998s)]
*  I think at a time like this, we're very fortunate to have somebody with the temperament of Jay Powell, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=252.04s)]
*  who listens to people, understands different points of view, distills the different pieces of information that come in to the Fed, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=257.08s)]
*  and makes considered judgments about what to do, and then goes and persuades people that may be on one extreme or the other extreme [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=266.08s)]
*  to come into the center and go along with the consensus. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=274.32s)]
*  Powell kept the hawks and doves united, with only one dissenting vote against rate raises since the end of 2021. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=279.64s)]
*  A lot of the people I talk to say that he's very good at taking people's concerns seriously, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  making them feel like they're being listened to, figuring out what a reasonable compromise position might be. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=292.96s)]
*  And that, I think, explains why he's been able to keep the committee so united during this pretty difficult stretch. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=299.76000000000005s)]
*  Everything we do is in service to our public mission. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=306.24s)]
*  We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=308.88000000000005s)]
*  As he confronts an uncertain economic landscape, his empirical mindset will continue to be tested. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  How we look back on Powell's tenure as chair really depends on what happens with inflation and the economy over the next two years. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=320.8s)]
*  How well did he handle this uncertain period? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  What did the economy look like in 2024 and 2025? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=334.0s)]
*  That history is yet to be written, and I think future historians of the Fed will judge him strongly on how that looks. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJf8HWzSyY&t=339.56s)]
