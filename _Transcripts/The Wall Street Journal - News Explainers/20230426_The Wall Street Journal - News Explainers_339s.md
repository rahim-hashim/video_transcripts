# How Tucker Carlson’s Vulgar Messages Helped Seal His Fox News Exit  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk)
*  Offensive messages Tucker Carlson sent showing contempt for Fox News management and colleagues were a major factor in the company's decision to oust him Monday, according to people familiar with the matter. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=0.0s)]
*  The move took Carlson off the air, a shock to the host and his large audience, making the previous Friday's show his last. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=12.52s)]
*  We'll be back on Monday. In the meantime, have the best weekend with the ones that you love and we'll see you then. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=20.2s)]
*  Culturally, it's a big deal because Tucker Carlson was one of the most well known TV personalities and the highest rated primetime host. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Here's a look at the private messages that led to Carlson's surprise ouster and what's next to the former host and the network. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=36.36s)]
*  Ahead of Fox's defamation trial against Dominion voting systems, people familiar with the matter say Fox News lawyers presented Carlson with what they thought was good news. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=44.28s)]
*  They told him the court would redact from a legal filing the time he called a senior Fox News executive the C word. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=54.24s)]
*  But Carlson wasn't impressed. He told his colleagues he wanted the world to know what he said about the executive. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=61.64s)]
*  Internal messages, many of which were from Tucker Carlson to other colleagues, were made public in the discovery process. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=68.16s)]
*  And some of those ended up being redacted. But in them, Mr. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=78.6s)]
*  Carlson made disparaging remarks about some of his colleagues and other people at the network. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=83.36s)]
*  The court filings also revealed an exchange where Carlson called for the firing of a Fox News reporter for fact checking Donald Trump's false claims about the 2020 election. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=89.44s)]
*  Please get her fired, Carlson wrote. It's measurably hurting the company. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  In another message, Carlson has shown complaining about the network's news coverage, including its decision to call Arizona for Joe Biden on election night. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=104.48s)]
*  According to one document, he wrote, we devote our lives to building an audience and they let Chris Wallace and Leland Vidert wreck it and included an obscenity. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  In the messages, Carlson also made disparaging comments about on air guests and former President Donald Trump. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=123.72s)]
*  He wrote in a January 2021 text message that he was very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights and that I hate him passionately. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=130.24s)]
*  Although many portions of the Dominion court documents are redacted, there was concern among Fox executives that if the redacted material were to become public, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  it would lead to further embarrassment for the network and the parent company. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  And on Monday, the network said it would part ways with the popular host. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=153.52s)]
*  Tucker found out about 10 minutes before it was announced by the company. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=157.52s)]
*  Fox News Media and Tucker Carlson have mutually agreed to part ways. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=163.56s)]
*  Carlson declined to comment on his departure. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=168.24s)]
*  Within Fox, people familiar with the matter said reservations had been mounting about risks Carlson presented for the network. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  Landing blue chip advertisers for his show was an issue. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=178.44s)]
*  Fox struggled with getting advertisers at 8 p.m. on Tucker's show partially because of controversial heat remarks he made on a number of different topics. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=181.84s)]
*  His commentary had grown more extreme and expanded beyond a conservative viewpoint on politics. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=190.96s)]
*  Female athletes are losing NCAA championships to men dressing up as women in order to cheat their way to victory. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  Democrats hate the police because they don't control the police. Very simple. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  So what is equity? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, tonight, finally, we know what it is. Equity, it turns out, is racism. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=210.36s)]
*  Carlson trafficked in what critics and even some higher ups within Fox felt was thinly veiled racism, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=214.24s)]
*  such as this recent show where he's talking about one of the Tennessee lawmakers protesting for stricter gun control. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=220.08s)]
*  Justin Pearson wasn't white. That's probably how we got into Bowdoin in the first place. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=226.4s)]
*  But he did a fantastic impression of it. What a nice young man. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  Has he considered the apprenticeship program at Citibank? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=233.44000000000003s)]
*  The former host is also a defendant in a separate lawsuit that was filed last month by Abby Grossberg, a former producer for Carlson. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=236.0s)]
*  I was hoping that it would be more professional and what he was portraying on air was just a show. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  And unfortunately, that wasn't the case. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=249.72s)]
*  The Abby Grossberg lawsuit against Fox and Tucker is also named as a defendant in that suit, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=251.32s)]
*  describes a culture of misogyny and religious discrimination at the network. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=258.72s)]
*  Carlson had no comment on the lawsuit. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=264.12s)]
*  Fox at the time said it hired independent outside counsel to investigate the concerns raised by Grossberg. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=266.64s)]
*  Fox and News Corp, the parent company of the Wall Street Journal's publisher, share common ownership. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=272.56s)]
*  Carlson, now off the air, has declined to comment on his future plans. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=277.8s)]
*  Some people have speculated that he might take on a career in politics. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=282.16s)]
*  Some people have talked about him launching his own media venture of some sort or joining another network. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=288.24s)]
*  But he hasn't commented on what he's going to do next. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=298.52s)]
*  For Fox News, his ouster leaves a primetime hole. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=302.24s)]
*  The network is currently relying on a rotation of hosts until it names a permanent anchor for the APM slot. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=305.44s)]
*  Historically, when anchors have left Fox, the network has survived. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  There are a number of examples of really prominent people who have left the network and launched their own careers. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=317.0s)]
*  Megyn Kelly, Bill O'Reilly, Glenn Beck. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=324.16s)]
*  But Fox nonetheless has found talent to replace them. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWHCHkI1bk&t=328.36s)]
