# Inside the Newly Legalized World of Election Betting  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o)
*  Americans can now legally gamble on elections, something once banned by federal regulators. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=0.0s)]
*  And while polls show former President Trump in a narrow lead over Vice President Harris [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=6.12s)]
*  in the final stretch of the election, multiple betting markets have Trump dominating Harris. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=10.72s)]
*  Supporters of prediction markets say that they provide another useful data point, besides [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=15.8s)]
*  opinion polls which have been proven to be flawed in some past election cycles. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=21.12s)]
*  Here's what this new world of political betting can tell us about the upcoming presidential [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=25.0s)]
*  election and why some critics are sounding the alarm on the implications of trading on [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=29.52s)]
*  the future of the country. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=34.32s)]
*  Election betting is now available to Americans thanks to a recent court ruling in a battle [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=36.68s)]
*  between betting platform Kalshi and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=40.84s)]
*  In early October, a federal appeals court legalized election betting. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=44.96s)]
*  The rulings have allowed a certain limited kind of election betting, which is election [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=48.68s)]
*  contracts on regulated exchanges. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  Americans can now place what are known as yes or no contracts on Kalshi and Forecast [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=59.48s)]
*  X, a platform run by interactive brokers. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=64.2s)]
*  Let's say that you want to bet on Kamala Harris winning the election. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=67.44s)]
*  You can buy contracts that will pay out if Kamala Harris wins the election. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=71.47999999999999s)]
*  Let's say that those are priced for 40 cents. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  What that means is that traders assess right now that there's a 40% chance of Kamala winning. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=81.08s)]
*  You could go and buy 100 of those contracts for $40. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=86.38s)]
*  After the election is resolved, if Kamala Harris is inaugurated president, you will [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  get $100. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=94.97999999999999s)]
*  If she is not inaugurated president, you will get zero. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=95.97999999999999s)]
*  On the crypto-based prediction market PolyMarket, which prohibits Americans from trading, bettors [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=99.78s)]
*  give Trump a more than 60% chance of winning. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  The gamblers are the ones that are the only ones that want to say it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=107.53999999999999s)]
*  Although prediction markets have a mixed record of forecasting election results, some users [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=110.89999999999999s)]
*  on PolyMarket recently made successful bets on President Biden dropping out of the race, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=115.16s)]
*  while the White House was still insisting he would stay in. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  I'm in this to complete the job I started. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  Just who is betting on the election isn't entirely clear. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=126.16s)]
*  We don't have a great visibility right now into who is trading on Kalshi or the offshore [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=129.56s)]
*  sites like PolyMarket. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  There is definitely a lot of retail interest. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=138.24s)]
*  There do seem to be a few very high volume, fairly profitable individual traders who have [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=140.28s)]
*  been using these platforms for a while now. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=144.96s)]
*  But what is clear is that gamblers are betting big. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=148.0s)]
*  Gambling on elections is PolyMarket's most popular offering, with more than $2.2 billion [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=151.3s)]
*  in trading volume on its main market for this year's presidential race. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  Supporters of prediction markets say they provide a useful data point besides opinion [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=160.84s)]
*  polls. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=165.28s)]
*  Betting markets also have the advantage of reacting in real time to events. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=167.16s)]
*  So if something happens in the news, say a candidate does poorly in a debate, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=171.38s)]
*  We had a thousand billionaires in the market. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  you will immediately see a reaction to that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  In a post on X, Elon Musk argued that betting markets are more accurate than polls because [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=182.5s)]
*  people are putting real money on the line. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=187.76s)]
*  Americans' faith in opinion polls took a big hit after 2016, when opinion polls generally [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=190.45999999999998s)]
*  forecast that Hillary Clinton would win the election. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=196.29999999999998s)]
*  And we began a new chapter tonight. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=199.66s)]
*  Instead, Donald Trump pulled a surprise. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=202.57999999999998s)]
*  They didn't do that good a job in 2020 either, when opinion polls predicted a giant blowout [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=205.29999999999998s)]
*  for Joe Biden, and in fact the race was a lot tighter than many people had expected. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=210.62s)]
*  And so I think that that has fueled a lot of interest in prediction markets now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=215.18s)]
*  But betting markets have a mixed track record when it comes to predicting election results. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=218.82s)]
*  In 2016, for example, betting markets saw Hillary as likely to win. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=223.26s)]
*  They were taking cues from the polls and they turned out to be wrong. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=229.06s)]
*  The betting markets were more favorable to Trump than the polls were in the 2020 election. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=232.5s)]
*  Critics of betting markets say that they have their biases. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=239.7s)]
*  For instance, you can have a few large whale accounts that do very big trades and push [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=242.82s)]
*  a market in a particular direction. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=249.1s)]
*  Another criticism that some people have raised of markets like Polymarket is that their users [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=251.22s)]
*  tend to be kind of pro-Trump crypto bros or libertarians. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=257.42s)]
*  Polymarket declined to comment. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=263.42s)]
*  In a statement, Cauchy said that the idea that markets are being manipulated on Cauchy [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=265.74s)]
*  is ill-founded. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=270.18s)]
*  It added that it was openly releasing internal data showing large traders actually slightly [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=271.3s)]
*  favor Harris. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=276.46s)]
*  And Interactive Brokers said that it doesn't have any evidence to refute or support claims [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=278.06s)]
*  of market manipulation. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=282.78s)]
*  The company also said that in a liquid market, big trades should balance each other out. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=284.34000000000003s)]
*  There is this idea that it's sort of inappropriate for a democracy. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=288.7s)]
*  It skews the incentives of voters. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=292.42s)]
*  I'm taking the floor tonight to ring the alarm bells for our democracy with grave concerns [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=295.5s)]
*  about the opening up of a casino for betting on our elections. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=301.62s)]
*  There's a related concern that it could actually be involved in some sort of election manipulation [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=307.02s)]
*  schemes. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=312.82s)]
*  Somebody who has knowledge of how an election is going to play out or revelations that will [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=314.14s)]
*  come out about a candidate could seek to profit from that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=319.46s)]
*  Despite the rise in popularity in 2024, it's unclear what will happen to these prediction [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=322.02s)]
*  markets after the election. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=327.74s)]
*  There have been prediction market startups before that have launched different marketplaces [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=329.53999999999996s)]
*  and they have gotten attention. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=333.34s)]
*  In general, they've done very well during U.S. presidential election years, but there [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=335.65999999999997s)]
*  tends to be a big drop off in interest afterwards. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=340.06s)]
*  So for all these guys, Kalshi, ForecastX, Polymarket, I think a big test will be to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=343.02s)]
*  see whether they can continue to maintain trading volume and interest even after we [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=349.46s)]
*  know who won the 2024 election. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufkwk8mWs9o&t=353.78s)]
