# Covid-19 Vaccines Are Comingâ€”So Are Hackers  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 23, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0)
*  Delivering millions of COVID-19 vaccines involves distribution centres, refrigerated trucks and cold storage facilities. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=0.0s)]
*  And each of these could be a target for hackers. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=8.0s)]
*  COVID has been just a golden opportunity for cybercriminals and they've taken full advantage of it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=11.0s)]
*  Since the start of the pandemic, there have been attempts to scam individuals and businesses for money, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=18.0s)]
*  as well as steal vaccine research or hold data ransom for a payment. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=23.0s)]
*  And a week before the first vaccinations in the world began in the UK, Interpol warned that criminal organisations were planning to infiltrate and disrupt the vaccine supply chain. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=27.0s)]
*  Hackers are looking for a way to tamper with the distribution, the cold chain network that enables the delivery of temperature-sensitive COVID-19 vaccines, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=36.0s)]
*  like the one developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, that has to be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=45.0s)]
*  The payoffs are really big. The people that are doing it are increasingly sophisticated. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=51.0s)]
*  So how are hackers targeting the vaccine rollout and is there a way to stop them? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=57.0s)]
*  Hackers have been honing their skills for years by going after hospitals. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=64.0s)]
*  The average hospital doesn't have very good cybersecurity. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=68.0s)]
*  Criminals are eager to take advantage of the concern that the virus has raised. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=72.0s)]
*  Jim Lewis leads a cyber security team at a Washington-based think tank. He says the easiest tool for hackers is phishing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=81.0s)]
*  You send an email out to 100 people, the odds are very good that two of them will click on it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=88.0s)]
*  What the COVID vaccine creates is the opportunity to do this on a massive scale. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=95.0s)]
*  And that means you can ask for a massive ransom. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=102.0s)]
*  If someone clicks on a malicious link or opens an attachment, the person may be prompted to download malware or enter login details, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=105.0s)]
*  giving the attacker access to the network and its data. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=113.0s)]
*  During the pandemic, Phish has set up bait with emails sent to hospitals about COVID-19 prevention and setting up pandemic funds. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=117.0s)]
*  And now that the vaccines are on their way, hackers are taking on new identities to infiltrate cold chain companies, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=125.0s)]
*  like ones that manufacture solar panels to power refrigerators or IT firms that support biotech and pharmaceutical clients. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=131.0s)]
*  I think the messages were very specifically crafted to get people at these companies to respond. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=139.0s)]
*  But in general, this whole problem of coronavirus being a lure for scammers is huge. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=147.0s)]
*  IBM recently tracked down a phishing campaign that targeted a variety of these companies. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=155.0s)]
*  The hacker was disguised as a project manager from the Chinese company Haya Biomedical, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=160.0s)]
*  which, his website says, is the world's only complete cold chain provider. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=165.0s)]
*  The writer said it would send an advance payment of around $220,000. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=169.0s)]
*  The message went on to ask that the reader review the attached draft contract, which is actually a malicious attachment. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=174.0s)]
*  IBM says it's unclear if any victims clicked on the file and fell for this scam and doesn't know which nation state might be behind it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=181.0s)]
*  If there were any victims, IBM says the harvested credentials could give the hacker insight into internal communications, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=190.0s)]
*  as well as methods and plans to distribute the COVID-19 vaccine. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=196.0s)]
*  Haya Biomedical says it condemns the perpetrators of the phishing email [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=200.0s)]
*  and is working with international organisations to ensure that these incidents don't deter the fight against the pandemic. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=204.0s)]
*  But if hackers do successfully access a system, they can encrypt the data, making it unreadable. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=210.0s)]
*  This can happen to logistics companies responsible for delivering the vaccine. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=216.0s)]
*  And so you could imagine locking up the supply chain, locking up distribution codes or locking the trucks and saying unless you pay, you won't be able to deliver. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=220.0s)]
*  But some systems in the cold chain would be harder to hack. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=231.0s)]
*  The actual operation of a refrigerator, that would be a specialised operating system and that would be configured in a way that was unusual. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=234.0s)]
*  So they'd have to figure out how they work. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=244.0s)]
*  So what's more likely to happen is that hackers will go after low-hanging fruit. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=246.0s)]
*  They're already making tons of money just hitting standard Windows operating machines. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=251.0s)]
*  So if you were working for a refrigeration company, I'd be worried about the sort of the back office equipment that the salespeople use, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=256.0s)]
*  the laptops and the desktops and maybe some of the servers. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=266.0s)]
*  After all, according to a survey by a healthcare IT consultant, 80% of health professionals say their hospitals still use legacy systems such as Windows 2008. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=272.0s)]
*  You need to do basic cyber hygiene, which includes training, two-factor authentication, making sure your patches and updates are installed. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=282.0s)]
*  But on top of that, you need to back up your data and think about how you're going to use cloud services. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=291.0s)]
*  But given the high stakes of getting more people vaccinated, no amount of drills may prepare the cold chain for the months to come. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=297.0s)]
*  This has changed from efforts to steal the formula, to efforts to blackmail people about distribution. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=304.0s)]
*  So we're seeing the cybercrime evolve when it comes to COVID. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGZxiJKIl0&t=313.0s)]
