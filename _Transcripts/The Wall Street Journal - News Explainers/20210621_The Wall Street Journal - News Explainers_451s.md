# Are Sale-Leasebacks a Good Idea? Some May Never Be Homeowners Again | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 21, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU)
*  The U.S. housing market is booming. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=0.0s)]
*  5.6 million single-family homes were sold last year. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=5.2s)]
*  That's more than at any time since the 2006 housing bubble, according to the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=8.52s)]
*  National Association of Realtors. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=12.48s)]
*  And more and more, the buyers are investors. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=14.8s)]
*  According to John Burns Real Estate Consulting, investors purchasing homes to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=17.76s)]
*  rent or flip currently make up about 20 percent of all U.S. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=21.76s)]
*  housing sales. During the pandemic, millions of homeowners have fallen [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=25.2s)]
*  behind on their mortgages, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=29.52s)]
*  And rental home investors are preparing for a potential windfall. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Some investors are finding homes through a growing niche known as sale [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=37.6s)]
*  lease backs. That's a transaction where a property owner sells a home and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=41.4s)]
*  then rents it back from the buyer. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=45.68s)]
*  Are programs like these offering an opportunity to homeowners or taking one [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=48.56s)]
*  away? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=52.44s)]
*  That's what I taught my kids to swim. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=55.68s)]
*  You know, it's just little things. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=56.76s)]
*  You know, my first big major purchase I ever made my life. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=59.4s)]
*  I don't really see myself living anywhere else. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  I'm really wanting to. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=65.84s)]
*  Blaine Marburger has lived in his home in Denison, Texas, outside of Dallas, for [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=68.52s)]
*  nearly 20 years. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=72.4s)]
*  He never expected he'd now be renting it from a New York real estate investment [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=74.0s)]
*  company. After the pandemic ravaged his finances, he found a company through an [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  Internet search that offered to buy his house for one hundred and eighty [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=84.0s)]
*  thousand dollars and rent it back to him for sixteen hundred a month with the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=87.28s)]
*  opportunity to repurchase it within a year or two. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=90.92s)]
*  Eventually, this was this was my option. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=94.92s)]
*  He raised his three kids here and imagined he'd stay in the house until he [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=99.04s)]
*  retired from his job as a physical therapist. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=102.72s)]
*  Then the pandemic hit. He says he lost half his income as he could no longer [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=105.68s)]
*  make home health visits. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=109.92s)]
*  I got a forbearance on the house, so I basically had a year that I didn't make a [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=112.12s)]
*  payment. During the same period, he also went through a divorce and started [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  paying child support. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=120.44s)]
*  I think honestly, if the pandemic didn't come, I could have made it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=121.92s)]
*  Marburger says he fell deeper into debt and his credit score plunged. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=128.56s)]
*  Even though he had temporary forbearance protection, which allowed him to skip [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=132.16s)]
*  payments for up to a year and make them up later, he worried he could lose the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  home. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=139.24s)]
*  I was very apprehensive about doing it, but it was kind of I was coming to the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=140.6s)]
*  end of my options, deciding what am I going to do? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=143.88s)]
*  The company Marburger found, EZ Knock, was originally conceived to allow [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=147.76s)]
*  homeowners to start cashing out their homes when the market was hot or when an [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=151.48s)]
*  expense arose. But during the pandemic, EZ Knock says it turned its focus on [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  distressed homeowners who needed access to quick cash to pay off debt. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=159.32s)]
*  Last summer, it raised twenty five million dollars from venture investors, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=163.6s)]
*  adding to the hundreds of millions of debt it had already raised, according [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=167.56s)]
*  to Crunchbase. In Texas alone, it's purchased more than 100 homes over the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=170.68s)]
*  past two years, according to public records. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=175.4s)]
*  We've grown in the triple digits in a percentage terms over the last year. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=178.84s)]
*  We've bought north of two hundred and twenty million dollars worth of homes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=184.16000000000003s)]
*  And our average home is pretty much in line with the national average, which [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  is around two hundred and eighty thousand dollars. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  EZ Knock has a new path to financial freedom. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=196.16s)]
*  CEO Jared Kessler says the company decided to focus on sale leasebacks to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=199.44s)]
*  offer homeowners with bad credit a way to take cash out of their house. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=204.0s)]
*  If people wonder if we're the lost and found and we're the destination of last [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=209.52s)]
*  resort, the answer is absolutely not. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=215.0s)]
*  People can sell their home. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  That's an easy solution for people. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=219.24s)]
*  If you want to stay in your home, you want the cash out and you want to be [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  treated with respect, we're the best choice. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=224.64s)]
*  For Marburger, the sale leaseback was both a last resort and a lifeline to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=228.83999999999997s)]
*  pay off his growing debt. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=233.2s)]
*  EZ Knock paid one hundred and eighty two thousand dollars for Marburger's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=235.64s)]
*  house, which it valued at three hundred and fifteen thousand dollars. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  That paid off his mortgage balance of one hundred and nineteen thousand [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=242.83999999999997s)]
*  dollars, including a roughly fifty eight thousand dollar lien from years [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  earlier and gave him thirty thousand dollars cash to pay off his debt. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  EZ Knock took a seven thousand eight hundred dollar processing fee and is [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=254.16s)]
*  collecting sixteen hundred dollars in monthly rent. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=257.56s)]
*  In twelve to sixteen months, Marburger has the option to buy back the house [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=260.32s)]
*  for one hundred and eighty seven thousand dollars. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=264.0s)]
*  The house was about four years away from being totally paid off before the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  pandemic. So it's like, I just needed four more years, man. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=272.56s)]
*  And but, you know, it doesn't always work out the way that you want it to. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=277.32s)]
*  Millions of Americans are in a similar situation as Marburger. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=281.32s)]
*  About two point two million homeowners are currently in forbearance, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=285.16s)]
*  according to the New York Federal Reserve Bank. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=288.24s)]
*  Serious mortgage delinquencies, those more than 90 days late, have [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=291.04s)]
*  quintupled since the start of the pandemic, according to mortgage data [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=294.68s)]
*  provider Black Knight. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=297.88s)]
*  Currently, federal and local pandemic restrictions on foreclosures are [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=299.68s)]
*  protecting some homeowners from being kicked out. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  But Ira Reingold, with the National Association of Consumer Advocates, is [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  worried about what happens when those protections run out. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=309.68s)]
*  He remembers seeing programs like sale leasebacks during the housing [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  crisis. As somebody who's done consumer protection for a long time, where [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=316.04s)]
*  people are harmed the most is when they're desperate, when they're scared [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=320.88s)]
*  and they're desperate and they're afraid of losing their home, losing [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=325.6s)]
*  something, right? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=330.0s)]
*  They're afraid of going into bankruptcy. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=331.12s)]
*  Reingold says he understands why sale leasebacks are appealing for [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=333.72s)]
*  struggling homeowners, but he thinks they're giving up too much for quick [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=337.28s)]
*  cash. And he says in his experience, rarely can distressed homeowners buy [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  their houses back. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=344.64s)]
*  I understand the short-term benefit of peace of mind, short-term benefit of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=346.32s)]
*  not worried about being homeless in a year. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=350.4s)]
*  But you're giving up your long-term stability. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  You're giving up all of the equity that you may have earned in your home [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  over these years. And if you want generational wealth, if it's something [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=359.79999999999995s)]
*  that you want your kids to have someday, or if it's a place that you [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=363.44s)]
*  want to live for the next 30 years, you're giving all of that up and you're [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=366.28s)]
*  selling it really low. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  Kessler says that at this point, about a quarter of EZ Knock customers [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=372.44s)]
*  have bought back their homes. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  Morgan Stanley analysts say they expect sale leasebacks to continue to [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=378.32s)]
*  grow because of the robust single-family rental market, especially for [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=382.0s)]
*  retirees looking to tap into their home equity. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=385.76s)]
*  They estimate there could be a million homes sold through sale leasebacks in [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  the next five to 10 years. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=392.67999999999995s)]
*  Invitation Homes, the country's largest home rental company, says it is [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=395.08s)]
*  planning a sale leaseback program in the fall as another channel to add to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=398.88s)]
*  its 80,000 homes, though it's in very early stages. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=402.8s)]
*  There's no straight lights. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=408.36s)]
*  It's just poles. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=409.32s)]
*  And, you know, unless you're really kind of looking for it, you'll drive [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=412.0s)]
*  by it and not even think twice. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=416.2s)]
*  At this point, Marburger says he has no regrets. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=419.88s)]
*  If you don't pay rent, they're going to come take your house. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=422.96s)]
*  It's not a nonprofit organization. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=425.68s)]
*  They're investors. They've got to make their money, too. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=427.52s)]
*  Just like all of us do. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=430.48s)]
*  But he's still optimistic that he'll be able to buy back his house at the end [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=432.6s)]
*  of his 16-month contract. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=436.12s)]
*  I guess, honestly, the best way to put it is I'm still hanging on to a lot [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=438.12s)]
*  of memories. I'm not really ready to give them up yet. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=441.36s)]
*  I'm not really start that chapter. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQeEJHVQqU&t=443.8s)]
