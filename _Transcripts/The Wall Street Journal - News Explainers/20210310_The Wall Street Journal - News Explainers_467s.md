# How Revlon Lost Its Luster  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 10, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M)
*  In this 1989 Revlon commercial, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=0.0s)]
*  the cosmetics company asked a question to its customers. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=2.62s)]
*  What makes a woman unforgettable? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=5.98s)]
*  A little luck in the right shade of red. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=7.92s)]
*  The answer to that question was, of course, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=10.56s)]
*  Revlon Cosmetics. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=12.96s)]
*  For much of the 20th century, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=14.8s)]
*  Revlon products were a mainstay in the makeup aisle, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=16.56s)]
*  once capturing a fifth of all department store [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=19.92s)]
*  cosmetic sales in the United States. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=22.36s)]
*  But in the 21st century, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=25.0s)]
*  Revlon has found itself battling declining market share [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=26.96s)]
*  and increasingly crowded shelf space. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=30.08s)]
*  Now with the company recently averting a bankruptcy filing, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=32.64s)]
*  questions remain if the once unforgettable brand [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=36.26s)]
*  is on its way to being forgotten. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  You know, when you look wonderful, you feel wonderful. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=47.32s)]
*  And the secret can be the makeup you use. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=50.8s)]
*  Revlon helped usher in the era of color cosmetics [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=53.28s)]
*  in the first half of the 20th century. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=56.4s)]
*  The company was founded in 1932 by Charles Revson, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=58.98s)]
*  along with his brother Joseph and chemist Charles Lockman. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=62.62s)]
*  It started by selling nail polish, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=66.06s)]
*  but quickly moved into lipsticks. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=67.89999999999999s)]
*  Sales of cosmetics surged between 1941 and 1946. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=70.22s)]
*  Revlon positioned itself to meet this demand, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=74.97999999999999s)]
*  claiming its products were seen on the fingertips [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=77.69999999999999s)]
*  and lips of the nation's smartest women. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=80.42s)]
*  Revlon is a brand that for decades, really, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=83.14s)]
*  for a generation was the biggest, most ubiquitous, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=86.64s)]
*  sought after kind of cutting edge brands. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=91.92s)]
*  And it was what you thought of when you thought of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=94.16s)]
*  mass market, yet very desirable makeup. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=96.48s)]
*  The cornerstones of Revlon's rise [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=99.72s)]
*  were mass production and mass marketing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=101.6s)]
*  It spent heavily on advertising, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=104.4s)]
*  sponsoring popular TV programs, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=106.36s)]
*  and pinning exclusive deals with beauty shop suppliers. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=108.18s)]
*  Charles Revson is said to have described Revlon's strategy [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=116.64s)]
*  like this, in the factory we make cosmetics, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=119.64s)]
*  in the store we sell hope. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=122.36s)]
*  Selling hope helped bolster the company's sales. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=124.6s)]
*  And in the 1960s and 70s, Revlon branched out, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=127.6s)]
*  expanding into pharmaceuticals and apparel. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=131.28s)]
*  In 1975, Charles Revson died, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=134.44s)]
*  and European businessman Michel Bergerac [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=136.8s)]
*  took the role of salesman. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=138.88s)]
*  He was a salesman for the company, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=140.6s)]
*  and he was a salesman for the company. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=142.4s)]
*  And European businessman Michel Bergerac took the helm. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=144.6s)]
*  A year later, Revlon sales reached nearly $1 billion. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=147.56s)]
*  Although it was still second in sales behind Avon products [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  with this door-to-door distribution. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=154.32s)]
*  The cosmetics conglomerate kept pace with changing trends [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=156.4s)]
*  as more women entered the workforce, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  marketing its products to on-the-go career-driven women. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=161.5s)]
*  Now the world belongs to Charlie by Revlon. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  But by the early 1980s, sales had flattened. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=169.26s)]
*  And in a decade marked by hostile takeovers, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=172.42s)]
*  one of the top corporate raiders had Revlon in his sights. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=174.94s)]
*  Businessman Ron Perlman initiated a hostile takeover [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=178.61999999999998s)]
*  of Revlon in 1985. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=181.66s)]
*  The takeover bid dominated headlines, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=183.94s)]
*  detailing the struggle between Perlman and Bergerac [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  for control of the company. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=189.06s)]
*  He said to me very proudly that he hunted lions and tigers, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=191.38s)]
*  so I was not a threat to him. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=197.7s)]
*  Ultimately, Perlman prevailed, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=200.45999999999998s)]
*  becoming chairman of Revlon's board [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=203.02s)]
*  and controlling shareholder. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=203.94s)]
*  Perlman enlisted famed fashion photographer Richard Avedon [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=206.4s)]
*  to shoot the unforgettable ad campaign, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=209.5s)]
*  bringing top supermodels like Christy Turlington [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=212.14s)]
*  and Cindy Crawford to be the faces of Revlon. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=214.66s)]
*  At first blush, Revlon appeared poised [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=217.76s)]
*  to end the century on a high note. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=219.74s)]
*  However, its finances were telling a different story. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=221.76s)]
*  Perlman had used junk bonds to finance the takeover. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=225.1s)]
*  It was assumed he would sell Revlon's non-beauty businesses [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=228.36s)]
*  to pay down this debt. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=231.22s)]
*  Instead, he turned his focus to a failed bid [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=232.82s)]
*  to take over Gillette. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=234.82s)]
*  And this came at a time when competition was heating up. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=236.02s)]
*  Procter & Gamble acquired several makeup brands, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=239.22s)]
*  snatching up a third of the cosmetics market by 1990, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=241.9s)]
*  compared to Revlon's share of just over 20%. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=245.3s)]
*  At the same time, Revlon was stretched thin. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=249.06s)]
*  It was carrying nine upscale product lines [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=251.5s)]
*  with nearly 3,000 individual products, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=253.66s)]
*  but women were wearing less and less makeup. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=256.34s)]
*  As they moved away from the bright colors of the 80s [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=258.9s)]
*  to more muted, natural looks. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=261.14s)]
*  The company launched its hit color-stayed [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=263.26s)]
*  non-transferrable lipstick in 1995 and went public in 1996. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=264.9s)]
*  However, much of Revlon's pre-tax profits [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=269.46s)]
*  were going to service its $1.3 billion of debt. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=272.3s)]
*  Late in the century, it turned into a company [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=276.18s)]
*  that was just a little bit behind the trends. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=278.26s)]
*  Things started, fashion started shifting away [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=281.14s)]
*  from these bright colors, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=283.26s)]
*  and Revlon didn't adapt to that change. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=284.65999999999997s)]
*  It didn't, it caught on somewhat late [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=288.14000000000004s)]
*  to the shift toward skincare and skin health, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=291.1s)]
*  and was still really selling kind of these, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=294.58000000000004s)]
*  you know, these color cosmetics that were changing. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=297.3s)]
*  By 2003, Revlon had experienced [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=300.78000000000003s)]
*  16 straight quarters of losses. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=302.98s)]
*  And by 2007, its share of the cosmetics market [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=305.58000000000004s)]
*  had fallen to 11% in mass market retailers. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=308.42s)]
*  Despite this, Perlman continued to keep the company afloat [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=312.46000000000004s)]
*  with injections of cash and a revolving door of CEOs. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=315.5s)]
*  Mr. Perlman, he said, and this was more than a decade ago [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=319.26s)]
*  in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=322.62s)]
*  he said, you know, for good or bad, I'm defined by Revlon. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=324.62s)]
*  He led rescues, he just bailed the company out [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=327.66s)]
*  over and over again as it continued to struggle. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=330.74s)]
*  Revlon tried to recapture part of the market [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=333.38s)]
*  with high-profile acquisitions of Colomer Group [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=335.62s)]
*  and Elizabeth Arden. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=338.1s)]
*  But by 2017, its market share had dwindled to around 6%. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=339.78s)]
*  By then, Revlon was not only facing stiff competition [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=344.58s)]
*  from the likes of Procter & Gamble and L'Oreal, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=347.41999999999996s)]
*  but from startups with serious star power. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=349.97999999999996s)]
*  Celebrity-backed makeup lines [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=353.02s)]
*  like Kylie Jenner's Kylie Cosmetics [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=354.58s)]
*  had burst onto the scene. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=356.65999999999997s)]
*  You know, company, whether it's Revlon, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=358.14s)]
*  whether it's CoverGirl, these are companies [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=359.53999999999996s)]
*  that have massive advertising budgets, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=361.14s)]
*  models, TV commercials, and, you know, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=363.82s)]
*  with the rise of social media, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=367.38s)]
*  we're seeing brands that are driven by, you know, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=368.78s)]
*  influencers, by, you know, Kylie Jenner, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=370.97999999999996s)]
*  who has, you know, a cosmetics company [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=373.66s)]
*  that has $200 million in annual sales, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=376.22s)]
*  even though, you know, there's only less than a dozen people [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=379.26000000000005s)]
*  who work at her company, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=381.74s)]
*  and she doesn't spend money on advertising [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=383.02000000000004s)]
*  because she just has so many Instagram followers. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=385.18s)]
*  In 2018, Pearlman provided Revlon [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=388.1s)]
*  with a financial lifeline [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=390.58000000000004s)]
*  and installed his daughter Debra as CEO, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=391.94000000000005s)]
*  the company's first female chief executive. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=394.82000000000005s)]
*  Through much of 2020, widespread closures and bankruptcies [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=397.74s)]
*  among retailers, salons, and spas, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=400.74s)]
*  crimped sales of beauty products. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=402.94s)]
*  The main thing is that our lips are covered [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=404.94s)]
*  when we wear masks, so lipstick sales have fallen off. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=407.54s)]
*  There used to be a term in the industry [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=411.58s)]
*  called the lipstick index, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=412.94s)]
*  and how much women were spending on makeup [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=414.62s)]
*  kind of as a proxy for the economy, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=416.42s)]
*  and he said, we can't really use the lipstick index anymore [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=418.42s)]
*  because nobody can see our lips. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=421.02s)]
*  The dip couldn't have come at a worse time for Revlon. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=423.98s)]
*  With a $343 million bond payment looming, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=426.58s)]
*  Revlon refinanced its debt to avoid bankruptcy. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=429.94s)]
*  If you look at kind of some of the analysts [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=433.09999999999997s)]
*  and some of the industry experts, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=434.97999999999996s)]
*  they question whether this deal to save Revlon [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=436.41999999999996s)]
*  has just kicked the can down the road. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=439.21999999999997s)]
*  Certainly, old brands, brands that are struggling [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=441.85999999999996s)]
*  have revived themselves before. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=445.65999999999997s)]
*  People would say Revlon has a tougher road, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=448.17999999999995s)]
*  and it's an entire company, not a brand, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=449.85999999999996s)]
*  but it's hard to say where they're gonna end up. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=452.73999999999995s)]
*  Where Revlon ends up will depend on how it adapts [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=455.17999999999995s)]
*  to the modern beauty landscape, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=457.78s)]
*  and if it can inject a little color [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=459.94s)]
*  into an otherwise bleak outlook. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbOkMuGj7M&t=461.46000000000004s)]
