# How the Oil Bust Could Reshape Global Markets  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U)
*  The coronavirus has emptied out cities. Fewer people are driving cars or boarding planes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=0.0s)]
*  Factories are idled. As a result, the world is burning less oil. But many of the world's [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  major oil producers have been pumping more than ever, leading to a crash in oil prices. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Low prices normally put cash in the pockets of drivers and fuel-burning businesses like [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=19.72s)]
*  airlines. But this is different. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  It's like low prices, but in today's environment where so many people are quarantined, people [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=27.2s)]
*  cannot benefit from low oil prices. So there's no winner in this current situation. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=31.6s)]
*  Analysts say that the current bust is so bad, it could radically reshape the oil market. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=38.4s)]
*  Here's how we got here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=43.08s)]
*  Oil producers' most pressing problem is that a lot of people don't need its products. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=46.44s)]
*  By April, the consumption of petroleum in the U.S. had fallen to the lowest levels in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=51.6s)]
*  at least 30 years. Demand for gasoline has declined by nearly half since mid-March. Jet [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=56.18s)]
*  fuel consumption plunged by more than 70% since then. The trend is similar around the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=62.940000000000005s)]
*  globe. It started in China, where the first of billions of people around the world began [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=68.38s)]
*  to shelter in place to slow the spread of the deadly virus. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=73.5s)]
*  For 2020, oil demand, oil consumption will decline. It increases every year, but it declines [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=77.14s)]
*  because of what's happening in China, what is happening in the global economy. This is [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=83.74s)]
*  one reason. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=87.78s)]
*  By late March, billions of people around the world were staying home. Analysts estimate [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  that global demand for crude oil will decline by about a third, or about 30 million barrels [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=94.14s)]
*  a day during the pandemic. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=98.82s)]
*  Meanwhile, oil is piling up with nowhere to go. Pipelines are filling. Refineries and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=101.14s)]
*  storage tanks like these are brimming. And some oil is being stashed at sea on ships. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  That's because the global pandemic arrived right as production around the world was [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=113.34s)]
*  surging. In recent years, the Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=117.02000000000001s)]
*  nations like Russia have coordinated production cuts and tended to prop up oil prices. They [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=122.66s)]
*  were working together to boy prices as U.S. producers flooded the market. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=127.98s)]
*  But the truce was short-lived. In early March, Russia and Saudi Arabia couldn't come to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=133.14000000000001s)]
*  terms on a new round of cuts. And Saudi Arabia turned on its taps. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=138.22s)]
*  Market turmoil is about more than just the virus. Oil prices suffered a historic collapse [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=143.3s)]
*  late Sunday after Saudi Arabia shocked the market by launching a price war against one-time [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=147.74s)]
*  ally Russia. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=153.7s)]
*  Meanwhile, U.S. producers continued to pump even as prices fell. U.S. production hit a [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=155.26s)]
*  record of 13.1 million barrels a day in late February and stayed around there through March. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=160.62s)]
*  U.S. companies were reluctant to slow down, having borrowed heavily in recent years to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=167.1s)]
*  drill wells, build pipelines, and maintain fleets of expensive machinery. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=171.38s)]
*  With billions of dollars of debt coming due, they couldn't afford to stop pumping. But [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=176.73999999999998s)]
*  by late March, already low oil prices had fallen by more than a half. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=181.14s)]
*  And the pain became unbearable. You can see it in this chart, which shows the number of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=187.54s)]
*  drilling rigs in Canada and the United States. The drilling recount declined as companies [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=191.94s)]
*  cut their budgets in mid-March. By April, U.S. production began declining. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=197.18s)]
*  In April, Saudi Arabia and Russia, where the governments are supported by oil sales, rekindled [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=202.26s)]
*  their market alliance. They convened a group of 23 oil-producing nations who agreed to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=206.9s)]
*  once again restrict output and support prices. They agreed to reduce their collective output [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=212.4s)]
*  by about 10 million barrels a day. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=217.86s)]
*  So far, the market has not been impressed. Goldman Sachs analysts called it a historic [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=220.78s)]
*  yet insufficient cut. Oil prices fell when trading opened the next day. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=225.86s)]
*  What's a really fascinating question for the energy industry, for the oil industry, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=231.06s)]
*  is will this dialogue between Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United States, and others, will [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=236.06s)]
*  endure beyond the immediate crisis? We could be entering a new era of international dialogue [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=241.54s)]
*  on the oil market of the likes we've never seen before. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2o7biBk9U&t=248.9s)]
