# What Facebook, Google and Others Can Learn From Microsoftâ€™s Antitrust Case | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 10, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A)
*  In the summer of 2019, the United States put Silicon Valley in its crosshairs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=0.0s)]
*  Only a very small number of the nearly 2 billion apps in the App Store are made by Apple. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=5.72s)]
*  We have rolled out many innovations over the course of the history of our product. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=10.52s)]
*  For every $3 of advertising spent online, a business would have to spend an equivalent of $5 offline to get equal prominence. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=15.4s)]
*  That is a tremendous savings for the U.S. economy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=24.0s)]
*  To some, these hearings recall another major antitrust case, a showdown between the Justice Department and Microsoft. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=26.759999999999998s)]
*  The year was 1998. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=34.96s)]
*  Microsoft controlled more than 90 percent of the PC operating systems market. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=37.08s)]
*  At the heart of the case was a new product, the Internet Explorer web browser. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  Prosecutors argued that Microsoft used its market power to stifle the growth of competing browsers. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=46.56s)]
*  At the time, many computer networks relied on software from Microsoft. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=53.16s)]
*  This gave the firm lots of power and influence. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=57.48s)]
*  Today, leaders from Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple are studying big cases like Microsoft to prepare for their scrutiny. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=61.08s)]
*  Here's what they could learn from watching Microsoft's case. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  Lesson number one, how not to counter an antitrust probe. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=73.24s)]
*  Ahead of the trial, the Justice Department deposed Microsoft's CEO, Bill Gates. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=77.76s)]
*  Mr. Gates, when did you first become concerned about the competitive threat that Netscape posed to Microsoft? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  Bill Gates behavior, his body language is contemptuous. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=96.28s)]
*  The product that didn't include Internet Explorer is called the Windows 95 upgrade. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=102.2s)]
*  Arrogant. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=107.32s)]
*  The full breadth of your question. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=108.72s)]
*  And evasive. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=110.63999999999999s)]
*  The Department just has played pieces of that video in its opening statement to the judge on the first day of the case. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=112.27999999999999s)]
*  And the judge later said, Microsoft, you lost me on day one. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=119.24s)]
*  Gates was deposed well after the government sounded an alarm over his company's behavior. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=125.28s)]
*  In 1995, Microsoft was served a court order for its anti-competitive activities and software licensing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=130.84s)]
*  Another case opened after the Department of Justice argued that Microsoft violated that court order. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=138.08s)]
*  The repeat violations in Gates's behavior did not play well with the judge presiding over the case. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=144.52s)]
*  After viewing the tape, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson expressed negative opinions of Gates and Microsoft to journalists. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=150.8s)]
*  In his decision, he called for Microsoft to be broken up. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=158.76s)]
*  But on appeal, a panel faulted the judge's conduct, as well as some of his conclusions. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=162.24s)]
*  It threw out parts of the ruling. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=167.64s)]
*  Microsoft narrowly escaped a breakup. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=169.4s)]
*  In the aftermath, the two sides agreed to settle with some changes to how the software maker did business. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=172.32s)]
*  According to Kavasic, the legend of the Gates tape haunts today's tech reps when they testify before Congress. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=178.4s)]
*  I think the approach that especially the tech leaders have been urged to take is humility. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=185.84s)]
*  What their inside and outside lawyers will tell them, because this is deadly serious. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=192.52s)]
*  And if you don't take this very seriously, you expose yourself, your company, everything you've done to real hazard. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=197.24s)]
*  And if you don't believe us, watch this one. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=205.24s)]
*  Precedent number two, free, doesn't always mean better for consumers. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=208.08s)]
*  At the heart of any antitrust investigation lies the standard of consumer harm. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=213.6s)]
*  Three key elements, price, quality, innovation that improves business performance over the long term for the benefit of consumers. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=218.84s)]
*  These three factors have been interpreted by the courts for decades. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=228.0s)]
*  In the modern era, courts have spent the most time grappling with the price dimension of harm. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  In Microsoft, Internet Explorer was bundled with Windows 98 at no charge, which meant that the case would require a different kind of analysis. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=238.96s)]
*  In the view of the courts, Microsoft made its browser free, but still abused its market power by favoring its products and shutting out rivals. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=247.88s)]
*  The government's theory was that those steps taken to forestall the emergence of an alternative to the Windows operating system was improper exclusion. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=256.76s)]
*  And for the most part, the district court and the court of appeals agreed. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=266.96s)]
*  Which means that companies can harm consumers even if the products they're offering are free. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=271.23999999999995s)]
*  That's important because in today's digital economy, free is in. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=276.68s)]
*  You don't pay money to use Google search, maps or translate, but you do pay something of value, access to your personal data. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=281.24s)]
*  Certainly in the modern tech environment, an important dimension of quality is what they do with your data. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  The treatment of privacy is a variable of quality that the consumer is increasingly concerned about. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=295.52s)]
*  Precedent number three, the U.S. government isn't the only test. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=302.32s)]
*  An array of state attorneys general submitted comments to the FTC on big tech antitrust violations. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=307.56s)]
*  They recommend that the department move its philosophy away from under enforcement. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=314.52s)]
*  Many from that group are expected to launch their own investigations. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=319.2s)]
*  Across the pond, the European Union already has fined Google eight billion euro. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=323.64000000000004s)]
*  European regulators also opened new investigations into Facebook and Amazon. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=329.0s)]
*  In its day, Microsoft also had to defend against a variety of challengers. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=334.52000000000004s)]
*  In 1998, 20 state attorneys general joined the Justice Department in suing the tech giant. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=339.52000000000004s)]
*  And in the 2000s, Europe's Antitrust Commission launched two investigations into Microsoft. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=345.88s)]
*  Those resulted in 1.6 billion euro in fines against the company. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=352.16s)]
*  I think one needs to put it into context. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=357.36s)]
*  Microsoft makes profits of about 1.5 billion dollars per month. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=359.8s)]
*  It's not all that large a fine. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=366.48s)]
*  Neither competitors nor consumers of Microsoft are out after fines. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=369.12s)]
*  Fines don't really do them any good. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=375.44000000000005s)]
*  It's competition that does them good. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=377.6s)]
*  But we'd rather have compliance and competition than fines. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=380.24s)]
*  According to Kavacic, the European Union has broader criteria on which to bring an antitrust case. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=385.24s)]
*  The EU's position in dealing with high tech companies, leading firms, has been much stronger than the US. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=391.6s)]
*  They arguably came out with a stronger remedy than the US did in their Microsoft case. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=398.12s)]
*  If you ask which jurisdiction plays the leading role in setting global standards [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  and influencing the way that other countries think about competition law, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=408.28000000000003s)]
*  it's unmistakably the European Commission. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=412.6s)]
*  All told, Microsoft's tangle with antitrust law stretched from 1995 to 2011. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=415.72s)]
*  In Silicon Valley, that's a lifetime. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  According to Kavacic, you can expect the tech companies to argue that a lot will change in their sector as the government attempts to make a case. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  One thing that the companies will argue is, let's take a count for a second of how we got here. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=432.72s)]
*  Where was Google in 1998? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=437.56s)]
*  Where was Facebook? Didn't exist. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=442.0s)]
*  That's years later. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=444.12s)]
*  Where was Amazon? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=445.91999999999996s)]
*  Another nascent enterprise with an interesting idea. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=447.2s)]
*  In the final years of Microsoft's case, the Windows operating system that Microsoft fought so hard to protect [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=451.32s)]
*  lost ground to the pantheon of web-based applications that we enjoy right now. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=457.91999999999996s)]
*  Today, the operating system commands only a 35% market share. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=463.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, Internet Explorer enjoyed a dominant share of the web browser market through 2012. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=467.88s)]
*  But eventually, a new browser, Google Chrome, overtook Explorer. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=473.67999999999995s)]
*  How the Justice Department presides over these investigations just might cause another shakeup for companies on charts like this. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frA5_sTj_8A&t=478.44s)]
