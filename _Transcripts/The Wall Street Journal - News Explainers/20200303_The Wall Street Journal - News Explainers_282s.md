# The Rise and Fall of the Boy Scouts | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8)
*  This is the 2019 World Scout Jamboree. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=0.0s)]
*  The event hosted thousands of young people [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=4.84s)]
*  from around the world at a scout camp in West Virginia [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=7.08s)]
*  and was sponsored by the Boy Scouts of America. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=10.32s)]
*  But scouts were meeting during a time of crisis [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  for the organization. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=16.32s)]
*  Total membership for the century-old Boy Scouts of America [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=17.88s)]
*  was on the decline, and one of its largest sponsors, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=20.8s)]
*  the Mormon Church, had announced it would cut ties [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  with the organization. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=27.12s)]
*  Now, a slew of lawsuits alleging child sexual abuse [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=29.32s)]
*  from decades ago has forced the Boy Scouts [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=32.8s)]
*  to file for bankruptcy. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=35.36s)]
*  Here's how the largest youth organization in the country [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=38.72s)]
*  filed for bankruptcy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=41.44s)]
*  So the scouts were founded in 1910, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=43.76s)]
*  and they were based on scouting programs [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=46.08s)]
*  that were already underway in the UK. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=49.0s)]
*  They really focused on civic engagement. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  They did this through a lot of outdoor programs [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=54.44s)]
*  and educational programs. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=56.32s)]
*  Really focused on raising young men to be upright citizens. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=58.08s)]
*  As the organization grew, so did the programs [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=62.88s)]
*  and opportunities the Boy Scouts offered. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=65.92s)]
*  In 1967, about six million boys were enrolled in Boy Scouts. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=68.36s)]
*  The Boy Scouts essentially became this pillar [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  of American society, and they formed a lot of relationships [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  with business groups, with civic groups. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=79.28s)]
*  A number of well-known American citizens joined, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=81.76s)]
*  including Neil Armstrong, businessmen like Sam Walton, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=85.2s)]
*  founder of Walmart, Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=88.44s)]
*  They really became this group that drew a lot of men [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=91.52s)]
*  that would go on to do big things [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=95.08s)]
*  in the world of politics and business. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=96.88s)]
*  While girls had been accepted into some scouting programs [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=99.36s)]
*  as early as 1969, the Boy Scouts prohibited girls [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=102.44s)]
*  and openly gay boys from joining the main scouting program. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=106.6s)]
*  So when we get to the start of the 21st century, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=110.36s)]
*  we started to have a lot of these membership controversies [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=113.32s)]
*  with the Scouts. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=116.52s)]
*  They wanted to be able to dictate who would be able [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  to come into the Scouts and who would be able [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  to be able to call themselves a Scout. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=121.88s)]
*  The group successfully defended its prohibition [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=123.83999999999999s)]
*  on gay members before the US Supreme Court in 2000. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  But membership started to decline as boys began [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  to look elsewhere for extracurricular activities. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  You had more sporting activities. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=136.44s)]
*  You also had parents that were more busy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=139.24s)]
*  There was really much more competition [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=141.2s)]
*  for the Boy Scouts to try and get folks to get involved. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=143.0s)]
*  The Boy Scouts leadership voted to allow gay youth [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=147.0s)]
*  to become Scouts in 2013 and to allow gay adults [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=150.0s)]
*  to serve as volunteers in 2015. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=154.16s)]
*  The group voted to allow transgender boys, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=157.36s)]
*  then to allow girls in 2017. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  Despite opening its membership to more kids, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  the Boy Scouts took a major hit at the end of 2019, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=166.44s)]
*  when the Mormon Church kept ties with the organization, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=170.32s)]
*  effectively withdrawing 400,000 boys from Scouting. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=173.4s)]
*  When the LDS Church announced [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=177.36s)]
*  that they were gonna be ending their partnership [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=178.8s)]
*  with the Boy Scouts, they didn't explicitly say [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=180.76s)]
*  that the changes the Scouts were making was the reason why, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=183.68s)]
*  but there was some tension there. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=187.48s)]
*  There has been a bit of a backlash [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=189.08s)]
*  from some conservative groups, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=190.8s)]
*  and there's been some new Scouting programs [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=192.24s)]
*  that have been started up since that has happened. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=194.88s)]
*  But for the Boy Scouts, a disastrous problem [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=198.08s)]
*  was beginning to bubble to the surface. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=200.36s)]
*  Beginning in 2019, more than a dozen states [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=203.52s)]
*  passed legislation that extended the statute [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  of limitations for child sexual abuse. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  As a result, multiple claims were filed across the country, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=212.52s)]
*  alleging former Scouts were sexually assaulted [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=216.0s)]
*  by Scout masters and other volunteers, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=218.4s)]
*  mostly in the 1960s and 70s. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  Between 2017 and 2019, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=224.4s)]
*  the Boy Scouts of America spent more than $150 million [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=227.32s)]
*  on settlements related to child sexual abuse. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=231.0s)]
*  The potential liability from other lawsuits [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=234.2s)]
*  forced the organization to declare bankruptcy [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=236.72s)]
*  in February 2020. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=239.6s)]
*  These are sex abuse claims. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  The vast majority of them occurred more than 30 years ago, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=243.16s)]
*  and the Boy Scouts have said [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=247.32s)]
*  that they put new child safety programs in place [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=248.72s)]
*  to make sure kids are safe, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=251.56s)]
*  but still it's gonna be tough for them to recruit [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=253.16s)]
*  at a time when their membership numbers are going down. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=255.32s)]
*  So there's still a lot of uncertainty [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=257.68s)]
*  for the Boy Scouts on the horizon. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=259.08s)]
*  You have these declining membership numbers, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=260.56s)]
*  you have this bankruptcy that's been looming, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=263.0s)]
*  and you've had this recent split with the LDS Church. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=265.36s)]
*  So it's really unclear what the future [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=268.32s)]
*  of the Boy Scouts holds. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv_clxpFs_8&t=270.96s)]
