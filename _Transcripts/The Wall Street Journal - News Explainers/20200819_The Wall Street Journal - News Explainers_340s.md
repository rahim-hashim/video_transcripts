# The Volatility of the Gold Market, Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 19, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U)
*  Over the past few months, the price of gold has been going haywire. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=0.0s)]
*  You can see it on this chart. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  As the coronavirus pandemic took hold in March, the price crashed alongside stocks, and then [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=7.48s)]
*  quickly regained. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=13.5s)]
*  Then a frenzy of investment drove up the price to all-time highs. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  On August 4th, it shot past $2,000 a troy ounce for the first time ever, before another [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=20.0s)]
*  week of big swings. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=25.94s)]
*  This volatility is drawing both Main Street and Wall Street investors seeking fast gains, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=28.08s)]
*  and leading some analysts to call it a modern-day gold rush. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=33.739999999999995s)]
*  But these big moves call into question gold's reputation as a safe haven asset. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=37.5s)]
*  Prices can move at a moment's notice without fundamental reason. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=43.16s)]
*  More volatility means more risk, and that means gold isn't the haven necessarily that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=46.92s)]
*  some people think it is. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=51.4s)]
*  To understand why the price of gold is so volatile, first you need to understand how [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=53.16s)]
*  gold trading works. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=57.62s)]
*  Like other precious metals, the price of gold is tied to physical assets. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=63.78s)]
*  The physical gold market involves mining, refining, travel, and sales. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=68.17999999999999s)]
*  Gold mining happens on every continent, except Antarctica. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=73.82s)]
*  In the top producing countries are China, Russia, and Australia. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=77.25999999999999s)]
*  This work adds up to about 2,500 to 3,000 metric tons of gold each year. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=82.34s)]
*  This metal is then smelted and refined before being turned into bars, coins, and other products [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=88.22s)]
*  like jewelry. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  The gold is then shipped around the world, often stashed in the cargo of commercial aircrafts. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=94.82000000000001s)]
*  Much of it is sent to London. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=100.94s)]
*  Mostly hidden beneath the streets of the city, the Bank of England's vaults hold around [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=103.06s)]
*  400,000 bars of gold, worth over $260 billion. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=108.06s)]
*  The physical trading of gold in London is done behind closed doors and in secret by [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=113.58s)]
*  a few banks. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=118.22s)]
*  So these banks work with the London Bullion Market Association to set the physical price [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=119.62s)]
*  of a troy ounce of gold, and that price determines how much gold is worth everywhere. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=124.34s)]
*  The gold stash in London is rivaled only by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=129.74s)]
*  holds the world's largest hoard of physical gold. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=134.24s)]
*  In other places around the world, gold is a common investment as well. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=137.3s)]
*  In a lot of cultures in Asia, people see gold as something that's having prestige and intrinsic [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  value that can be passed down from generation to generation. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=146.86s)]
*  That can be a big source of physical demand for jewelry and bars and coins. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=150.86s)]
*  When individual investors want to buy in, they generally have a few options. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=155.58s)]
*  They can purchase physical gold in person from dealers or on websites like APMEX. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=160.54000000000002s)]
*  They can bid on thousands of dollars worth of gold through eBay. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=166.01999999999998s)]
*  And they can buy exchange-traded funds that hold physical metal. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=169.94s)]
*  The biggest of these is SPDR Gold Shares, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  But this is just the physical market. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=180.38s)]
*  Gold is also traded on a whole different market that is tied to commodity futures. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=183.06s)]
*  This takes us back to New York, where gold futures trade on the ComEx division of the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=188.01999999999998s)]
*  New York Mercantile Exchange. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=192.33999999999997s)]
*  Futures are contracts which lock the price of a commodity that will change hands at a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=195.24s)]
*  specific future date. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=199.0s)]
*  A standard futures contract is tied to 100 ounces of gold, worth over $200,000, depending [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=201.24s)]
*  on the market. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=207.38s)]
*  The most actively traded month for gold futures right now is December, because that's a month [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=208.44s)]
*  people expect the pandemic's issues to maybe be resolved by. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=213.52s)]
*  And it's a month around November's presidential election. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=217.84s)]
*  A lot of people are very nervous about the outcome of that election and that it might [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=221.24s)]
*  be delayed. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=224.88s)]
*  So they're using these December gold futures to give themselves options and protect against [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=225.96s)]
*  market turmoil. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=230.42s)]
*  But gold has slipped lately after a long run-up, a reminder that momentum in this market can [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=231.82s)]
*  change quickly. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=237.29999999999998s)]
*  Still, this hasn't stopped gold bugs. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=238.68s)]
*  And there are a few reasons why people continue to pile money into the metal right now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=241.44s)]
*  For a lot of investors, it started in March, when mines, refineries, and airlines shut [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=245.82s)]
*  down across the world. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=250.88s)]
*  Upending the system usually used to move gold across the Atlantic and stabilize prices. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=252.8s)]
*  But when the pandemic hit, investors feared there wouldn't be a way to physically move [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  gold between the markets. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=263.12s)]
*  This caused physical gold purchases to soar, leading to a severe shortage that drove up [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=264.82s)]
*  the price of futures. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=270.36s)]
*  But there are other reasons, too. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=272.32s)]
*  There are a lot of people who are very bullish on gold and think it's an alternative currency [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=274.24s)]
*  that provides a hedge against inflation and is very attractive when interest rates are low. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=279.08s)]
*  Many bulls are piling into the sector because they think the Federal Reserve and other central [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  banks are eroding the value of paper money by pumping a ton of cash into the global financial [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  system to support the economy. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  The increased activity is contributing to momentum trading, driving a frenzy for gold [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=295.84s)]
*  similar to stocks. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=300.88s)]
*  But if inflation doesn't materialize, the momentum that gold is seeing could unravel. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=302.4s)]
*  Analysts say the current trading environment is extremely risky. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=307.64s)]
*  People say all of the economic and political instability could last for a lot longer than [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=311.2s)]
*  we think. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=316.2s)]
*  At the same time, if the economic recovery goes better than expected, if there's a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=317.2s)]
*  coronavirus vaccine more quickly than we think, gold could have some issues. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=320.48s)]
*  This means that gold could face more volatility moving forward. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpzs7IP51U&t=325.72s)]
