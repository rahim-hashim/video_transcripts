*  Jim Jordan is known for being a fiery attack dog in his committees. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=4.08s)]
*  I don't want you to answer my question. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=7.76s)]
*  The American people want Dr. Fauci to answer the question. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  And being a frequent voice on Fox News. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=11.92s)]
*  The left is, you know, their religion is climate change. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=14.4s)]
*  Steve Scalise, while he spends less time in the spotlight, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=17.36s)]
*  became a national figure after being shot practicing for the congressional baseball game in 2017. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Both Republican and Democrat reached out. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=25.92s)]
*  It really does show the warm side of Congress that very few people get to see. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=28.32s)]
*  And is popular in his party for his career in leadership, building consensus among members. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=33.6s)]
*  Here's how these two charted a course to the Speaker's race [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  and how they represent two different paths for the future of House Republicans. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=42.0s)]
*  Jordan actually got his first vote for Speaker back in 2013. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=46.96s)]
*  Jordan of Ohio. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=50.56s)]
*  It was more of a protest vote against then Speaker John Boehner, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=52.32s)]
*  as were the two votes he got again two years later. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=55.68s)]
*  Jordan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=58.32s)]
*  Jordan. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=59.12s)]
*  That year, the majority leader lost his election and Kevin McCarthy moved up from whip to the number two position. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=59.92s)]
*  And a new face joined the leadership, Scalise. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=66.08s)]
*  We're going to continue to move forward in the House as a united team. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=68.88s)]
*  At the same time, Jordan co-founded the anti-establishment House Freedom Caucus. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=72.24s)]
*  Made up of more conservative members of the House, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  angry Republican priorities were not making it into negotiations with the Democratic White House and Senate. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=79.44s)]
*  They ultimately pushed Boehner to resign that fall. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=85.44s)]
*  Well, are they unrealistic about what can be done in government? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=88.48s)]
*  That's the dysfunction. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=91.52s)]
*  Absolutely, they're unrealistic. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=92.32s)]
*  Jordan's caucus also blocked McCarthy from moving up, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=94.8s)]
*  electing Paul Ryan after forcing McCarthy to drop out. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=97.84s)]
*  I think I shocked some of you, huh? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=100.88s)]
*  And Jordan later challenged McCarthy for the role of leader. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=102.8s)]
*  He lost. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=105.92s)]
*  So when the Speakership opened up again, McCarthy moved up. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=107.28s)]
*  But not without some protest votes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=110.4s)]
*  Gates. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=112.32s)]
*  Jordan. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=113.36s)]
*  Jordan. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=114.72s)]
*  And Scalise moved up to leader. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=115.84s)]
*  As the majority leader, I really look forward to bringing those bills to the floor through a committee process that's open again. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=118.0s)]
*  But while their paths to the Speaker battle have differed, their backgrounds are remarkably similar. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=124.48s)]
*  They both represent their hometowns and win re-election easily. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=129.84s)]
*  They both started their political careers at the same time and around the same age, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=133.68s)]
*  as state representatives and eventually senators, before becoming congressmen, also around the same time. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=137.92s)]
*  Politically, they're both very conservative and both supported Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=144.72s)]
*  Do you think the election was stolen? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=150.32s)]
*  And it's not just irregular, it's states that did not follow the laws set, which the Constitution says they're supposed to follow. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=152.0s)]
*  80 million Americans, 80 million of our fellow citizens, Republicans and Democrats, have doubts about this election. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=158.16s)]
*  Although Jordan is much closer to Trump personally. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  There's so many weak Republicans and we have great ones. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=167.12s)]
*  Jim Jordan and some of these guys, they're out there fighting, the House guys are fighting. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=170.4s)]
*  January 6th wasn't Jordan's first brush with controversy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=174.96s)]
*  In 2018, former Ohio State University students from Jordan's time as an assistant wrestling coach, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=178.56s)]
*  claimed he knew about sexual abuse by the team doctor, but Jordan has denied this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=184.32s)]
*  While they have a lot in common, the primary difference between the two is in their beliefs of how to utilize their slim Republican majority in Congress. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=189.76s)]
*  Scalise is pitching himself as the one with the experience and personal relationships from his time in leadership to bring party members together. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=198.16000000000003s)]
*  I've got a long proven record as somebody who knows how to unify Republicans to fight on the battles that matter for the families who gave us this majority. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=205.68s)]
*  Although he's currently battling a blood cancer, he says is very treatable. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=212.56s)]
*  If the doctors didn't sign off, I wouldn't be doing this. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=216.24s)]
*  Jordan, however, is pitching himself as the person who could unite the more far-right members of the party, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  who are frustrated Republican priorities are again left out of negotiations. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=223.84s)]
*  I do think we have to have someone who can bring our team together. I think I'm best equipped to do that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=228.24s)]
*  So House Republicans will have to decide. Do they finally give the Rebel a try or stick with the established successor? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOKTu3WKJ1A&t=232.88s)]
