# Why Ford and GM Scaled Back in Europe  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 08, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo)
*  Take a look at this map. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=0.0s)]
*  It shows 23 plans that Ford has in Europe from the UK to Russia. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=4.36s)]
*  But recently, Ford laid out plans to cut six of these European factories. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=9.44s)]
*  So six of them, they're going to sell one, they're closing several, they're going to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=14.08s)]
*  lay off about 20 percent of their workforce there, which is about 12,000 people. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  But Ford is not the only U.S. automaker that's scaling back in Europe. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=23.2s)]
*  Two years ago, General Motors pulled out of the market almost entirely, selling their [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=27.44s)]
*  European brands to French carmaker Peugeot. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=32.22s)]
*  Both companies expanded to Europe decades ago as a wider strategy to scale globally. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=35.68s)]
*  But they both had trouble making money in the region. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  Let's take a look at these two charts. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=44.72s)]
*  This one shows Ford's operating costs in Europe over the past six years. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=46.92s)]
*  The gray is profits overall, and the red is profits in Europe. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  Now let's go to GM. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=56.28s)]
*  This chart shows GM's losses in Europe over the 20 years before they pulled out of the region. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=58.24s)]
*  So why has it been so hard for these two automakers to turn a profit in the European market? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=64.0s)]
*  So the first reason is that Europe's always been a really tough market. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=71.48s)]
*  Ford and GM have always been sort of middle of the pack there. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=75.56s)]
*  I mean, the real powerhouses are Volkswagen, Renault, Peugeot. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=78.32s)]
*  And when you're sort of a middling player in Europe, when you already have small profit [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=82.5s)]
*  margins, it just makes life a lot harder for the U.S. brands. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=86.54s)]
*  GM is making a decision to only compete in markets where they're the number one or number [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=89.9s)]
*  two operator. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=94.42s)]
*  And so they felt like they've lost money there for 20 years and they didn't want to continue [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=95.9s)]
*  to do that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=100.18s)]
*  And while GM has largely pulled away from Europe, Ford is looking to scale back and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=101.18s)]
*  shift focus. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=105.02s)]
*  What's behind this is a change in business strategy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=106.62s)]
*  They're selling fewer sort of passenger cars to individual buyers and they're focusing [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=108.86s)]
*  more on the commercial market where they're strong, which is cargo vans and trucks to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=112.76s)]
*  business buyers and governments. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=117.62s)]
*  Bigger vehicles generally equate to bigger margins. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=120.22s)]
*  There's less competition. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=123.5s)]
*  They're the number one commercial van automaker there. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=124.5s)]
*  So they already are more profitable in that space. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=128.6s)]
*  And they feel like if they focus on growing that, they could boost margins even more. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=132.12s)]
*  The second reason U.S. automakers are scaling back has to do with Europe's tight environmental [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=137.48s)]
*  rules. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=142.04s)]
*  Another big factor that GM talked about a lot when it pulled out was emission standards. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=143.04s)]
*  Europe has some of the most stringent in the world and they're only going to get tougher [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=147.16s)]
*  and that's going to cost a lot of money for the car companies to comply because they're [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=151.33999999999997s)]
*  going to have to invest in hybrids and battery electric cars. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  It's mostly battery technology, battery cells. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=159.88s)]
*  The costs have come down some, but most experts think we're still six, eight, ten years out [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=163.04s)]
*  from electric car being sort of unparity cost wise with a gas powered car. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=169.22s)]
*  The last major reason is that Ford and GM are gravitating back to their sweet spot SUVs [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=175.44s)]
*  and trucks. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=180.72s)]
*  I mean, these U.S. car companies are really good at making big SUVs and big pickup trucks. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=181.72s)]
*  I mean, Ford's the best selling truck in the U.S. is Ford's F-150. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=186.6s)]
*  It has been for years and years. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=190.68s)]
*  GM sells the Chevy Silverado and the Chevy Suburban. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=192.8s)]
*  These are huge vehicles that aren't sold in Europe. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=196.72s)]
*  The gas prices are too expensive. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=200.28s)]
*  The streets are narrower. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=203.12s)]
*  People don't have as many big garages like we do in the U.S. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=205.22s)]
*  And so, I mean, that's what Detroit has focused on. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  That's where they make virtually all their money. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=210.68s)]
*  And that's why they've never really been all that great at making small cars. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=212.96s)]
*  And the European brands have a big advantage over the U.S. brands there. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=216.68s)]
*  So they're playing to their strength. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=220.56s)]
*  Companies like GM and Ford, for decades they tried to build scale not only in Europe and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=222.4s)]
*  all around the world because it's a really capital intensive business and you need scale. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=227.28s)]
*  And now what you're seeing is they've got other needs to spend that capital elsewhere, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=231.72s)]
*  electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  So they realize it can't be all things to all people in all markets and they've got [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=237.4s)]
*  to pick their battles. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=241.12s)]
*  They've got to choose where they're going to spend their money. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN92O1zLhbo&t=242.12s)]
