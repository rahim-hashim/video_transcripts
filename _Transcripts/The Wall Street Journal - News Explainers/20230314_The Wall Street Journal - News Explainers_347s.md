# Why 2% Is the Fed’s Magic Inflation Number | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k)
*  For the Federal Reserve, controlling inflation is a little like playing a game of darts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=0.0s)]
*  Just scored differently. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=6.74s)]
*  It uses its tools to aim for that bullseye, which in this case is [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=8.620000000000001s)]
*  2%. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=12.58s)]
*  2% inflation target. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=13.58s)]
*  2% target. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=15.58s)]
*  And just like with darts, the Fed doesn't always hit the center. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=16.8s)]
*  The process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=20.78s)]
*  But even getting close can help keep inflation in check. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=25.3s)]
*  Here's how 2% became the Fed's bullseye, and why that number can help guide the health [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=29.5s)]
*  of the entire economy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=34.9s)]
*  So where did the Fed come up with this target in the first place? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=37.34s)]
*  The answer? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=41.38s)]
*  New Zealand. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=42.6s)]
*  Suffering from persistent inflation in the 1980s, the country's Reserve Bank initially [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  set an inflation target between 0 and 2%. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=48.96s)]
*  Central banks didn't use to tell people what they were doing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=52.82s)]
*  And in the 1990s, they began to experiment more with, hey, if we tell people what it [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=55.32s)]
*  is we're actually trying to do, then maybe it'll make it easier for us to achieve those [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=59.16s)]
*  goals. It's a strategy called anchoring. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=63.739999999999995s)]
*  When consumers and businesses know where inflation should run, it's easier for them to set [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=66.66s)]
*  prices and spend in a way that's consistent with that goal. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=71.92s)]
*  And that then helps the Fed set policies to maintain that level of inflation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=75.88s)]
*  Think of it as the bullseye at the center of the Fed's monetary policy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=80.64s)]
*  If you think prices are going to be higher in a year, you'll demand higher wages now. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=84.64s)]
*  So there can be a self-fulfilling element to inflation expectations. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=88.4s)]
*  Though targeting has been in the Fed's conversation for decades, the U.S. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=92.64s)]
*  only officially adopted inflation targeting in 2012 when the Fed was chaired by Ben [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=96.8s)]
*  Bernanke. Clearly communicating to the public this 2% goal for inflation over the longer [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=101.88s)]
*  run should help foster price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and will [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  enhance the committee's ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=112.06s)]
*  economic disturbances. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=116.56s)]
*  So what's so special about the number two? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=118.52s)]
*  There isn't a lot of empirical research that says we've analyzed all the different [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=121.8s)]
*  outcomes and 2% is the right number for these reasons. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=126.36s)]
*  That's really not how central bankers came up with 2%. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=129.0s)]
*  The idea was you wanted to have a level of inflation that was low enough that people [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=133.24s)]
*  wouldn't pay attention to how high prices were going up. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=138.04s)]
*  For the Fed, the number two achieves a few things. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=141.96s)]
*  For starters, it's not so low that the economy risks deflation, which is when prices [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  fall and can lead to lower wages and higher unemployment. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  The economy was at risk for deflation during the Great Recession between 2007 and 2009. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=155.32000000000002s)]
*  Falling prices for a central bank can actually be a worse state of affairs than rising prices [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=161.28s)]
*  because if people think prices are going to be lower tomorrow, they won't spend today. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=166.84s)]
*  And that can be very hard to get out of. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=170.84s)]
*  Lower inflation also reduces the Fed's ability to lower interest rates because rates [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=173.44s)]
*  tend to move together with inflation. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  If you have a 0% target, you'll probably have lower interest rates. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  And the concern would be you'd have less room to stimulate the economy when you go [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=185.28s)]
*  into a recession. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  But 2% is also thought of as not too high. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  High inflation can weaken consumers' spending power. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=194.84s)]
*  The concern would be that inflation might actually creep too high and then you'd get [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=197.96s)]
*  into a world of self-sustaining price increases where higher prices feed on [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=202.2s)]
*  themselves. And that's a cycle the Fed doesn't want to find itself in. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=207.23999999999998s)]
*  The Fed wants inflation to hit as close to 2% as it can over time to maintain a [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=211.2s)]
*  healthy economy. But sometimes it misses. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=216.56s)]
*  Through the 2010s, some economists were concerned that inflation was [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=220.2s)]
*  consistently running too low. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=224.16s)]
*  A new policy in 2020 called Flexible Average Inflation Targeting tries to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  account for some of those periods rather than always aiming for the bullseye. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=231.96s)]
*  The Fed tries to set policy to balance out periods of lower inflation with periods [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  of slightly higher inflation with the goal of averaging out at 2% over time. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  The worry was that the anchor on inflation expectations was actually drifting too [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  low. And so you could recenter it by saying, look, we really want to make sure [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=251.56s)]
*  people don't think 2% is a hard ceiling. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=256.52s)]
*  It's a target. If we're below it for a little while, we can be a [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=259.2s)]
*  little above it somewhat for a little while. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=261.84s)]
*  But not everyone agrees with the Fed's 2% target strategy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=265.28s)]
*  One concern is that monetary policy is imprecise. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=269.28s)]
*  You know, monetary policy is a blunt instrument. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=273.32s)]
*  This is more like going to see a barber than having a surgery. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=275.52s)]
*  Some also argue that a higher rate of inflation leaves more room for the Fed to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=279.52s)]
*  adjust interest rates to avoid a recession. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=283.79999999999995s)]
*  Whether or not inflation targeting is actually effective is difficult to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=287.12s)]
*  measure. Inflation did settle for a time after the policy was implemented in New [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=291.72s)]
*  Zealand in the 90s in conjunction with a number of other measures. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=296.48s)]
*  And it's still relatively new in the U.S. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=300.96s)]
*  As we've discovered, there are shocks that can hit the economy. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=303.92s)]
*  And, you know, it's difficult to judge in real time, I think, whether this is [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=307.44s)]
*  the right strategy. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=312.2s)]
*  Currently, the Fed reviews the framework of its monetary policy every five [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=313.8s)]
*  years. The idea that the Fed would make some kind of change to its inflation [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=317.84s)]
*  target in the next couple of years seems like a big stretch. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=322.16s)]
*  But they could debate at the margins are there different nuances that our [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=326.08s)]
*  formal strategy document hasn't captured? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=329.96s)]
*  And those are the sorts of things that you might expect to see in the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=332.48s)]
*  deliberations around any further review of the framework. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=335.96s)]
*  But for now, 2% remains the bullseye it will keep aiming for. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqY1bYEg1k&t=339.2s)]
