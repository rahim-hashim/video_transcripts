# How Boeing and Airbus Could Counter China’s Homegrown Comac Jets | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 14, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w)
*  This is Boeing's 737, and this is the Airbus A320. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=0.0s)]
*  They're by far the most popular passenger planes sold around the world, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=5.28s)]
*  with over a fifth of them flying in China, making it a key market. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  This is a continuation of a long-term strategy of Airbus in China. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  But these two rivals may soon have a new direct competitor, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=17.44s)]
*  the C919, made by Chinese state-owned aviation company Comac. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=20.64s)]
*  These planes are expected to enter into service later this year, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=25.28s)]
*  and state-owned airlines in China have already ordered or expressed interest in more than 1,000 of them. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=28.64s)]
*  Comac is owned and heavily subsidized by Beijing, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=34.72s)]
*  and that makes the company potentially the biggest challenge to a duopoly [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  that has dominated the market for over three decades. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=41.6s)]
*  The rise of China's aviation industry is one big reason why the US and the European Union [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=47.36s)]
*  have called a truce on a 17-year tariff fight over government subsidies. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=52.24s)]
*  Others are taking the opportunity to launch their own industries, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=56.48s)]
*  and we have been too busy fighting each other to pay attention. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  So how can Airbus and Boeing counter Comac? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=65.84s)]
*  Technology, their global reach, and growing political support could be some of the answers. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=68.64s)]
*  Boeing and Airbus have been rivals since the 1960s. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=75.52s)]
*  Back then, the European company was seen as an overly subsidized laggard, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  but after 1988, Airbus's A320 allowed it to knock Boeing off the top spot several times. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=82.72s)]
*  So facing new competition, Boeing nudged the US to start a legal fight in 2004, and then... [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=89.28s)]
*  The EU has today decided to take the United States to the World Trade Organization [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=95.12s)]
*  over the massive subsidies they give to Boeing. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=100.08s)]
*  It became the longest and most costly battle in the history of the World Trade Organization, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=103.52s)]
*  resulting in more than a billion dollars in tariffs. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=108.32s)]
*  Lately, Airbus has pulled ahead of Boeing in terms of orders. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=111.36s)]
*  That's also because Boeing has been dealing with a major crisis [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=114.56s)]
*  since the grounding of its 737 MAX planes after a string of crashes. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  All of us feel the immense gravity of these events across our company. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  The coronavirus pandemic has also hit both companies hard, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  with both delivering hundreds fewer planes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=130.08s)]
*  But there's one market that wasn't doing as badly, China. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  At one point, China became the world's largest aviation market, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=135.84s)]
*  as the US cancelled flights. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=140.0s)]
*  Now the US and Europe have decided to suspend their trade fight to work together and focus on China. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=143.6s)]
*  To confront the threat from China's ambitions to build an aircraft sector. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=148.96s)]
*  Airbus told us that Comac could take a share of the single-ail market by the end of the decade. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=153.76s)]
*  And in China, that direct competition is about to start. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=158.32s)]
*  Our country is also the largest aircraft market. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=161.6s)]
*  Since 2008, Comac alone has received between 49 and 72 billion dollars in government aid, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=167.68s)]
*  according to industry watchers, and has successfully built a regional plane, the ARJ-21. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=174.24s)]
*  The C919 has cost between 9 to 20 billion dollars to develop. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=180.48s)]
*  It's designed to directly compete with narrow-body planes like the 737 and the A320, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=185.12s)]
*  which can handle a range of short and medium haul routes. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  The Chinese aircraft is less fuel-efficient, has a shorter range, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  and lacks the global service network of the Western plane makers. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=197.76s)]
*  But China alone will need some 8600 planes over the next 20 years, according to Boeing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=201.44s)]
*  I believe their need for aircraft is significant. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  And Comac wants to provide many of those. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=211.2s)]
*  Orders for Western planes from Chinese airlines are much lower than what demand would suggest, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=214.24s)]
*  indicating that they may plan to buy the C919 instead. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=219.36s)]
*  China and Russia are now also developing the CR929, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  a long-haul wide-body aircraft that should start being built this year. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  So how could Airbus and Boeing counter Comac? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=233.68s)]
*  Well, first there is manufacturing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=236.48s)]
*  Boeing has been developing planes for over a century, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=239.28s)]
*  and relies on decades of experience and intellectual property to deploy the latest plane technology. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=242.0s)]
*  Comac is some 90 years younger than Boeing, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=247.36s)]
*  and its C919 has already faced production delays. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=250.24s)]
*  It will initially only be able to produce very few C919s each month. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=254.72s)]
*  Boeing and Airbus have also used their duopoly to create an international network of parts, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=259.68s)]
*  servicing and mechanics to ensure their planes can operate around the globe. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=264.64s)]
*  Even if Comac's planes become successful in China, they might be hard to export. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  And then there is concessions. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=273.36s)]
*  Airbus has already received around $13 billion in pandemic bailout support, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=275.2s)]
*  which it is partly investing into researching hydrogen planes. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=280.4s)]
*  One particular technology pathway which we find most promising is hydrogen. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=283.84s)]
*  Boeing and Airbus's new Fond Truce could help them pose legal challenges to Comac, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=289.76s)]
*  while still trying to extract concessions from their own governments to develop new, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=293.76s)]
*  cheaper and more fuel-efficient planes. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=297.44s)]
*  Finally, there is the fact that the C919 is built mostly on parts made by Western suppliers. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=300.16s)]
*  Engines are the hardest part of the plane to build, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=306.72s)]
*  and the C919 may still be a decade away from flying on Chinese-made propulsion. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=309.36s)]
*  For now, it uses engines made by General Electric and Safran. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=313.92s)]
*  The US and the EU don't want to hurt these companies, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=317.6s)]
*  but geopolitical tensions could eventually reach them too. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=320.24s)]
*  China has already caught up with the West in many industries, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  like trains, cars and digital technology, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=326.88s)]
*  so the C919 may be a stepping stone to posing a real challenge in aerospace as well. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=329.6s)]
*  After all, the country can potentially instruct its state-owned airlines to buy [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=334.32s)]
*  as many homemade planes as it desires. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoToFux20w&t=338.16s)]
