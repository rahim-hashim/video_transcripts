# What Are ESG Funds and Why Are They Under Scrutiny?
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 22, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE)
*  There's a big trend in investing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=0.0s)]
*  You can see it on this chart of inflows to ESG funds. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=3.48s)]
*  They peaked in 2020. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=7.12s)]
*  ESG funds say they judge companies on environmental, social, or corporate governance factors, and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=8.96s)]
*  they aim to attract investors looking for a more ethical approach. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=15.32s)]
*  ESG funds have been around for quite some time, especially in Europe, where the trend [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=18.56s)]
*  has really been sort of ahead of where we are in the US. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=22.96s)]
*  It wasn't until last year that we really saw an explosion of interest. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=26.24s)]
*  Many of these funds have recently outperformed the markets. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=31.52s)]
*  But regulators say they may not be all they claim to be. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=34.76s)]
*  We'll explain why. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=38.44s)]
*  The tension around ESG funds has to do with the way that they're built. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=42.44s)]
*  There are a few strategies, including exclusionary, single theme, and best in class. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=46.04s)]
*  Let's start with the exclusionary approach. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=51.92s)]
*  So when a portfolio manager takes an exclusionary approach to making an ESG fund, they'll basically [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=53.84s)]
*  decide what category of companies they don't want to have in their portfolio, no matter [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=59.92s)]
*  what. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=64.72s)]
*  A really common category for this is weapons manufacturers, for instance, or tobacco companies [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=65.72s)]
*  or casino operators. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=70.44s)]
*  Those types of companies are commonly totally excluded from ESG funds. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  Other ESG funds tie themselves to a single theme. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=77.44s)]
*  The index ticker, SHE, tracks gender diversity by including large companies with at least [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=80.72s)]
*  one woman in a key leadership role. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=85.6s)]
*  That includes companies you might recognize, like PayPal, Home Depot, and Netflix. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=88.28s)]
*  There are also ESG funds tied to solar energy and water, which promote sustainable use of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=93.76s)]
*  natural resources. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=98.8s)]
*  Funds like this can help an investor put money into companies that might improve society. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=100.84s)]
*  ESG funds can help an investor reach their moral goals, but the funds have also earned [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  solid financial returns in recent years. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=111.0s)]
*  A Wall Street Journal analysis of ESG equity funds found that nearly 150 of about 200 funds [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=114.04s)]
*  outperformed their benchmarks. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=120.44s)]
*  That's driven by tech stocks, which are commonly held by ESG funds. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=123.16s)]
*  More than half of these funds hold Microsoft. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=127.4s)]
*  Nearly half hold Alphabet. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=130.12s)]
*  In other words, ESG funds are betting big on tech. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=132.16s)]
*  But critics have questions about tech companies' inclusion. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=135.5s)]
*  Tech stocks are sort of an interesting problem when it comes to ESG because a lot of these [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=139.74s)]
*  companies do have relatively strong environmental practices. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=144.46s)]
*  By 2030, Microsoft will be carbon negative. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=148.42s)]
*  Not just across our direct emissions, but across our supply chain too. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=153.56s)]
*  But then on the other hand, they may have some serious problems when it comes to the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=158.46s)]
*  S component of ESG. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=162.02s)]
*  For instance, we have companies that have come under fire for their data privacy issues. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=164.14s)]
*  We have companies that have been criticized for the way they treat contractors and third-party workers. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=169.26s)]
*  But here's the catch. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=174.77999999999997s)]
*  A fund manager can just use looser criteria for which companies it includes in the ESG. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=175.77999999999997s)]
*  This makes it easier for more companies to qualify, even ones that seem counterintuitive [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=180.89999999999998s)]
*  to the overall mission. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=185.42s)]
*  One such approach is called best in class. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=187.73999999999998s)]
*  When we asked BlackRock last year how they were putting together ESG funds and still [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=191.86s)]
*  including major oil and gas producers, they said that they tend to take a best in class [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=196.18s)]
*  approach. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=201.06s)]
*  An oil company could still belong in an ESG fund if it's shown to have done better on [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=202.06s)]
*  ESG principles than its competitors within the same industry. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=207.38000000000002s)]
*  Using a best in class approach means that a company only needs to be better on ESG principles [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=211.46s)]
*  than their competitors. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=216.02s)]
*  But an investor doesn't always know how that fund is built. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  The problem is a lot of investors don't tend to read the fine print that comes with all [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=221.02s)]
*  of their funds when they're deciding what to put their money into. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=225.57999999999998s)]
*  They may just be attracted to a fund because they see the name of the ticker or the name [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=228.74s)]
*  of the fund itself and think, huh, that seems to align with my investing goals. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=233.06s)]
*  But when you look under the surface, you'll often see there are companies in these funds [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=237.66s)]
*  that don't seem to align with the stated goal of the fund. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=241.46s)]
*  And that really comes down to the fact that there's still no standard definition of ESG [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=245.38s)]
*  or what constitutes an ESG fund. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=249.86s)]
*  These details matter because they can change how the fund performs. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=253.02s)]
*  But critics say that they can also compromise the fund's stated mission for high ethical [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=256.3s)]
*  standards. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=260.42s)]
*  Recently, critics in the federal government have sounded the alarm on sustainable investments. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=261.42s)]
*  Here's SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce talking about how companies are assessed for ESG funds. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=266.82s)]
*  We see labeling based on incomplete information, public shaming and shunning wrapped in moral [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=272.2s)]
*  rhetoric, preached with cold hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences which ultimately [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=277.1s)]
*  fall on real people. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=282.38s)]
*  And it's not just the SEC. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=284.34000000000003s)]
*  The Labor Department proposed a rule this summer that would make it more difficult for [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=286.34000000000003s)]
*  401k holders to put their money in ESGs. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=289.98s)]
*  The department says the rule is needed to protect workers from investments that aren't [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=293.62s)]
*  in their best financial interest. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=297.26000000000005s)]
*  But pension fund managers and Democratic lawmakers say the Labor Department's proposal would [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=299.38s)]
*  undermine a tool of positive social change. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=304.02s)]
*  Regulators are still considering whether or not to change any rules. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=307.85999999999996s)]
*  Some lawyers and regulators think that there should be more standardization across ESGs [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=311.65999999999997s)]
*  to prevent investors from being misled. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=315.84s)]
*  And others say it's a step in the right direction to have Wall Street thinking about sustainability [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=318.28s)]
*  at all. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgiAIbTuRE&t=322.58s)]
