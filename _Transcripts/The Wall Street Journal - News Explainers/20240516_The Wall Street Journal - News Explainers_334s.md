# Why Gold Is Seeing Record High Demand Right Now | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q)
*  This chart shows the price of gold. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=0.0s)]
*  See these peaks? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=2.88s)]
*  They coincide with periods of economic weakness. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=4.36s)]
*  Recessions, low interest rates, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=7.46s)]
*  We decided to keep the target range for [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=11.4s)]
*  the federal funds rate at 0 to 1 fourth percent. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=13.16s)]
*  and falling stock markets. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=15.82s)]
*  The Dow just had its biggest point drop in history, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=17.36s)]
*  falling 1190 points. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=19.84s)]
*  But take a look at what's happening right now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=23.3s)]
*  Gold just hit a historic high. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=25.68s)]
*  But by most measures in the US, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=28.44s)]
*  the economy is doing pretty well. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  People say gold is crazy, what's this move? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=32.84s)]
*  People have called it curious, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=34.8s)]
*  they've called it stealth, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=36.0s)]
*  they've called it mysterious. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=37.24s)]
*  Here's what's driving this mysterious rally [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  and why new investors are taking the dive [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=42.2s)]
*  into gold. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Two of the main ways to invest in gold are ETFs, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=48.84s)]
*  essentially buying shares of gold [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=52.04s)]
*  and physical gold itself. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  In the past, investments have been split between the two. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=56.8s)]
*  ETFs are typically more accessible to the average person. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=60.12s)]
*  You can just buy them and sell them [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=63.48s)]
*  just like a share of a stock. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=64.84s)]
*  Unlike a gold bar, you don't have to store it [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  and then when you want to sell it again, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=68.6s)]
*  it's just a click of a button. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  But now, they're being sold off [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=71.6s)]
*  and physical gold is riding high [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=73.64s)]
*  as investors scoop up bars, coins and jewelry. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=76.0s)]
*  This rising interest in physical gold [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=79.44s)]
*  started with central banks piling up on gold bars. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=81.84s)]
*  They're taking dollars and selling dollars [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=85.48s)]
*  and buying physical gold and storing it [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=88.28s)]
*  because you can't get to my vault. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=91.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=93.0s)]
*  They're buying nearly doubled [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=94.0s)]
*  after the start of the Ukraine-Russia war [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=95.64s)]
*  as a way to diversify their assets. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  The US and some of its allies froze Russian assets [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=100.16s)]
*  and that's got some countries worried. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=103.44s)]
*  Countries like China, Turkey, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=105.12s)]
*  they don't want to see their central bank assets get frozen. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=107.12s)]
*  Some of these countries, China, for example, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  hold large amounts of dollar-based assets [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=112.92s)]
*  like US treasuries that the Fed would be able to freeze. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=115.2s)]
*  But gold isn't reliant on the US [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=119.0s)]
*  or any other country in the same way. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  If you took all the gold that was ever mined, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=124.04s)]
*  you could fit it into a building [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  that's about seven stories high and about 5,000 square feet. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=128.44s)]
*  That's it. There's no CEO of gold. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=132.56s)]
*  Nobody can manipulate it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=134.72s)]
*  It has its value just due to its own properties, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=136.12s)]
*  due to its own, you know, rarity. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=139.32s)]
*  And as central banks ramped up their buying, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=141.76s)]
*  so did individual investors, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  especially in countries like China. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  More retail investors bought gold there [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  than in any other country over the last four years. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=150.44s)]
*  Many are young, buying assets like gold beans. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=154.12s)]
*  Small gold balls that are cheaper than buying a full bar. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=157.32s)]
*  Younger generation in China, in the US, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=160.64s)]
*  and in other countries as well, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  has become more skeptical of traditional financial assets [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  and so they're grasping for something else. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=169.0s)]
*  And while China is the biggest buyer, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  demand for gold has increased globally. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  A Gallup poll in 2023 showed Americans [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  now prefer gold over stocks as an ideal long-term investment. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=180.44s)]
*  And one place to look at to see the growing interest? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=184.76s)]
*  Costco. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=188.04s)]
*  I filled out the merchandise pickup slip, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=189.0s)]
*  brought it to checkout, and then just waited anxiously [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=190.67999999999998s)]
*  until an employee brought it to me. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=193.0s)]
*  The company began selling gold bars online [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=194.92s)]
*  and in store in 2023. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=197.32s)]
*  Come look at this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  Oh, I'm getting that for sure. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=200.11999999999998s)]
*  And went viral on social media. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=201.84s)]
*  You can do the dragon one and you can do the moon one. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=204.44s)]
*  The bars consistently sell out [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=209.12s)]
*  and customers are spending an estimated [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  200 million on them per month. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=213.56s)]
*  People know Costco, they trust them, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=215.88s)]
*  and they were eager to buy gold, so they feel comfortable. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=217.96s)]
*  Costco is a small fraction of the gold buying [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=220.2s)]
*  and selling that's out there, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=225.04s)]
*  but it's revealing of the interest [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=226.52s)]
*  that regular people have. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=230.0s)]
*  All of this has caused gold to spin on its head, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=231.84s)]
*  bucking decades-long trends. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  Remember that gold price chart from earlier [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=237.36s)]
*  showing how it tends to go up during economic downturns? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=239.44s)]
*  People buy physical gold in those circumstances [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=242.60000000000002s)]
*  because they have something tangible [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  that they can hold onto. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=246.56s)]
*  It's not something that's just an image on a screen [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=248.08s)]
*  or a number on an account statement. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=251.0s)]
*  But some analysts say that right now, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=253.12s)]
*  people aren't necessarily worried about the current economy, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=255.68s)]
*  but about its future. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=259.2s)]
*  We had COVID in the pandemic. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=261.32s)]
*  We had the Ukraine, Russia invading Ukraine. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  We now have the Middle East war. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=266.32s)]
*  We have ballooning government debt. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=268.52s)]
*  And on top of that, just political discord, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=270.2s)]
*  international discord. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=272.96s)]
*  It's just a very turbulent, uncertain time. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=274.84s)]
*  And just because the economy is doing well in some places [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=277.8s)]
*  doesn't mean it's doing well everywhere. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=281.32s)]
*  For Chinese investors, the interest in gold [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=283.68s)]
*  has been driven by a recent stock market crash [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  and turmoil in the housing market. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=288.6s)]
*  Traditionally, Chinese, just like here, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=290.56s)]
*  bought property to store their wealth. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=292.64s)]
*  Since the real estate market there collapsed, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=295.76s)]
*  gold has become an alternative, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  a hard asset that people can own to store value. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=300.6s)]
*  So what does all of this mean for investors? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=304.64s)]
*  Well, gold can still go up or down at any time, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=307.4s)]
*  especially because it's often driven by emotion. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=310.96s)]
*  But some analysts are bullish on its value [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=314.28s)]
*  continuing to stay high. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=316.88s)]
*  The underlying things that are causing worry [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  and driving people to gold, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=321.08s)]
*  those don't seem to be going away anytime soon. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  So by and large, the street is bullish. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYu-xnjwN4Q&t=324.84000000000003s)]
