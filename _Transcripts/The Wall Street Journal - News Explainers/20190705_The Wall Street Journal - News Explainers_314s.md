# Why Gas Prices Vary From Pump to Pump  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 05, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0)
*  We've all seen it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=0.0s)]
*  Two gas stations on the same street, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=2.12s)]
*  selling the same product, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=4.92s)]
*  but at different prices. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Variety in gas prices can dictate [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=11.36s)]
*  a commuter's route to work or [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=14.36s)]
*  impact the cost of a family summer vacation. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=16.0s)]
*  Americans are keenly aware of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=18.72s)]
*  the impact gas prices can have on their lives. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=21.12s)]
*  But all drivers have probably wondered at some point, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=24.48s)]
*  why do gas prices vary so much from [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=27.64s)]
*  state to state, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=29.72s)]
*  town to town, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=31.08s)]
*  and sometimes even block to block? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=32.28s)]
*  Overall, gas prices are dictated by [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  a combination of global, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=38.12s)]
*  national, and local economic forces. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=39.48s)]
*  They vary depending on how those forces add up. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=42.32s)]
*  We'll explain. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=46.32s)]
*  Here's a breakdown of where your money goes at the pump. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=48.76s)]
*  The biggest factor that impacts gas prices [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=52.72s)]
*  is the one you probably expect, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=55.08s)]
*  the price of crude oil. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=57.48s)]
*  This doesn't explain price differences from pump to pump, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=60.31999999999999s)]
*  but it does explain why the price of a gallon of gas [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=62.8s)]
*  can fluctuate from day to day. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=65.32s)]
*  Changes in gas prices follow changes in oil prices. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=67.36s)]
*  Oil prices fluctuate for a variety of reasons. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=72.32s)]
*  First, they depend on the output from oil producing countries, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=75.4s)]
*  like the top one shown here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=78.52s)]
*  If a major oil producer like Saudi Arabia cuts production, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=81.0s)]
*  the price could rise. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=84.16s)]
*  In fact, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=85.72000000000001s)]
*  or OPEC, sometimes does this on purpose, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  to raise the price of crude oil. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=91.04s)]
*  Other factors that affect the cost of crude oil [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  include speculation in financial markets, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=95.72000000000001s)]
*  the amount of stockpiled oil reserves, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=98.28s)]
*  geopolitical and weather events, and demand. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=100.56s)]
*  The United States has the highest demand [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=104.0s)]
*  for crude oil in the world, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=105.68s)]
*  consuming 19.6 million barrels per day. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=107.4s)]
*  This demand is seasonal. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=110.72s)]
*  U.S. oil demand increases over the first half of the year [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  and peaks in summer months as travel increases. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  Summer travel often involves crossing state lines, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  and gas prices can vary substantially from state to state. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=122.84s)]
*  Those differences mostly have to do with state taxes [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=126.64s)]
*  and refining methods. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=129.08s)]
*  There's a federal excise tax that everyone pays, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=131.88s)]
*  but each state also levies their own gas tax. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=134.6s)]
*  Pennsylvania drivers pay over 77 cents per gallon in taxes, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=137.84s)]
*  the nation's highest, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=141.84s)]
*  while drivers in Alaska pay the lowest in taxes [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=143.04s)]
*  at just over 32 cents per gallon. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=145.56s)]
*  Some of these taxes go to state departments [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=148.4s)]
*  of transportation, and over the past decade, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=150.32s)]
*  more than two dozen states have increased their tax rates [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=152.4s)]
*  to fund infrastructure projects. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  Beyond taxes, fuel additives and refining processes [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=157.72s)]
*  create price differences between states. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=160.36s)]
*  Most of the fuel sold in the U.S. is 10% ethanol. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=162.72s)]
*  Coastal states may see a two to three cent gas price increase [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  to cover the transportation costs [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=170.16s)]
*  to ship the additive from the nation's corn belt. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  Some states are also required by law [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=175.24s)]
*  to use special reformulated gasoline [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=177.0s)]
*  that reduces air pollution. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=179.2s)]
*  It's currently used in 18 states [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=180.88s)]
*  and makes up about 30% of the fuel sold in the U.S. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=182.72s)]
*  Reformulated gasoline was almost 30 cents more on average [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=187.88s)]
*  than conventional gas in 2018. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  California has one of the highest gas taxes [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=195.16s)]
*  and most stringent reformulated gas programs [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=197.44s)]
*  in the country, leading to prices consistently [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=199.8s)]
*  above the national average. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  Also, very few facilities outside of the state [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=205.56s)]
*  are equipped to refine its specialized fuel. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  When two of the state's 13 reformulated gas refineries [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  experienced outages in 2015, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  fuel had to be imported from overseas, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=216.68s)]
*  driving up the price. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=219.08s)]
*  But what about that few cents difference [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=221.28s)]
*  between neighboring gas stations? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=223.16000000000003s)]
*  That often comes down to marketing decisions [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=225.44s)]
*  made by station owners. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  The majority of gas stations in the United States [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=229.8s)]
*  are privately owned businesses. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=232.16000000000003s)]
*  Station owners negotiate contracts with fuel suppliers [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=234.32000000000002s)]
*  that cover shipment frequency, volume, and branding. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=237.08s)]
*  Disruptions up the supply chain, like a refinery shutdown, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  can impact stations differently [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  depending on the terms of their contract, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=245.52s)]
*  which can lead to different prices at different locations. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=247.96s)]
*  But also profit margins on gas are low [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=252.08s)]
*  compared to other goods sold at gas stations, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=254.56s)]
*  like food and drinks. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=257.0s)]
*  After expenses, a station will take in an average [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=258.44s)]
*  of 10 to 15 cents for every gallon of gas sold, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=260.88s)]
*  according to an industry trade group. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=264.92s)]
*  Fuel accounts for a majority of sales at gas stations, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=267.48s)]
*  but only about a third of profits. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=270.76s)]
*  Station owners make most of their money [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=273.36s)]
*  from in-store purchases. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  In a recent industry survey, over half of drivers [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=278.04s)]
*  said that the gas price is the biggest factor [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=281.0s)]
*  when deciding where to fill up. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=283.24s)]
*  A slightly lower gas price can increase [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=285.44s)]
*  customer traffic to a store, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=287.44s)]
*  creating more opportunities for owners [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=289.48s)]
*  to sell those higher margin in-store items. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=291.12s)]
*  The cost of a gallon of gas at any time [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=295.44s)]
*  is a reflection of multiple economic forces, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=297.64s)]
*  both large and small. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=300.28s)]
*  But gas stations will always try to find a way [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=302.24s)]
*  to get drivers to go that extra mile. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn_UU72CR0&t=304.68s)]
