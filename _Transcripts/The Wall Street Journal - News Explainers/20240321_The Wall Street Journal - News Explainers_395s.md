# Neuralink's Rival Tests Brain Chip in Race to Bring Implants to Market | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q)
*  So we're going to start the experiment, OK? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=0.0s)]
*  That experiment you're seeing now [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=2.64s)]
*  is something only a handful of people have experienced. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=5.0s)]
*  Having a microchip read your mind from inside your head. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=8.76s)]
*  It's part of a growing industry that includes [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=13.16s)]
*  Elon Musk's Neuralink, which says it just implanted [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=15.92s)]
*  its first chip into a human brain. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=19.6s)]
*  But other devices have already proven [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=22.32s)]
*  to telepathically control computers [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=24.28s)]
*  and wirelessly operate prosthetics. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=26.48s)]
*  It's a fundamentally different class of medical device [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=29.2s)]
*  than anything we've ever seen before. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=31.96s)]
*  Here's an inside look at how two of the implants [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=33.56s)]
*  challenging Neuralink work, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=36.0s)]
*  and what it will take to get them to consumers. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=38.04s)]
*  Elon Musk is the kind of person who has very, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=41.44s)]
*  very expansive visions of the future. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=47.32s)]
*  His idea is we're actually going to augment [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  perfectly healthy humans with this chip [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=53.04s)]
*  so that we can go along for the ride with AI as it advances. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=55.24s)]
*  It's going to be important for us to figure out [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=58.8s)]
*  how we coexist with advanced artificial intelligence. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  While Elon Musk's end goal for Neuralink is wider reaching, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=64.8s)]
*  it's starting with addressing a specific medical condition, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=68.56s)]
*  which other leading implantable BCIs, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=72.0s)]
*  or brain-computer interfaces, are also aiming to treat. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=74.92s)]
*  The technology is for people [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=79.08s)]
*  who can no longer use their smartphones. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=80.36s)]
*  It's people whose hands don't work. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=83.0s)]
*  So it's things like stroke, ALS, muscular dystrophy, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  multiple sclerosis, severe arthritis, cerebral palsy. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=88.4s)]
*  These implants, right now, don't cure these issues. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=93.12s)]
*  But they could allow someone who has lost use of their hands [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=97.12s)]
*  to say, move a computer mouse, just by thinking. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=100.0s)]
*  Our patients describe feeling a little bit [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=103.4s)]
*  like they're locked in their own body, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=105.04s)]
*  their brain still working, and they want to do things, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  but you depend on other people to engage. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  So it sort of gets to, like, a restoration of agency autonomy. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  Tom Oxley is the CEO of Synchron, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=115.64000000000001s)]
*  one of the five leading BCIs [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=118.28s)]
*  that are competing in the industry. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  While they vary in several ways, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  there's one major difference that sets them apart. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=124.28s)]
*  Invasiveness, or how deeply implanted they are in the brain. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=127.16s)]
*  Where neurotechnology has been developing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=131.68s)]
*  is to try to make devices that are less invasive, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=134.88s)]
*  but also devices that work better. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=139.0s)]
*  Devices that can get more information in and out, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=141.04s)]
*  devices that can target specific regions of the brain. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=143.28s)]
*  Neuralynx device and others like it [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=146.32s)]
*  have to be implanted directly into or onto the brain [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=148.64s)]
*  in order to gather more data. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=152.16s)]
*  Synchron, on the other hand, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=154.12s)]
*  is a stent that is implanted into a blood vessel [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  in the surface of the brain. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=158.6s)]
*  It's less risky than brain surgery, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  but the placement can affect [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=162.56s)]
*  what information the implant gets from the brain. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=164.32s)]
*  You know, there's a whole bunch of different ideas [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=166.76s)]
*  for what's gonna give you the best brain signal readings [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=168.32s)]
*  and, you know, from that data. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=172.32s)]
*  Can we do more? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=173.76s)]
*  But then there's a trade-off with invasiveness. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=174.72s)]
*  And so you have all these companies [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=176.76s)]
*  doing slightly different things, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=178.04s)]
*  hoping to come up with sort of the best recipe. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=180.48s)]
*  Here's how Synchron's device works. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=183.44s)]
*  So I have a stentrode here, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=185.76s)]
*  which is the electrode array that goes into the brain. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=187.32s)]
*  So I'll just bring it out of the catheter. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=190.52s)]
*  So you can see it opened up outside of the catheter here. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=192.2s)]
*  So we should see it coming up in a minute. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=196.24s)]
*  If you look down here, you'll see something coming up [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=198.88s)]
*  inside the brain now. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=201.2s)]
*  That stentrode, as Synchron calls their device, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=202.96s)]
*  is a number of electrodes that pick up electrical signals [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  that correspond with specific thoughts. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=208.72s)]
*  Those signals run down into this chip, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=211.24s)]
*  which is implanted in the chest. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=213.32s)]
*  It wirelessly sends the signals to a computer [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=215.36s)]
*  that transforms them into a digital command, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=218.12s)]
*  like a mouse click. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=220.56s)]
*  So where your brain previously made your hand move, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=221.96s)]
*  like mine is doing right now, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=225.16s)]
*  it now is pushing a cursor to do navigate and click [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  on a screen. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=229.88s)]
*  Synchron has successfully put permanent implants [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=231.0s)]
*  in 10 patients so far as part of its clinical trials. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=233.48s)]
*  Sometimes you can feel it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=237.48s)]
*  Same as a pacemaker. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=239.0s)]
*  Precision, whose implant you saw in the surgery earlier, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=240.48s)]
*  is testing a temporary version of its device. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=243.8s)]
*  The company is using volunteers [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=246.88s)]
*  who are already scheduled for other brain operations [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=248.48s)]
*  to implant its electrode array to collect data [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=251.32s)]
*  and then remove it at the end of the surgery. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=254.0s)]
*  Right now, the device is recording brain activity [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=256.32s)]
*  as the patient goes through the motions [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=259.12s)]
*  of rock-paper-scissors. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=260.76s)]
*  Patients in this study are wearing a glove on each hand [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=262.48s)]
*  that allows us to track the movement of the hand [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=266.24s)]
*  in real time with a very, very high sensitivity [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  so that we know exactly what each finger is doing [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=272.2s)]
*  and where the fingers in the hand and the arm are in space. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=274.24s)]
*  And we can correlate that with the electrical activity [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=277.08s)]
*  that is happening on the motor cortex just before [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=279.6s)]
*  and during and after the execution of a movement. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=282.08s)]
*  That data is projected onto this grid, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  which is like a map of the brain. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=287.76s)]
*  These red areas are where more activity is happening [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=289.96s)]
*  with each action. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=292.8s)]
*  This helps researchers understand [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=294.48s)]
*  how the brain activates different movements, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  and they can later use that data [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=298.64s)]
*  to help paralyzed patients control a computer [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=300.2s)]
*  with their minds, for example. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=302.56s)]
*  We can predict what's about to happen [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=304.32s)]
*  even before the patient speaks or moves. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=306.4s)]
*  In terms of invasiveness, Precision's electrode array [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=308.84s)]
*  is meant to slide in through a slit in the skull [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=312.0s)]
*  to sit just on top of the brain. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  In order to make it to market, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=317.0s)]
*  these devices will have to prove to the FDA [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=318.68s)]
*  that they're both safe and worth the risk, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=321.2s)]
*  and then they'll still need to get buy-in [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=323.8s)]
*  from other players throughout the industry. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=325.8s)]
*  We have to think about the insurance providers. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=328.36s)]
*  We have to think about the hospitals. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=330.08s)]
*  We have to think about the physicians [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=331.36s)]
*  who are prescribing the devices. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=332.68s)]
*  All of these people have to get together and agree [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=334.72s)]
*  that this is the best path forward [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=336.88s)]
*  is something that they want, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=338.36s)]
*  and they recognize the benefit of it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=339.2s)]
*  That process could take years, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=340.52s)]
*  but some experts think that they could start [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=342.52s)]
*  hitting the market sometime in the next decade. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=344.48s)]
*  While Musk's vision of putting chips into healthy brains [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=347.24s)]
*  is likely much further away than that, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=350.04s)]
*  the uses for BCIs have the potential [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=352.52s)]
*  to expand in that time, too. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=354.76s)]
*  Motif NeuroTech, for instance, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=356.72s)]
*  is working on minimally invasive BCI technology [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=358.6s)]
*  that could help treat mental health disorders [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=361.84s)]
*  like depression. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=363.96s)]
*  Where I see the future is a company, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  maybe NeuroLink or Paradromix, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=368.28s)]
*  that focus on high bandwidth. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=370.04s)]
*  There's gonna be companies like Synchron and Motif [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=371.68s)]
*  that focus on minimal invasiveness. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=375.15999999999997s)]
*  Naturally, those customers are gonna start [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  to look different. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=377.84s)]
*  At that point, I think there's gonna be more competition [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=378.76s)]
*  between these companies as they start to establish [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=380.0s)]
*  who is the number one person in NeuroTech. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=381.88s)]
*  But right now, I think there's room for all of us [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=383.64s)]
*  to try to find a space. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwVBroYd3Q&t=385.64s)]
