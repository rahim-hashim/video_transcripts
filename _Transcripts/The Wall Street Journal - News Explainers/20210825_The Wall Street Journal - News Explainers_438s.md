# Tencent: Tech Giant Behind Videogame Favorites Faces Beijing’s Scrutiny | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 25, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM)
*  From Pokemon Unite to League of Legends and Fortnite, these are some of the most popular [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=0.0s)]
*  video games in the world. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  And behind them is a Chinese company you may not be familiar with. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=13.24s)]
*  Hanson is China's largest social media company. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=16.52s)]
*  It is also the world's largest video game company by revenue. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=20.46s)]
*  Last year, it reported more than $22 billion in revenue from smartphone games and nearly [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=24.68s)]
*  $7 billion from PC games. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  But that growth could hit a roadblock. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=31.64s)]
*  Since late 2020, Beijing has embarked on a clampdown of its homegrown tech giants, and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=33.64s)]
*  Tencent is one of them. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=38.4s)]
*  It's facing more scrutiny over its business practices, including its allegedly [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=39.96s)]
*  anticompetitive behaviors. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=44.04s)]
*  Regulators are also concerned that young Chinese citizens may become addicted to video [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=45.88s)]
*  games. Regulations are always looming in China. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  From now on, they can only become stricter and stricter. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  We take a look at Tencent's video game portfolio over the years to see how it became a [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=57.6s)]
*  giant in the industry and what Beijing's regulatory crackdown could mean for the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=62.28s)]
*  company's global empire. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=66.4s)]
*  Tencent made its entrance into the video game world with one of the biggest names in the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=73.08s)]
*  industry, League of Legends. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=76.84s)]
*  But before explaining how Tencent got there, you first need to understand that it didn't [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=80.16s)]
*  start off as a video game company. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=84.12s)]
*  The Chinese tech giant has businesses in music, video streaming and search engines. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=86.36s)]
*  But it's best known for its social networking app WeChat, which does everything from [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=90.76s)]
*  handling payments to booking doctor's appointments. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=94.76s)]
*  The app has over 1.2 billion monthly active users, and that's been key to reaching a [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=97.72s)]
*  vast network of gamers in China. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=102.6s)]
*  There's no company on the planet that has this advantage that Tencent has. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=104.84s)]
*  Serkan Toto is an independent video game industry consultant in Japan, and he's been [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=110.68s)]
*  watching the sector for more than a decade. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=115.08s)]
*  They turned WeChat into a gaming platform and they also use it as an incredibly powerful [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  distribution tool, marketing tool, user acquisition tool. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=124.12s)]
*  They're making aggressive use of that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=127.56s)]
*  The company has been building its own online games since 2003, developing some relatively [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=130.32s)]
*  simple games like these. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=135.32s)]
*  To more sophisticated ones. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=140.48s)]
*  Over the years, Tencent has also tried to export some of them, but they failed to take [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=142.92s)]
*  off in the West. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  The best example is probably Honor of Kings, which is the world's biggest mobile game by [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  revenue. Very well made, but they are designed to appeal to Chinese gamers, for example. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  The world building characters, the stories, the narratives. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=160.88s)]
*  Video game industry analysts say some of Tencent's flops may have accelerated the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=166.32s)]
*  company's foreign investments. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=170.32s)]
*  And this brings us back to League of Legends. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=173.6s)]
*  In 2009, the company became the official Chinese distributor of the U.S. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=175.88s)]
*  developed game. It's not a casual game. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=179.96s)]
*  It's not a very easy to play game. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=182.0s)]
*  After launch, it just developed into a crowd pleaser. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=183.72s)]
*  Toto says this kind of growth helped push Tencent to make a bold move with a Los Angeles [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=188.4s)]
*  startup. In 2011, they made their first big international investment in a gaming company [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=192.96s)]
*  into Riot Games, which operates one of the world's biggest PC games, League of Legends [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=199.12s)]
*  right now. Tencent paid $400 million for a 93 percent stake in the American company. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=204.44s)]
*  And four years later, it scooped up the remaining 7 percent, taking full control of Riot [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=210.16s)]
*  Games. Riot Games, they needed funds to scale the company. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=214.88s)]
*  League of Legends became big so quickly and on such an international scale, mainly [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=218.4s)]
*  because of Tencent's investment. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=224.88s)]
*  With Tencent's backing, League of Legends monthly players have grown by almost tenfold. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=229.6s)]
*  And in the past decade, the game has made some 20 billion dollars in revenue. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=233.88s)]
*  This early success has basically triggered something inside Tencent. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=238.12s)]
*  Right. And it showed Tencent internally that there's a big opportunity not only in China, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=242.84s)]
*  but also outside of China if you make the right moves in terms of investing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  The success of League of Legends helped kickstart a shopping spree. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=252.88s)]
*  Tencent made its second big move in 2012 by investing in another American game developer, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=256.47999999999996s)]
*  Epic Games, the company behind Fortnite, Activision Blizzard, which is North America's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  biggest video game publisher by market value, Supercell, the Finnish developer behind Clash [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=266.47999999999996s)]
*  of Clans, Bluehole, the South Korean game maker behind the Battle Royale sensation, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  PUBG. The Chinese company hasn't just acquired stakes, but also found ways to collaborate. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=276.36s)]
*  Roblox, the online game platform popular with young kids, entered into a joint venture with [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=281.56s)]
*  Tencent to make its entry into China. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=286.44s)]
*  And the Pokemon company worked with Tencent to develop a new game called Pokemon Unite. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=288.88s)]
*  And as video game companies saw a big boom during the pandemic with people stuck at home, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=293.8s)]
*  Tencent has already closed 12 game related deals overseas this year. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=298.24s)]
*  Tencent has to expand globally in the gaming market because it needs to seek more [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  growth. It will also become easier for them to get exclusive distribution rights for these [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=311.32s)]
*  games. And that also further cements their dominance in the home market, too. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=316.76s)]
*  But this dominance at home has raised concerns among regulators about the gaming habits of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=323.52s)]
*  young people. The worst crackdown that Tencent has faced so far is probably the 2018 episode [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=327.52s)]
*  when the Chinese government suspended approval of new games for about a year. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  Then this year, as part of a larger regulatory crackdown, Beijing began looking more closely at [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=341.32s)]
*  Tencent. In August, a Chinese state newspaper called online games Opium for the Mind. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=345.96s)]
*  Later, the article was taken down, then republished without the phrase Opium for the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  Mind. After the article's publication, Tencent saw a big sell off and its share price dropped [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=356.52s)]
*  about 10 percent in just one day. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=361.67999999999995s)]
*  So there is a lot of confusion whether that article represents any actual policy agenda. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=363.76s)]
*  So Tencent has pledged to enforce tougher rules than required by the authorities. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=370.96s)]
*  Young gamers will only be allowed to play for one hour on weekdays and two hours on [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=375.12s)]
*  weekends and holidays. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=379.24s)]
*  We haven't seen the current regulatory storm really hit the core of Tencent yet. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=381.24s)]
*  When other companies took a very big hit, it also raises the question whether Tencent [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=388.68s)]
*  will be the next. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=395.48s)]
*  Toto says this type of uncertainty at home might push Tencent to see that the bigger [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  opportunities are overseas. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=400.76s)]
*  Tencent is most likely to even more focus on its global gaming business going forward. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  You want to make sure that you use your capital effectively outside of China to offset [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=408.4s)]
*  certain risks. Tencent said it's committed to growing the game sector in China while [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=413.52s)]
*  looking at potential investments abroad that can bring strategic value to the company. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=418.2s)]
*  I think that Tencent is going to try to acquire even more studios, even more developers [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=423.0s)]
*  outside its home market. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=429.32s)]
*  And that could mean that the next blockbuster games you'll be playing could have Tencent [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  behind them. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-JZgddZaM&t=434.24s)]
