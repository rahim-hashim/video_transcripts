# Clinton vs. Harris Inside the Transformational Shifts in Gender Politics  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk)
*  On the campaign trail, Kamala Harris is facing a lot of comments like this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=0.0s)]
*  That is the laugh of a crazy person. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=4.4s)]
*  She slept her way to the top. It's a fact. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  And back in 2016 with Hillary Clinton, a lot sounded the same. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=9.84s)]
*  Well, I think the only card she has is the woman's card. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=13.92s)]
*  It's very loud and shrill and it does not come off well. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=16.56s)]
*  But in the eight years since Hillary Clinton lost, a lot has changed. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=21.12s)]
*  We all, this country, have given women a lot more leeway in the last eight years [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=25.2s)]
*  to be who they are in politics in a way that we never have before. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=30.0s)]
*  Here's a closer look at how the politics of gender have shifted [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=33.36s)]
*  and what it means for the presidential race. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=36.8s)]
*  I accept your nomination. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=40.96s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris is only the second woman and the first woman [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=43.84s)]
*  of Black and South Asian descent to head a major party's presidential ticket. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=48.0s)]
*  Even before she became the Democratic nominee for president, Kamala Harris [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=52.32s)]
*  faced various racial and gender-based attacks on her candidacy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=55.84s)]
*  Those attacks began just days after Harris secured the Democratic nomination. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=60.72s)]
*  Kamala Harris is somebody who's not competent to be president of the United States [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=65.2s)]
*  and has a very evil, wicked, Jezebelian agenda. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=70.32s)]
*  Other conservatives have suggested she slept her way to the top, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=74.08s)]
*  referencing her brief relationship with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=77.76s)]
*  It is relevant when a young candidate tries to sleep her way into politics and into power. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  In a resurfaced clip from 2021, Republican vice presidential pick [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  J.D. Vance questioned why Harris hasn't had any biological children. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=93.12s)]
*  We're effectively run in this country via the Democrats, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=97.36000000000001s)]
*  via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=100.64s)]
*  Hillary Clinton experienced similar attacks on the campaign trail. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  Such a nasty woman. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=107.44s)]
*  I think a lot of it with Hillary Clinton has to do with style and delivery, oddly enough. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=109.28s)]
*  She shouts. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  We heard a lot about shrill voices at the time. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=116.88s)]
*  We heard a lot about women yelling at the time. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  Amanda Rentaria was the national political director for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=122.48s)]
*  working behind the scenes to manage relationships with key stakeholders. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=128.16s)]
*  When you're preparing someone for an interview or you're preparing them for the debate [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  and the constraints around women, you can't be too hard, you can't be too soft. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=137.2s)]
*  I think the humorlessness in her campaign is one of the strategic deficits that she's facing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump would be yelling and not be nice intentionally. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=148.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, I was getting calls where she had to be nice and at the same time make sure she's credible. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  Harris's multiracial identity has also fueled more attacks. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  Some Republicans have called Harris a DEI hire, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  suggesting she only received the nomination because of her race and gender. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=164.96s)]
*  She's openly a DEI hire. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  100 percent she was a DEI hire. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  They seem much more animated by the idea that she's been promoted because of her race and gender, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=173.92s)]
*  that she has not succeeded on her own merits. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=179.76s)]
*  They realized it had to be a black woman in the vice presidency, now the presidency. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=182.24s)]
*  That's exactly the reason Kamala got her job. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=186.16s)]
*  When you're an operative and you look at the numbers or you're doing the data analysis, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=188.48s)]
*  you just know there's a group of people who are going to hear Kamala as a women's name and say, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=192.24s)]
*  that's not for me. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=198.4s)]
*  Many Democrats are worried that Kamala Harris may struggle to earn the support of voters who [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=199.6s)]
*  view her skeptically as both a woman, woman of color, and a California liberal, particularly [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  those white voters without college degrees in places like those crucial blue wall states [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=211.28s)]
*  of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=216.88s)]
*  Polling experts say Harris could offset any drop-off in support from white men by adding [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=219.44s)]
*  more women, but history suggests this could be a challenge. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=224.24s)]
*  One of the really remarkable things about Hillary Clinton's candidacy, given the history [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=228.24s)]
*  she was poised to make, was that she didn't really galvanize female voters around her candidacy. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=232.72s)]
*  But a lot has changed since then. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=238.24s)]
*  The fallout from Trump's election mobilized women in an entirely new way. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=240.8s)]
*  Immediately after Donald Trump was elected in 2016, we had the Women's March, millions of women [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=244.8s)]
*  pouring into the streets all over the world. At the time, it was the largest single-day protest [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=250.32000000000002s)]
*  in history. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=254.72s)]
*  Women around the country have changed. They actually see themselves as part of this electoral [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=259.2s)]
*  process, not it happening to them. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=264.16s)]
*  Then in 2017, the MeToo movement began gaining momentum. It brought renewed attention to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  barriers women faced in the workplace and helped Democrats by mobilizing young female voters. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=272.16s)]
*  In 2019, there were more than 100 women representatives in the House for the first [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=277.52000000000004s)]
*  time in history. Then in 2022, the Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=282.48s)]
*  Once they have seen that abortion rights are at stake, we see a lot of women getting off the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  sidelines, registering to vote, and coming out to vote, even in red states that don't usually [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  vote for Democratic candidates. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=301.28s)]
*  Why exactly is it that they don't trust women? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=303.28s)]
*  Well, we trust women. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=308.96s)]
*  After the Democratic National Convention, a Wall Street Journal poll found Harris expanded her lead [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  as the candidate best suited to handle abortion rights. Things are also shifting on the Republican [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=317.76s)]
*  side. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=323.2s)]
*  We also saw a woman Republican candidate, Nikki Haley, be the last candidate standing against [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=323.76s)]
*  Donald Trump in the Republican primary and get quite a lot of votes, although of course she was [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=329.68s)]
*  not successful. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=334.08s)]
*  The fact that we have seen more women in those roles just gives you a different view of what [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=335.2s)]
*  could be. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=340.08s)]
*  In this changing political landscape, Harris's campaign is taking a new approach to the rhetoric [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=340.96s)]
*  leveled at her race and gender. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=345.92s)]
*  In 2016, Hillary Clinton talked a lot about her gender and reacted with maximum indignation and [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=347.76s)]
*  outrage when Trump said anything offensive. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=354.32s)]
*  You could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  So far, Harris has avoided race and gender as a central part of her campaign messaging, a major [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=362.0s)]
*  shift from Clinton's glass ceiling rhetoric. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=367.76s)]
*  In her speech accepting the Democratic nomination, she did not mention race or gender even once. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=370.32s)]
*  The feeling among her campaign is that she makes a statement simply by being who she is and she [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=376.0s)]
*  doesn't have to spell it out for people. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=382.64000000000004s)]
*  He suggested that you happened to turn black recently for political purposes, questioning a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  core part of your identity. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  Any same old tired playbook? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=393.84s)]
*  Next question, please. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=396.96s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=398.79999999999995s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=399.52s)]
*  Rather than expressing that outrage and indignation, they've tried to laugh it off. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  They ridicule it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  They've depicted it as weird. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=405.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, it's true. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=408.08s)]
*  These guys are just weird. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=408.56s)]
*  It is. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=409.67999999999995s)]
*  And it is. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=410.16s)]
*  They're running for He-Man Women Haters Club or something. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=411.36s)]
*  Trump has a long history of derogatory comments against women, with Republicans vying for more [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=414.8s)]
*  female and black voters. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  This could be a liability for the Trump campaign. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=421.36s)]
*  Crazy Nancy Pelosi, she was always saying she's crazy as a bedbug, that one. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=428.8s)]
*  Some GOP leaders urged Republicans to stay away from criticizing Harris' race and gender. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=434.8s)]
*  This election, as I noted at the outset, is going to be about policies, not personalities. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=440.64s)]
*  This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris and her ethnicity or her gender. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  It had nothing to do with us whatsoever. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=451.68s)]
*  I think it tells you a lot about where the country is on these issues, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=453.36s)]
*  that Republicans know that these attacks don't play well. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=456.16s)]
*  Harris' rapid ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket has upended Trump's [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=459.44s)]
*  once comfortable lead in the polls against Biden. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=463.68s)]
*  A Wall Street Journal poll conducted in August found Harris is narrowly ahead of Trump. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=466.08s)]
*  Harris had 48 percent support to Trump's 47 percent. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=471.2s)]
*  She has improved her standing in the polls primarily by getting [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=475.12s)]
*  Democratic base voters off the sidelines. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=478.56s)]
*  She's improved on Joe Biden's standing with young voters, women voters, people of color. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=480.96000000000004s)]
*  But Trump has remained at about the same level. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=486.24s)]
*  The other thing that's interesting, particularly in the battleground states, is she's not losing [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=488.64s)]
*  any of Joe Biden's supporters. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=493.52s)]
*  This is still a race that is within the margin of error, too close to call, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=495.12s)]
*  and it's going to be a knockdown dragout fight between these two candidates from now until November 5th. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKReMIllogk&t=499.44s)]
