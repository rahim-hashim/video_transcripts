# The Economic Ripple Effect of Retail Sales, Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 19, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY)
*  Retail sales, a measure of purchases at stores, restaurants, and online, increased in May [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=0.0s)]
*  by 17.7% from a month earlier, a positive sign as the economy looks to bounce back from [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=5.4s)]
*  coronavirus lockdowns. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=12.0s)]
*  This type of spending is a big deal. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Although it makes up a relatively small portion of GDP, it's an important driver of economic [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=16.4s)]
*  growth because retail sales affect more than just retailers. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=21.32s)]
*  They create a ripple effect throughout the economy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=25.0s)]
*  That's why analysts and economists are paying close attention to this monthly indicator, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=27.72s)]
*  as a way to gauge whether the economy at large is recovering. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=32.04s)]
*  Here's how the retail spending ripple effect works. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=38.4s)]
*  When consumers spend at stores, those stores order more merchandise, which means manufacturers [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=41.64s)]
*  produce more and order more raw materials. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=46.72s)]
*  So when consumers open their wallets, the economy tends to run smoother. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  And this type of spending adds up. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=55.76s)]
*  Retail sales have been growing for decades, except for a short dip around the last recession. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=57.96s)]
*  Between 1992 and 2018, retail sales have almost tripled from $1.8 trillion to $5.3 trillion. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=63.04s)]
*  This includes auto sales, sales at clothing retailers, and general merchandisers like [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=71.32s)]
*  department stores, food and beverage sales, and e-commerce. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=76.32s)]
*  During the pandemic, some of these categories have struggled more than others. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=81.64s)]
*  Auto sales declined sharply as lockdowns swept across the country in March and April. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=86.32s)]
*  The biggest component of retail sales is spending on new cars and also spending on gasoline. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=91.56s)]
*  Now those two categories have been really hard hit in the coronavirus pandemic because [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=95.52s)]
*  people are not commuting, so they're not spending on gas. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=99.44s)]
*  And also because there's been so much fluctuation in the labor market, people are sort of less [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=102.2s)]
*  inclined to buy a new car because they might not necessarily be sure if they're going [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=106.48s)]
*  to have a job next month. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=109.92s)]
*  Many brick and mortar clothing retailers and department stores saw sales all but disappear [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=111.52s)]
*  during coronavirus lockdowns. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=116.08s)]
*  In April, spending on clothing was down nearly 90 percent from the previous year. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=118.4s)]
*  Neiman Marcus, JCPenney, and J. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=123.92s)]
*  Crew, which were all under pressure before the pandemic hit, have recently filed for [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=126.48s)]
*  bankruptcy. Well, the coronavirus pandemic took a huge hit on retail sales purely because [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=131.24s)]
*  people were stuck at home. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=136.4s)]
*  You know, they had to stay in their houses due to the due to the spread of the virus. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=137.6s)]
*  So really, the only areas that we saw much spending were on food. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=141.88s)]
*  Sales for food and beverages haven't been as deeply impacted. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  While spending at bars and restaurants has gone down, people have been stocking up at [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=150.96s)]
*  grocery stores. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  Spending at bars and restaurants has been hit really hard. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=156.84s)]
*  I mean, a lot of places did manage to continue to provide takeout and curbside delivery and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=159.12s)]
*  so on. But what we did see was a big bump in March when people were stocking up. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=163.88s)]
*  You know, they really wanted to fill their shelves in preparation for the shutdowns. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=167.32s)]
*  Spending online, however, has accelerated. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=171.32s)]
*  Consumers increased online purchases in May from the same period last year by almost 31 [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=174.28s)]
*  percent. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=179.84s)]
*  Well, every month that this that, you know, that coronavirus has been going on, we've [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=181.28s)]
*  seen a greater share of retail sales at non-store retailers, like, for instance, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  Amazon.com. For many people, the only option that they have to to to buy certain products [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=188.84s)]
*  is to go online and spend online. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=193.64s)]
*  More recently, there have been signs that retail might be recovering. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=195.27999999999997s)]
*  The retail sector lost almost 2.3 million jobs in April, but added nearly 370,000 [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  back in May. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=204.92s)]
*  And the hope is that that will continue as people kind of start to get out and about [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  and to to recover and to spend more money after after the shutdowns are over. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=210.2s)]
*  Essentially, the last phase of the recovery will be people going back into stores, into [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=214.27999999999997s)]
*  malls, into enclosed spaces and feeling comfortable. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=219.27999999999997s)]
*  How confident consumers feel about going out and spending money safely will help determine [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=222.44s)]
*  how quickly retail sales might improve and ripple around the economy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwBPniHN0IY&t=227.36s)]
