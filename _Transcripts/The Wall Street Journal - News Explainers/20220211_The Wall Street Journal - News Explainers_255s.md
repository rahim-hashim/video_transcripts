# How a Fed Interest Rate Increase Could Affect You | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM)
*  The Federal Reserve has signaled that it would begin steadily raising interest rates in mid-March. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=0.0s)]
*  Against a backdrop of elevated inflation and a strong labor market, our policy has been [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=5.24s)]
*  adapting to the evolving economic environment. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  It's the latest step the Fed is taking toward removing stimulus to bring down inflation, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=13.08s)]
*  and marks the first time it has raised borrowing costs since December of 2018. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=17.96s)]
*  Expectations of a faster pace of rate rises prompted investors to change strategies they [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=23.48s)]
*  had used for nearly two years, leading to the worst stock market sell-off since the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=28.939999999999998s)]
*  early days of the pandemic. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=34.26s)]
*  WSJ personal finance reporter J.J. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=36.54s)]
*  McCorvey breaks down how the rate hike could affect mortgages, loans, credit cards, and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=38.98s)]
*  your retirement planning. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=44.5s)]
*  The mortgage rates have already been increasing in anticipation of the Fed rate hikes, but [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=46.379999999999995s)]
*  now they're expected to go up even more through 2022. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=57.38s)]
*  However, if you have a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, you have less reason to worry because [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=60.980000000000004s)]
*  your rate is locked and you likely won't be affected. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=67.26s)]
*  While fixed-rate mortgages have a set interest rate for the life of the loan, repayments [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=70.42s)]
*  on adjustable-rate mortgages become more expensive when interest rates go up. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=74.82000000000001s)]
*  The rate increase could also pose challenges for those shopping for a home. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=79.86s)]
*  For people who are new home buyers, the higher rates could make it harder to qualify for [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=83.94s)]
*  a mortgage. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=87.89999999999999s)]
*  Even small rate increases can be costly if applied to big purchases when stretched over [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=89.34s)]
*  the life of a multi-year loan. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=94.3s)]
*  Rising rates will impact both private and federal student loans. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=100.74s)]
*  New interest rates apply to only new loans, but people who have existing private loans [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=104.66s)]
*  might have the option to refinance. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=109.3s)]
*  Refinancing student loans could be a good option for those who qualify for a better [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=112.1s)]
*  rate based on changes in credit or income. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=116.53999999999999s)]
*  When it comes to auto loans, similar to fixed-rate mortgages, most won't be affected if you [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=119.94s)]
*  already have one because they usually come with a fixed interest rate. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=124.94s)]
*  But if you're shopping for a car, a new loan with higher interest means you'll be paying [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=128.85999999999999s)]
*  a little more money. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=132.98s)]
*  Interest rates on credit cards are typically not fixed. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=138.42s)]
*  In fact, credit card interest rates change almost immediately after a Fed rate increase. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=141.14s)]
*  If your interest rate rises, so could your minimum payment, and that can make it harder [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  to pay off debt. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=150.7s)]
*  While higher interest rates means more money can be earned from savings, if you carry a [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=152.42s)]
*  credit card balance month to month, a higher interest charge could be applied to those [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=156.5s)]
*  balances. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=160.73999999999998s)]
*  Paying balances in full will help avoid additional costs. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=162.22s)]
*  If you have an interest-bearing savings account, that could mean a little more money for you. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=165.46s)]
*  But how much that changes depends on your bank. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=174.58s)]
*  The national average interest rate for savings accounts is 0.06 percent, but some banks have [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=177.38s)]
*  savings rates higher than the national average, which will earn savers more money. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=183.06s)]
*  Experts say fixed-rate savings such as annuities and short-term bond yields will also rise. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=188.46s)]
*  This could benefit folks who live off interest. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=194.5s)]
*  Markets have already experienced some volatility due to the expected rate hike, which has pushed [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=197.3s)]
*  some investors toward safer bets. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=202.74s)]
*  Those safer bets could include dividend stocks and gold exchange-traded funds, some of which [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=205.5s)]
*  have outperformed this year. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=210.64s)]
*  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has left the door open to raising rates at consecutive [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=216.14s)]
*  policy meetings, which are held about every six weeks. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=220.54s)]
*  The Fed hasn't raised rates at that frequency since 2006. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=224.18s)]
*  While Powell says he expects inflation rates to decline through the course of the year, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=228.22s)]
*  he admits the economic outlook remains highly uncertain. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  With this in mind, we will remain attentive to risks, including the risk that high inflation [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=236.62s)]
*  is more persistent than expected and are prepared to respond as appropriate to achieve our goals. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYdAZQCjtM&t=242.02s)]
