# The Nissan-Renault Shakeup, Explained in Five Minutes | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M)
*  Renault and Nissan have announced a long plan overhaul of their more than 20 year old alliance. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=0.0s)]
*  We are now ready to move our partnership obviously to a new era. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=6.28s)]
*  The partnership withstood the ousting of a leader, a global pandemic and growing pains. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=12.08s)]
*  The CEOs of both companies spoke to the Wall Street Journal about their restructured alliance [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  and what it means for investors and the global industry. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=22.84s)]
*  This is how we can transform under these difficult circumstances that we are facing today. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=26.28s)]
*  So we're trying to create a company that is much more agile, more oriented to innovation [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=31.96s)]
*  because technology is evolutionary. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=37.08s)]
*  But first, how did we get here? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=39.8s)]
*  The partnership dates to 1999 when Renault took a more than one third stake in Nissan, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=44.28s)]
*  which was struggling. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=48.88s)]
*  They were in this kind of marriage where they had to get the agreement of the other if they [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=49.88s)]
*  wanted to cooperate. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  At the height of the alliance, they were joined by Mitsubishi Motors and had a combined sales [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=56.28s)]
*  of more than 10 million vehicles a year. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=60.28s)]
*  But beneath the surface, Nissan saw the partnership as uneven with Renault holding a controlling [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=63.6s)]
*  stake in the Japanese carmaker. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=68.04s)]
*  On the other hand, Renault felt it wasn't getting enough for its large stake. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=70.2s)]
*  There was also a clash of corporate cultures. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=73.68s)]
*  For years, industry veteran Carlos Ghosn headed both companies and was able to smooth out [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  differences with his forceful personality. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=80.88s)]
*  But when Ghosn was arrested in Japan over financial charges in 2018, tensions between [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=84.68s)]
*  Renault and Nissan spilled out into the open. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=89.12s)]
*  He denies the charges and eventually fled the country. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=92.28s)]
*  When you took Carlos Ghosn out of the equation, there was no real good way for these companies [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=95.2s)]
*  to cooperate. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=99.66000000000001s)]
*  And you realize that actually what Ghosn had been doing for so many years was refereeing [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=101.0s)]
*  some kind of cat fight. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  Then came further challenges. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=106.28s)]
*  of it, supply chains, and we have a geopolitical situation. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=108.32s)]
*  Make the material cost and the hike and the cost is going to the skyrocket situation. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=113.24s)]
*  Renault had to sell its majority stakes in Russia's biggest automaker after the Ukraine [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  war broke out. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=123.16s)]
*  It capped off more than two years of losses. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=124.58s)]
*  Two years and a half ago, we were really in bad shape. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=127.22s)]
*  We lost like eight billion euros in a semester. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  So that was like... [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=133.84s)]
*  Well, so we are. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=134.84s)]
*  We lost 600 billion. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=135.84s)]
*  And that's red. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=136.84s)]
*  Amid the crisis, Renault's CEO thought there was also an opportunity for the French carmaker [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=139.12s)]
*  to reinvent itself. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=143.36s)]
*  And all the things we're doing are first to make sure that Renault, you know, on the next [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=145.36s)]
*  Grand Prix will be better positioned because it will be different rules, different technical [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=151.16s)]
*  setup, et cetera. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=156.12s)]
*  But it's never done against the Alliance or against Nissan. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=157.68s)]
*  In fact, they can take advantage of our experience, I think, also and vice versa. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=160.8s)]
*  It became clear to both sides they'd be better off operating more independently of each other. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  We had many things in the past, right? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=170.34s)]
*  But we are not doing this like for the sake of the rebalancing or, you know, Nissan victory, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=172.44s)]
*  Renault victory on the historical items. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=180.12s)]
*  I think we have to sometimes go back to the original spirit, which was a very, very pragmatic [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  collaboration. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=189.56s)]
*  That's what we've tried to do. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=190.56s)]
*  Under the new agreement, Renault will reduce its stake in Nissan from 43 percent to 15 [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=192.68s)]
*  percent. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=197.44s)]
*  Nissan will also invest in Renault's electric vehicle and software business. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=198.44s)]
*  They can keep cooperating on certain things if they want and if both parties see the benefit [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  or they can go and seek other partners if they think they can get a better deal. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=206.56s)]
*  My focus is, of course, is creating the uniqueness of Renault that needs to be different from [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=209.94s)]
*  Nissan. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=214.4s)]
*  They have to have a different strategy from us. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=215.52s)]
*  It's good. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=217.8s)]
*  We cannot really do the business in extension from the past way for the future because the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=218.8s)]
*  circumstances are totally different. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=225.16000000000003s)]
*  This is why we made this announcement to go into the next era and what kind of governance [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=227.12s)]
*  that we should have in the partnership or structure. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  The deal comes as both companies look to new types of partnerships in batteries, EV technology [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=237.0s)]
*  and software. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=241.84s)]
*  The chipmaker Qualcomm has already said it would take a stake in Renault's new EV business, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=244.76s)]
*  Ampere. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=249.44s)]
*  Ampere is a very reasonable investment with a very strong return on the capital allocation [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=250.44s)]
*  for Nissan or for any investor with very good products that people are willing to pay for. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=256.68s)]
*  This is a chance that many other newcomers coming from the outside don't have. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=264.56s)]
*  Renault and Nissan have said their alliance will continue and announced joint projects [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=270.64s)]
*  in markets such as Argentina, Mexico and India. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=274.16s)]
*  We are setting up the new stage for the alliance, how to collaborate, how to work and if there's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=277.32000000000005s)]
*  opportunity, why not? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=281.16s)]
*  But several issues remain open. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=283.16s)]
*  Nissan did not say how much it would invest in Renault's EV company. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=285.44s)]
*  Also under negotiation is the intellectual property that goes into that Renault venture, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=288.98s)]
*  which is owned by Nissan. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=292.92s)]
*  This is also why it's difficult for investors because there are still some negotiations [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=294.56s)]
*  to take place. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=298.18s)]
*  This isn't like the complete end of the story. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZgQIYOB5M&t=299.18s)]
