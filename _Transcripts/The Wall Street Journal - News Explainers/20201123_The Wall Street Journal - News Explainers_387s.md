# How 2020 Is Reshaping Black Friday | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 23, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk)
*  For years, the cornerstone of the holiday shopping season has been Black Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=0.0s)]
*  In Buffalo, New York, shoppers stampeded at Target. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=7.24s)]
*  And the crowds just keep getting bigger and bigger. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=11.08s)]
*  This place is packed with people and it has been since five o'clock. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Not only is it a time of sales, but it helps people psychologically, helps us shoppers [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=18.84s)]
*  think, oh yeah, Christmas is coming and Hanukkah is coming. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=23.56s)]
*  I'm going to be with my family. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=27.0s)]
*  Let me start buying things. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=28.32s)]
*  Waking up at the crack of dawn to rush into stores became somewhat of a holiday tradition [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  for many families. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=34.56s)]
*  These are deadly discounts! [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=35.8s)]
*  But this year is shaping up to look different. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=39.64s)]
*  What the pandemic has done is actually accelerate the trends that we've seen. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=42.8s)]
*  And that is a move to contactless, a move to convenience, really a move toward digital [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=46.36s)]
*  instead of kind of traditional shopping experience. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=53.04s)]
*  So I think that's going to be a lasting change if we see as a result. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=56.04s)]
*  The shopping tradition dates back to the 1920s and 30s, when families would start buying [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=60.36s)]
*  holiday gifts the day after Thanksgiving. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=65.16s)]
*  Traditionally, this was the first day that retailers would start advertising for Christmas. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=67.56s)]
*  But by the 2000s, companies were announcing Black Friday doorbuster deals earlier and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=72.52s)]
*  earlier. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Target stores opened at five this morning and there were plenty of excited shoppers [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=80.44s)]
*  on hand. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=84.24s)]
*  There were these few horrific moments where people were dying or getting seriously injured [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=85.24s)]
*  because of people rushing into a building. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  Some department stores were opening at midnight. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  And within a few years, the deals were creeping into Thanksgiving Day. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=95.88s)]
*  By the 2010s, the one-day event had ballooned to cover the full holiday weekend. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=100.64s)]
*  But around this time, retailers were also launching more online sales on the Monday [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=106.0s)]
*  after Thanksgiving. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  This was known as Cyber Monday, and it was growing fast. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=111.92s)]
*  In 2016, Cyber Monday sales hit a new record of nearly $3.5 billion. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=115.52s)]
*  Digital became much more important to the consumer. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=121.88s)]
*  So what we found is Cyber Monday actually started to take on a heightened importance. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  For many companies, Thanksgiving weekend starting with Black Friday and stretching into Cyber [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=129.04s)]
*  Monday is one of the most lucrative times of the year. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=134.08s)]
*  But recently, appetite for the chaos of Black Friday has started to fade. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=137.76s)]
*  And then in 2020, the retail industry and how people shopped changed. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=142.44s)]
*  Retailers across the country announcing closures and shortening their store hours in the hopes [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=148.84s)]
*  of limiting the outbreak. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=152.14s)]
*  Add in the coronavirus pandemic and there are retailers that may not survive. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  We've seen massive amounts of retail closings, accelerated bankruptcies this year. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=157.84s)]
*  That means there's probably going to be fewer stores and there might be more of a consolidation [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=163.76s)]
*  and where people go to some of these big box stores that have been open and operating the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=170.48s)]
*  whole time. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=175.0s)]
*  During lockdowns in March and April, spending slid off a cliff, with a record drop in retail [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=176.29999999999998s)]
*  sales as people were forced to stay home due to the coronavirus pandemic. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  Between April and October, around 5,000 U.S. stores went out of business. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=186.0s)]
*  But even the retailers that had weathered the pandemic are changing the way they operate. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=191.02s)]
*  This year, retailers for the first time in modern memory are saying, we're not going [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=195.42000000000002s)]
*  to be open on Thanksgiving. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=200.82000000000002s)]
*  Black Friday will be open the day afterwards, but on Thanksgiving, deals are online. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=203.26000000000002s)]
*  When stores open, consumers can expect limited hours in capacity, curbside pickups, and a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=207.62s)]
*  much calmer atmosphere than years past. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=213.5s)]
*  When folks go in a store, they're wearing a mask, they're being counted, and stores [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=216.38s)]
*  are being cleaned all the time. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=220.46s)]
*  But perhaps the biggest change of them all? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=221.98000000000002s)]
*  The shift to online shopping. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=224.3s)]
*  A recent survey found that 70% of consumers plan to shop online more than normal to avoid [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=226.22s)]
*  crowds and exposure to the coronavirus. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=231.58s)]
*  But this doesn't mean that brick and mortar stores will disappear entirely. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=234.3s)]
*  We mostly still shop in stores, even now, even in a pandemic. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  I know folks have been talking for years about the fact that stores would just slowly disappear. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=242.26000000000002s)]
*  Shopping will change, how we discover products will change. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=247.06s)]
*  And how these products get delivered will change, too. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=249.82s)]
*  As a result of the shift to online shopping, e-commerce stores are facing major delivery [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=253.26s)]
*  logistics and shipping hurdles this year. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=257.9s)]
*  During the beginning of the pandemic, consumers were faced with month-long delays as ports [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=260.74s)]
*  closed and supply chains broke down. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=264.94s)]
*  Now the question is whether shipping companies can handle the mass influx of online orders [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=268.06s)]
*  that are expected over the next two months. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=272.34s)]
*  A big reason that retailers are pushing people to shop online earlier is to spread out sales [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=275.82s)]
*  and give a little breathing room to the e-commerce supply chains. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=280.86s)]
*  But right now, the numbers don't look too promising. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=284.46s)]
*  The shipping industry is expected to be more than 4 million packages over capacity during [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=287.26s)]
*  the peak of the holiday season this year. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=292.02s)]
*  It's going to be really hard to order something two days before Christmas and have it arrive. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=294.02s)]
*  That literally might not be an option even if you're willing to pay $50 for shipping [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=298.02s)]
*  because there won't be capacity to get it to you. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=302.46s)]
*  Which could push people to stores. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=305.22s)]
*  But at the same time, many have lost their jobs due to the pandemic this year and may [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=307.86s)]
*  not have the ability to buy gifts. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=312.22s)]
*  We have around 20 million people on unemployment. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  There was a little bit of a false sense of security that came because we got big stimulus [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=319.38000000000005s)]
*  checks in the spring. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=323.54s)]
*  There was additional unemployment that people were getting until the end of July. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=325.1s)]
*  A lot of that is gone or up in the air. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=329.54s)]
*  It hasn't really been resolved. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=332.90000000000003s)]
*  So retailers are definitely ready for lots of consumers not to feel like buying at all [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=334.62s)]
*  or buying a lot less. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=341.54s)]
*  And even for folks that have jobs, I think my sense is talking to retailers and consultants, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=343.06s)]
*  those folks are saving a lot more. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=349.26s)]
*  Which points to a little bit of caution. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=351.74s)]
*  This means that certain retailers that cater to pandemic living, like groceries and home [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=354.14s)]
*  improvement, could continue to see profits. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=358.42s)]
*  While those that would traditionally see big sales around Black Friday, such as clothing [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=361.46s)]
*  and toys, could see bigger losses. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=365.14s)]
*  The past year has upended the retail industry and shaken up what is traditionally the biggest [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=367.73999999999995s)]
*  sales period of the year. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=372.41999999999996s)]
*  But most notably, 2020 has solidified the trend towards online shopping as a permanent [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=374.46s)]
*  part of the retail industry's future. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuuvES1hPbk&t=379.34s)]
