# Why EVs Could Mean the UAW Has a Long, Challenging Road Ahead  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4)
*  Batteries may be small, but for the United Auto Workers Union, they're a big deal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=0.0s)]
*  It's going to change the future of our union and the future of our industry. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=4.0s)]
*  At least 25,000 members of the UAW have been striking simultaneously at plants owned by GM, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=8.88s)]
*  Ford and Stellantis, as they demand increased pay and better job security. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=14.72s)]
*  No justice, no G! [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=18.8s)]
*  And at the heart of their negotiations lies a question around how the UAW will fit into [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=20.88s)]
*  automakers' plans to build more and more EVs. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=25.44s)]
*  And whether the workers who make these will become unionised. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  This union is really fighting over positions that aren't made yet. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=31.44s)]
*  So what do America's EV and battery ambitions mean for the future of the UAW? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=35.28s)]
*  Let's find out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=39.92s)]
*  I'm a worker's union! [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=41.84s)]
*  I'm a worker's union! [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=43.6s)]
*  So this is the first time in the UAW's almost 90-year history that the group has gone on strike [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=45.84s)]
*  at all three automakers at the same time. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=50.56s)]
*  Part of the UAW's demands have been for cost of living adjustments, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=53.12s)]
*  the right to strike over plant closures and a 40% pay rise over the next four years. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  And negotiations have been tricky. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=62.08s)]
*  So I'll tell you what I'm going to do with their proposal. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=64.0s)]
*  I'm going to file it in its proper place because that's where it belongs, the trash. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=65.92s)]
*  A lot of the tension has been around where the money for that 40% pay rise could come from. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=70.24s)]
*  And to help explain why, here's WSJ Auto's reporter, Nora Eckhart. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=74.64s)]
*  Okay, webcam. Sorry, George. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  I might need to get warmed up a little bit here. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=80.4s)]
*  This is coming at a time where the automakers are really focused on keeping costs lower, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=82.64s)]
*  they can, so that they can fund the transition to producing EVs. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=87.36s)]
*  Part of that expense is because the raw materials needed to make EVs can cost up to 125% more [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=92.08s)]
*  than those used in internal combustion engine or ICE vehicles. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=98.32s)]
*  But the union has said that the companies can afford their demands, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=101.68s)]
*  even as they're funneling billions of dollars into this EV transition. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=105.6s)]
*  When the big three say the future is uncertain and that the EV transition is expensive, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=109.92s)]
*  remember that they've made a quarter of a trillion in North American profits over the last decade. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=114.8s)]
*  But when it comes to EV manufacturing, the bigger concern for the UAW is around job security. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=119.84s)]
*  See, the transition from making gas cars to electric ones is dramatically reshaping [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=125.52s)]
*  how many auto workers are needed and what those roles are. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=129.6s)]
*  While tasks like installing interior trim or fitting seats are unlikely to change much in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=132.88s)]
*  the transition, roles that center around building the combustion engine are at risk. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=137.2s)]
*  According to congressional research, that could mean nearly 150,000 jobs are exposed. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=141.6s)]
*  And even Ford's own CEO, Jim Farley, once told a conference that EVs would require [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=146.32s)]
*  40% less labor than ICE vehicles. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=151.2s)]
*  But the automakers have assured workers that as many of those jobs will be transitioned as possible, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=153.6s)]
*  so they'll be moving folks over from these ICE plants to EV plants. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=159.04s)]
*  While jobs on combustion engine and transmission production lines are likely to be phased out, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=163.12s)]
*  new jobs in new battery manufacturing facilities will spring up. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=168.0s)]
*  But that could still present a major issue for the UAW. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=171.44s)]
*  The plan was to draw down engine and transmission plants [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=175.04s)]
*  and permanently replace them with low-wage battery jobs. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=178.24s)]
*  See, most of the new battery factories aren't 100% owned and operated by automakers. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=182.4s)]
*  They're joint ventures. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=187.68s)]
*  GM has a factory with LG and plans for two more. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  Ford has plans for several with SKON and Stellantis has teamed up with Samsung for its factories. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=192.32s)]
*  And the problem for the UAW is that these factories aren't automatically unionized. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=197.84s)]
*  And the union is fighting for the security of those future jobs, which is really interesting. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=202.72s)]
*  But that appears to be changing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=207.28s)]
*  In December 2022, the workers at LG and GM's battery facility voted to unionize. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=209.28s)]
*  And fast forward to the present day. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=214.64s)]
*  GM has now agreed in writing to place their electric battery manufacturing [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=216.64s)]
*  under our National Master Agreement. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  What this will mean for our membership cannot be understated. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  The question now is whether GM's agreement will set the stage for [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=229.92s)]
*  other automakers' battery facilities to follow suit. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=233.12s)]
*  If that happens, it could drive costs up for these automakers. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=235.92s)]
*  The average hourly labor costs for a unionized OEM is around $65 an hour, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=239.12s)]
*  according to Industry Data. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=243.76s)]
*  Whereas Tesla, which currently isn't unionized, has hourly labor costs of around $45 an hour. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=245.2s)]
*  And so if these automakers pay their workers union rates at their battery facilities, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=251.2s)]
*  it could make them less cost-competitive compared to the likes of Tesla or foreign [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  manufacturers like those in Asia. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  Throughout this whole bargaining process, the automakers have sort of repeated this mantra of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=262.56s)]
*  we cannot be competitive companies if our labor costs inflate as much as the union's demands would make them. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=267.44s)]
*  But if automakers don't come to an agreement with the UAW, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=273.84s)]
*  they may struggle to make vehicles altogether. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  I've heard members who want to bring down the hammer, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  strike all the truck plants, hit the big three where it hurts. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  And there is a time and place for that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=286.4s)]
*  And believe me, if the big three don't continue to make progress, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=288.0s)]
*  that time's going to be coming real soon. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  So even though the strikes have gone on for weeks, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=294.08s)]
*  this could just be the very beginning of a long road ahead for the UAW. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  you [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhh8s65lp4&t=303.84s)]
