# Why the VIX Keeps Investors on Edge  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 06, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc)
*  Here's the S&P 500 over the last year or so. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=0.0s)]
*  It looks pretty choppy. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=6.28s)]
*  But people who have been around it for a long time know it can get a lot choppier than this. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=8.74s)]
*  Here's the same index in 2008 during the financial crisis. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=13.96s)]
*  You can see the swings were a lot bigger back then. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=19.34s)]
*  Swings in stock prices are known as volatility. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=23.22s)]
*  Before the market crashed in 2008, casual observers of the market weren't really paying [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=26.36s)]
*  attention to it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=30.52s)]
*  But they do now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=31.52s)]
*  And that's because of this, the VIX, or the CBOE Volatility Index. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=33.36s)]
*  The VIX shot up during the financial crisis. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=38.96s)]
*  Since then, the VIX has been known as a warning signal for market distress. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=41.92s)]
*  But how does it work? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=48.0s)]
*  Like the name suggests, the VIX looks at volatility. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=57.24s)]
*  Specifically, it takes data about option trading and uses it to forecast the likely size of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=60.64s)]
*  coming market swings. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=66.12s)]
*  When the VIX is high, it means traders are expecting a shaky market. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=68.56s)]
*  And when it's low, it means they're expecting a relatively stable one. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=72.44s)]
*  Options grant investors the right to buy or sell a stock within a specific timeframe at [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=77.4s)]
*  a stated price. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=81.6s)]
*  They come in two types. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=83.52s)]
*  Calls and puts. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=85.28s)]
*  Call options grant the right to buy a stock at a stated price within the chosen timeframe. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=86.92s)]
*  Investors often buy them when they are confident that the stock will rise and want to lock [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=92.96s)]
*  in a lower price. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  Put options allow an investor to sell shares at a stated price within the chosen timeframe. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  Traders tend to buy them when they think stocks might decline and want to lock in a selling [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  price ahead of that drop. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=108.84s)]
*  Here's an example. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=111.8s)]
*  Let's say an investor owns company shares valued at $100 each. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=113.36s)]
*  If the investor thinks the stock might go down and wants to lock in earlier gains, they [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=117.32s)]
*  could purchase a put option that would give them the right to sell the shares for, say, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=121.48s)]
*  $85 at a later date. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=125.92s)]
*  The investor and the put seller make a deal. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=128.24s)]
*  The investor pays a small premium to purchase the options. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=131.0s)]
*  If the stock price drops below the strike price, in this case $85, the put seller must [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=135.24s)]
*  buy the stock for $85 a share. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=140.58s)]
*  This helps limit the shareholders' losses. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=143.46s)]
*  If the stock doesn't fall as low as $85 while the option is valid, the put expires [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=146.08s)]
*  worthless and the shareholder is out of the premium. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  This means the put seller made money on the deal. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=155.06s)]
*  So what does this have to do with the VIX? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=158.26000000000002s)]
*  The VIX is calculated based on the price of options on the S&P 500. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=162.10000000000002s)]
*  When traders worry the market will fall or are betting it will rise, they can buy put [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=166.7s)]
*  or call options to protect their assets or make money. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=171.01999999999998s)]
*  The increased demand drives up the price of these options, which in turn drives up the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=174.7s)]
*  VIX. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=178.98s)]
*  So here's the VIX now, and here it is in 2008, right before Lehman Brothers collapsed. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=180.22s)]
*  You can see option prices were high. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=186.26s)]
*  Investors betting that the volatility would persist were buying more calls and puts and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  driving up prices. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=193.57999999999998s)]
*  Now, people who watch the markets keep their eye on the VIX. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=195.5s)]
*  And as the VIX becomes a more popular way of gauging the stock market, investors have [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=199.38s)]
*  started betting on the VIX itself. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXMmQ7JgcWc&t=203.42s)]
