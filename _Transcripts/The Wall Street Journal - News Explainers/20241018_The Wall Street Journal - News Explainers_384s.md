# The Four Congressional Races That Will Decide the President’s Power  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ)
*  No tax on overtime. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=0.0s)]
*  A pathway to citizenship. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=2.58s)]
*  Take other countries' jobs. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=4.58s)]
*  Restore reproductive freedoms. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=6.58s)]
*  Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have made a lot of promises on the campaign trail. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=8.84s)]
*  The vast majority of these promises have at least one thing in common. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  They need to get through the U.S. Congress before becoming the law of the land. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=16.52s)]
*  And right now, the high-stakes fight to control the Senate and the House remains a toss-up. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=20.62s)]
*  Things like the economy, abortion, immigration are important to a lot of voters. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=25.66s)]
*  And all of those items, in one way, shape, or form, are likely to be on Congress' agenda in 2025. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=30.9s)]
*  This is a breakdown of the House and the Senate ahead of the 2024 election. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=37.7s)]
*  Republicans control the House and Democrats control the Senate, meaning we have a divided Congress. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=42.1s)]
*  We live in a time where we're constantly veering from threatened government shutdown [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=47.5s)]
*  to threaten government shutdown and which party controls the House and the Senate [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=51.94s)]
*  has consequences for how that process unfolds. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=56.059999999999995s)]
*  The margins for either party to take control of both chambers of Congress remain pretty slim, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=59.059999999999995s)]
*  so any tight race could tip the scales. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=64.24s)]
*  There are currently three vacant seats in the House. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  Democrats are expected to pick up two of those, and the remaining seat is expected to be Republican. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=69.36s)]
*  But Democrats would still need to flip four additional seats to win a majority. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=74.24s)]
*  In the Senate, Republicans only need to flip two seats to win a majority. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=79.12s)]
*  With West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin retiring this year, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=83.08s)]
*  it's all but certain that a Republican will take his place, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=86.8s)]
*  meaning Republicans really only need to win one Senate seat. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=90.14s)]
*  One state that could determine the future of the Senate is Montana. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  Democratic Senator John Tester is up for reelection and facing a challenge by Tim Sheehy, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=98.1s)]
*  a Trump-endorsed Republican and former Navy SEAL. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=103.0s)]
*  Tester is a three-term incumbent, but he's serving a state that favors Trump and leans sharply red. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=106.24s)]
*  —Montanans have been totally clear with me. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=112.08s)]
*  We need to return American strength to Washington, D.C. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  In the 2020 presidential election, Trump won the state by 16 percentage points. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  And Republicans have swept all other statewide offices and secured a supermajority in the legislature. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  —Voters are increasingly more tribal. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  So they really are understanding, hey, if I want Donald Trump as president, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=130.44s)]
*  I need to bring him a Republican Senate. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=135.04s)]
*  —Tester, he's really sort of running an uphill battle structurally [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=137.24s)]
*  against a solid Republican candidate in a state that's solidly Republican. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=141.2s)]
*  Democrats have poured tens of millions of dollars into campaign spending and advertising for Tester, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=145.6s)]
*  selling the message that he's a centrist politician who can work with Trump. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=151.4s)]
*  —I'm protecting our freedoms because Montanans don't like to be told how to live by anyone, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=155.04s)]
*  especially the government. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=160.28s)]
*  —While Republicans gain momentum in Montana, Democrats are making headway in the Senate race in Texas. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=162.48s)]
*  Republican Senator Ted Cruz is seeking a third term, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  but Democratic Representative Colin Allred is standing in his way. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=170.96s)]
*  —Democrats see changing demographics in Texas, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=175.12s)]
*  and they have gotten increasingly hopeful that they can win a statewide race. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=178.96s)]
*  —Allred is campaigning on centrist policies, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=183.0s)]
*  talking tough on border security while also backing abortion rights [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=185.88s)]
*  in an effort to appeal to a wider swath of voters. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=189.64s)]
*  —I stood up to Joe Biden on the border, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=192.55999999999997s)]
*  and to extremists like Ted Cruz who prefer chaos to real solutions. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=194.67999999999998s)]
*  —Cruz straddles the line between conservative warrior and bipartisan legislator [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=199.16s)]
*  as he tries to maintain his base while also appealing to suburban swing voters. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=203.64s)]
*  —It's all about turning Texans out to keep Texas Texas. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=208.27999999999997s)]
*  —If you don't want a far-right, firebrand conservative, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  Ted Cruz is not your man. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=216.92s)]
*  So do you start going and looking at Colin Allred, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  who is talking about having a strong, secure border? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=221.64s)]
*  —Since entering the race, Allred has outraised and outspent Cruz. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  But this isn't the first time Cruz has faced a tough challenge by a Democrat. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=230.0s)]
*  During the 2018 midterms, then-Representative Beto O'Rourke [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=233.72s)]
*  pulled similarly to how Allred pulls now. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  He lost to Cruz, but only by a slim margin. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  —Texas is still a challenge for Democrats. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  —When Cruz last ran for reelection in 2018, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=244.92s)]
*  that was a presidential midterm year. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=247.39999999999998s)]
*  It was a year that Democrats did very well nationwide. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=249.16s)]
*  People were very energized by the idea of getting out to vote [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=252.16s)]
*  against the party of President Trump. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=256.68s)]
*  —Now let's look at the House. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=260.08s)]
*  All 435 seats are up for reelection in 2024. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=261.44s)]
*  But Democrats only need to win a net of four seats in the House to take the majority. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=265.4s)]
*  And right now, there are multiple contentious races in California and New York. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=269.76s)]
*  —They are really targeting districts where Biden won in 2020, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=274.48s)]
*  but a Republican won those seats in 2022. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=279.16s)]
*  And Democrats see those as their prime pickup locations. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=281.96000000000004s)]
*  Republicans, that's where they have to defend the most. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=285.6s)]
*  —The House Democrats' campaign arm had around $87 million at the end of August, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=288.6s)]
*  roughly $16 million more than the Republicans' group. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  —Abortion was a big issue in the 22 election. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=297.16s)]
*  It has continued to be a big issue since then. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=299.8s)]
*  And so in a lot of these districts where the voters might be somewhat more moderate, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  if they see reproductive rights as more under threat, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=307.36s)]
*  you could also imagine that shaping folks' decisions. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=309.72s)]
*  —There are multiple significant policy decisions on the 2025 legislative agenda [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=312.76s)]
*  that have to be addressed. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=317.16s)]
*  And whichever party is in the majority will have a huge say in their outcome. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=318.76s)]
*  —A big item on the agenda of the new Congress and the new president [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  is going to be what to do about the expiration of the Trump tax cuts. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=328.16s)]
*  On abortion, one of the big questions that people have about what would happen [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=332.24s)]
*  if Republicans have unified party control [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=336.2s)]
*  is would they try to legislate a nationwide abortion ban? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=338.68s)]
*  Exactly how that process unfolds, what it looks like, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=341.96s)]
*  is going to be affected by the exact balance of power, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=345.76s)]
*  which parties have majorities in the two chambers, who's in the White House. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  —But it's not just these states that could influence [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=352.64s)]
*  who will take control of the House and the Senate. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=354.64s)]
*  —Any race has the potential to remake the next Congress of the United States. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=357.12s)]
*  —There are a number of other competitive Senate races [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=361.32s)]
*  in places like Arizona and Pennsylvania. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=364.32s)]
*  And then in the House, given just how narrow control of the House [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=367.28s)]
*  is right now for Republicans, really any one of those races, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=370.88s)]
*  whether it's in New York, California, or another state, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=374.32s)]
*  could be what determines which party has a majority in the House. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoNYcHKT1sQ&t=376.79999999999995s)]
