# Stimulus Checks Alone May Not Spur Inflation. Here’s What Could  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 24, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8)
*  Millions of Americans are receiving stimulus checks worth up to $1400 each. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=0.0s)]
*  You might be one of them. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=6.0s)]
*  It's all part of President Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=7.0s)]
*  The American Rescue Plan is already doing what it was designed to do. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=12.0s)]
*  Make a difference in people's everyday lives. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=16.0s)]
*  But you might have also heard people say that if all that money gets spent, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=19.0s)]
*  the economy will overheat and we'll get inflation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=23.0s)]
*  In this video, we'll answer the question of whether stimulus checks will lead to inflation. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=26.0s)]
*  Short answer, it could, but not necessarily. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=30.0s)]
*  And the reason is that the link between stimulus checks and inflation isn't direct. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=34.0s)]
*  There's a lot of other things going on at the same time. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=38.0s)]
*  First of all, not all of the checks are going to be spent. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=48.0s)]
*  Some people who didn't lose their jobs and are doing pretty well will save them money instead. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=51.0s)]
*  You know, put it in their 401k. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=55.0s)]
*  Or they'll use the money to pay off their credit card bills or other debts. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=57.0s)]
*  So if that money doesn't get spent, then it won't generate economic activity [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=61.0s)]
*  and it therefore will not cause any inflation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=65.0s)]
*  However, some people will spend the checks. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=68.0s)]
*  Perhaps on new furniture or a car or on a trip. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=70.0s)]
*  Or they could use it to pay more for their rent or groceries. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=73.0s)]
*  And remember, this isn't the only spending going on. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=76.0s)]
*  There's also billions of dollars being sent out by the federal government [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=79.0s)]
*  as additional unemployment insurance. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=83.0s)]
*  They're also sending out money for state and local governments. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=85.0s)]
*  There's money being sent out to help small businesses hold onto or hire workers. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=88.0s)]
*  Also, people have a lot of savings stored up from last year's stimulus bills as well. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=92.0s)]
*  And they're just waiting for the virus to end and for businesses to reopen [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=97.0s)]
*  so they can go out and spend that money. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=101.0s)]
*  And when that happens, businesses will need to go out and hire back a lot of the workers who got laid off last year. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=103.0s)]
*  So there will be a lot of spending and hiring going on, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=110.0s)]
*  not just because of the stimulus checks, but for other reasons too. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=113.0s)]
*  But will that be enough to overheat the economy? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=117.0s)]
*  Let's step back for a moment and ask how overheating takes place. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=120.0s)]
*  Inflation happens when the demand for goods and services runs ahead of the economy's capacity [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=124.0s)]
*  to supply those goods and services with its current labor force. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=130.0s)]
*  Think of the economy's capacity like a container. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=134.0s)]
*  Demand is like water going into that container. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=137.0s)]
*  If people go out and spend their stimulus checks, that starts to fill up the container. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=140.0s)]
*  Businesses go out and hire workers who go out and spend their paychecks. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=145.0s)]
*  And that also helps to fill the container. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=149.0s)]
*  But there's millions of workers out of a job, thousands of businesses that are idle. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=152.0s)]
*  So we could have lots of spending and lots of hiring without the economy running out of capacity [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=156.0s)]
*  or the container filling up with water. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=161.0s)]
*  Not until the container overflows do you get inflation. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=163.0s)]
*  Now you may have noticed that the prices for some things are already going up [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=168.0s)]
*  for airline tickets and gasoline and lumber. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=171.0s)]
*  That's not really inflation. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=174.0s)]
*  Inflation is when most prices are going up, not just a few, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=176.0s)]
*  and when they're going up year after year. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=179.0s)]
*  What you're seeing right now are just one-time only price increases [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=182.0s)]
*  in industries that have specific bottlenecks. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=186.0s)]
*  So right now the stimulus checks are probably not going to cause inflation. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=189.0s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=193.0s)]
*  Remember what I said about the economy being like a container? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=194.0s)]
*  Well, the container is still a long way from being full. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=197.0s)]
*  There are more than 9 million fewer people with jobs now than before the pandemic. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=200.0s)]
*  It's a lot of slack in the labor market, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=205.0s)]
*  and it's going to take a lot of spending, a lot of hiring over many, many months [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=207.0s)]
*  before we start to run out of money. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=211.0s)]
*  So the economy is going to be like a container. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=213.0s)]
*  We might run the water long enough to fill the container [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=216.0s)]
*  and discover that the container has stretched and gotten bigger. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=219.0s)]
*  In other words, we may think we can only get the unemployment rate down to say 4%, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=222.0s)]
*  and then we'll run out of workers. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=227.0s)]
*  But maybe as unemployment goes down, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=229.0s)]
*  we'll find a lot more people coming into the labor force to look for jobs. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=231.0s)]
*  One thing that's going to be a lot of work for us is to get the unemployment rate down to 4%. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=235.0s)]
*  And that's going to be a lot of work for us. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=240.0s)]
*  One final point. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=242.0s)]
*  Inflation is partly psychological. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=244.0s)]
*  Businesses are more likely to raise prices and wages if they think everyone else will do the same thing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=246.0s)]
*  In other words, if they expect higher inflation, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=252.0s)]
*  they'll act in a way that makes higher inflation more likely. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=255.0s)]
*  But inflation has been low for years. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=259.0s)]
*  In fact, it's too low. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=261.0s)]
*  The Federal Reserve targets 2%, which they think is ideal. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=263.0s)]
*  Inflation has been so low for so long, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=266.0s)]
*  people will assume it will stay that way. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=268.0s)]
*  So I just explained why the stimulus checks aren't likely to produce inflation soon. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=270.0s)]
*  But maybe in a few years, we'll get inflation. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=274.0s)]
*  How would that happen? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=277.0s)]
*  Well, if we succeed in vaccinating most of the country, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=279.0s)]
*  the virus will go away and most of the economy will reopen. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=282.0s)]
*  So people will start spending again big time. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=285.0s)]
*  And maybe those stimulus checks won't be the last of the stimulus. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=288.0s)]
*  President Trump has said that the stimulus checks will be the last of the stimulus. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=291.0s)]
*  President Biden is talking about a big infrastructure package. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=296.0s)]
*  It not only creates jobs, but it makes us a whole lot more competitive [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=299.0s)]
*  around the world if we have the best infrastructure in the world. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=304.0s)]
*  So in a year or two, unemployment could fall close to 3% for the first time in half a century. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=307.0s)]
*  That would look like a labor market that has run out of slack. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=312.0s)]
*  Like the container has started to overflow. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=315.0s)]
*  There's one important reason why we haven't had high inflation in a long time. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=325.0s)]
*  The Federal Reserve didn't let it happen. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=329.0s)]
*  As soon as it thought the economy was overheating because unemployment was low, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=331.0s)]
*  it raised interest rates. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=335.0s)]
*  And often that put us into a recession. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=337.0s)]
*  But Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Fed, says this time is different. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=339.0s)]
*  Because inflation has been below 2% for so long, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=344.0s)]
*  Powell wants inflation to actually go above 2% for a while. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=347.0s)]
*  That's why he's keeping interest rates at zero. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=351.0s)]
*  That's why he plans to keep them close to zero until 2024 at least. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=353.0s)]
*  We're not done and I'd hate to see us take our eye off the ball before we actually finish the job. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=357.0s)]
*  There's another thing that's different. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=362.0s)]
*  For a long time, all the politicians and the experts said keeping inflation low should be the priority. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=364.0s)]
*  Not any longer. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=369.0s)]
*  Now presidents, Congress, and the Fed say low unemployment, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=371.0s)]
*  especially for disadvantaged groups, is more important. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=374.0s)]
*  So even if inflation starts to look like a problem, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=376.0s)]
*  maybe the Fed will be reluctant to raise interest rates. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=379.0s)]
*  Also those stimulus checks? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=382.0s)]
*  That's not really free money. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=384.0s)]
*  The government borrowed it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=386.0s)]
*  And as a result, the national debt is sky high. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=388.0s)]
*  If the Fed raised interest rates to fight inflation, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=390.0s)]
*  paying the interest on that debt quickly gets very expensive. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=393.0s)]
*  So if the Fed ever decides it needs to raise interest rates, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=397.0s)]
*  there will be a lot of politicians hoping it doesn't. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=400.0s)]
*  And maybe pressuring it not to. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKNf106zqq8&t=403.0s)]
