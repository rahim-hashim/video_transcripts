# Bed Bath & Beyond’s Potential Bankruptcy, Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY)
*  Each of these pins is a Bed Bath & Beyond that closed in 2022. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=0.0s)]
*  That's about 20 percent of its stores. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=5.28s)]
*  Shares are at their lowest point since [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=7.86s)]
*  the 90s after the company said it's facing bankruptcy. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=10.08s)]
*  Bankruptcy. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=13.44s)]
*  Bankruptcy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  As sales collapsed, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=15.1s)]
*  Bed Bath & Beyond scrambled to cut costs by laying off workers and closing those stores. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=16.44s)]
*  Here's what happened to the home goods chain in the last six months that led to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=22.6s)]
*  a cash crisis and a potential bankruptcy filing. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=26.88s)]
*  Let's turn back the clock to June when Bed Bath & Beyond CEO Mark Tritton had a problem. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=31.08s)]
*  His strategy of scaling back coupons and doing away with [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=37.0s)]
*  popular national brands in favor of private labels was failing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=40.76s)]
*  These are some of my favorites from the Haven line. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  The company was struggling to stock shelves [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=47.08s)]
*  since it had fallen behind on payments to vendors. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=49.28s)]
*  Sales had fallen by 25 percent compared to the previous year, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=52.28s)]
*  and net losses were up to over $350 million. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=56.16s)]
*  On June 29th, the company announced a leadership change. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=59.12s)]
*  Sue Gove has been named interim chief executive officer, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=64.28s)]
*  replacing Mark Tritton, who is leaving the company. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=68.44s)]
*  At the time, Gove said that Bed Bath & Beyond's [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=71.72s)]
*  Results are not up to our expectations, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=74.72s)]
*  nor are they reflective of our potential. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  It was not entirely surprising because the company had reported a string of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=80.32s)]
*  poor earnings and falling sales. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=85.36s)]
*  And so it was well known that the company was struggling. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=88.16s)]
*  In August, cash reserves, key for paying vendors, were still low. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=92.08s)]
*  The company needed more cash and was looking for a loan to make that happen. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=97.04s)]
*  On the 23rd, Bed Bath & Beyond announced it had secured $500 million in funding, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  which it hoped would help keep shelves stocked. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=107.12s)]
*  Some vendors had not been paid in months, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  and clearly the company was struggling. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  While the loan could pay for more inventory, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=115.28s)]
*  it wasn't enough to keep every store open. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=117.64s)]
*  Bed Bath & Beyond announced it'd be closing 150 locations, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=120.56s)]
*  about 20 percent of its doors. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=124.36000000000001s)]
*  Plus, it would be starting layoffs that amounted to a fifth of its corporate and supply chain staff. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=126.64s)]
*  Just two days later, the company suffered a different kind of loss. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=132.44s)]
*  CFO Gustavo Arnal died by suicide. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=137.08s)]
*  At a time when a company is struggling financially to lose your CFO, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=141.16s)]
*  that like that is, you know, is certainly a shock and certainly made things even more difficult for them. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=145.16s)]
*  When second quarter earnings were released at the end of September, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  analysts said the company was facing yet another cash crunch. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=154.68s)]
*  The $500 million loan had weakened Bed Bath & Beyond's balance sheet with liabilities exceeding assets. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=158.68s)]
*  Still, the company felt [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=165.56s)]
*  confident that our current liquidity will enable the necessary strategic plans we have implemented. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=167.28s)]
*  But a few weeks later, Bed Bath & Beyond announced it'd be making a debt exchange offer, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=173.84s)]
*  where a company exchanges bonds for secured notes to extend maturities and reduce interest expenses. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=178.68s)]
*  The company was offering higher interest rates in exchange for investors taking a haircut on their principal. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=185.48s)]
*  It meant note holders would lose money, but they'd be guaranteed something. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=190.96s)]
*  Stock prices dipped, then fell more after Gove hosted a summit with suppliers [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=195.48s)]
*  at the company's New Jersey headquarters to ask for support. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=200.28s)]
*  She had several challenges. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  One, suppliers, some of them had not been paid in months. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  And two, the company had pushed out some of these suppliers to make way for its private label brands. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=209.48s)]
*  Now it wanted the suppliers to come back. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=215.64s)]
*  Well, these suppliers had found other channels to sell their goods. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=217.44s)]
*  So it was taking a lot of convincing to get the suppliers back on board. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  And I'm not sure they were entirely successful. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=225.2s)]
*  These vendor woes were all happening before the busiest time of the year for retailers, the holiday season. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=227.76s)]
*  Bed Bath & Beyond was still struggling to stock shelves. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  Just a few days before Black Friday, reports came out that more than 40 percent of the retailer's products had been out of stock in October. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=237.92s)]
*  Some suppliers said they were still owed money and would pause shipments until they were paid. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=245.92s)]
*  If you have empty shelves, you're not going to have people coming in and buying and then you're not going to have sales. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=251.52s)]
*  And it becomes a vicious cycle. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=256.44s)]
*  Sales didn't meet expectations during the fourth quarter. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=258.32s)]
*  And on January 5th, Bed Bath & Beyond announced it was preparing to file for bankruptcy in just a few weeks. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=261.24s)]
*  A spokeswoman for Bed Bath & Beyond said it hadn't made any final decisions. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=268.08s)]
*  And Gove said on the third quarter earnings call, we are committed to updating all stakeholders of our plans as they develop and finalize. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=272.32s)]
*  In that earnings report, the company said sales fell 33 percent and losses rose to 393 million dollars. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  Our business was built around our loyal customers. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=289.36s)]
*  Listening and responding to their preferences was at the center. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=292.36s)]
*  Veering away from that path has led to our recent financial performance. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  The company also said it is planning more layoffs in an effort to cut costs. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=300.44s)]
*  Bankruptcy is still not a certainty, but their ability to avoid it is shrinking. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=305.36s)]
*  You know, there were things they could have done, such as sell their buy-buy baby chain for cash. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=310.4s)]
*  They chose not to do that. So their options are narrowing. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=314.79999999999995s)]
*  News of an official bankruptcy filing could come in the next few weeks. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxDz3zhXIjY&t=318.47999999999996s)]
