# ‘A Liquidity Problem’ Trump’s Options to Pay His $454M Penalty  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg)
*  Donald Trump is facing half a billion dollars in legal penalties, an amount that's growing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=0.0s)]
*  by tens of thousands every day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=5.38s)]
*  The judgment in his New York civil fraud trial represents one of the biggest tests of the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  former president's personal wealth in decades. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=13.1s)]
*  He is probably going to have to liquidate assets and I think it is going to put tremendous [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=16.4s)]
*  pressure on the Trump organization and there's a risk that it all begins to cascade. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=21.16s)]
*  And he's up against the clock. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  For now, he has until late March to come up with the funds. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=29.12s)]
*  Otherwise, the New York attorney general could begin to seize some of his assets. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=32.4s)]
*  On March 18th, Trump's lawyer said he has been unable to obtain a bond to guarantee [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=37.68s)]
*  payment despite negotiating with some of the largest charitors in the world. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=42.56s)]
*  So what options does Trump have to finance this mounting bill? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=47.96s)]
*  We asked Wall Street Journal editor Peter Grant to break down where the former president's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=54.08s)]
*  wealth stands today. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=58.4s)]
*  We've looked at his business for a long time and our best guess is that his net worth today [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=60.8s)]
*  is roughly around three billion dollars. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump is under a lot of stress right now but it doesn't compare with the kind of stress [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=68.84s)]
*  that he was facing during the recession of the early 90s. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=72.56s)]
*  In 1975 we had a recession but that was a picnic compared to this. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=75.84s)]
*  That was an absolute picnic. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  Just before that recession, he was a lot more ambitious in terms of his business goals and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=82.4s)]
*  he was buying assets right and left. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=87.72000000000001s)]
*  We got it out of time for you folks. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=89.92s)]
*  So we're going to really be a good competitor and I think it's going to be a lot of fun. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=92.48s)]
*  When the recession of the early 1990s hit, he couldn't pay his debts and his empire began [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=96.0s)]
*  to crumble. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=101.64000000000001s)]
*  He had to sell a lot of these assets but even more, he had to put some of his casinos in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=102.64000000000001s)]
*  Atlantic City into bankruptcy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=108.02000000000001s)]
*  He himself was on the brink of personal bankruptcy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  Trump managed to survive the recession and then changed his tactics. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=113.88s)]
*  He started to leverage more his name, his brand. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=118.72s)]
*  He would sell his brand to developers who would be building projects. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=122.52s)]
*  They'd put the Trump name on it but Trump wouldn't have the risk. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=126.92s)]
*  One of the things that Trump has done to shore up his balance sheet in recent years is sell [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=131.24s)]
*  assets. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=135.57999999999998s)]
*  Trump has numerous assets throughout the world. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=137.12s)]
*  They're primarily in the U.S., the ones he owns. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  Resorts, condos, hotels, and he has pretty big stakes in some big office buildings. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=144.32s)]
*  The Trump balance sheet today is much stronger than it used to be. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=152.64s)]
*  It has roughly $400 million of cash on it and he's deleveraged by about $300 million, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=156.68s)]
*  which puts him in the position of increasing leverage if he needs fast cash. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=162.76s)]
*  Those cash reserves are now in question as his legal troubles mount. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=168.42s)]
*  On February 16th, a New York judge ordered Trump to pay $355 million in penalties, plus [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=172.9s)]
*  another $100 million in interest, which will continue to grow by roughly $100,000 per day. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=179.44s)]
*  This comes after the judge found the former president fraudulently valued parts of his [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=186.68s)]
*  real estate empire to secure more favorable loans. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=190.86s)]
*  The case is a complete and total sham. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=195.08s)]
*  It's a sham case. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=197.74s)]
*  There's a liquidity problem fundamental to all of this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=199.44s)]
*  The likelihood that somebody has $450 million sitting around just is not possible. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=203.42s)]
*  Trump appealed the ruling, but for it to move forward, he must secure the financing for [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=211.04s)]
*  what might be the full amount of his penalty. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=215.5s)]
*  In late February, an appeals judge rejected an offer from Trump's lawyers to post a $100 [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=218.17999999999998s)]
*  million bond rather than the full amount. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=223.76s)]
*  That decision is under review by a panel of appellate judges. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=226.74s)]
*  Trump doesn't have too many options. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=231.26000000000002s)]
*  He could put up the entire amount in cash, but doing that isn't easy. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=233.02s)]
*  He can't deplete all his cash. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=237.3s)]
*  He needs a significant amount of cash to pay the bills, so he can't use all $400 million. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=239.42000000000002s)]
*  On the other hand, Trump could secure a bond that would guarantee payment if he were to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=245.22s)]
*  lose his appeal. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=249.10000000000002s)]
*  They're typically backed by cash, investments or other assets. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=250.10000000000002s)]
*  He could potentially borrow against those assets, come up with the cash and just use [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=254.92s)]
*  that cash for the bond. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=259.76s)]
*  The fees a company might charge for the bond could also prove costly. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=262.2s)]
*  It's like any other instance in which you're securing a line of credit of sorts, which is, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  there's going to be a negotiation over what they're going to charge you for this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  So I don't think this is, I don't think anybody thinks this is going to be an inexpensive bond. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=276.4s)]
*  Trump has until late March to post a bond. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=282.28s)]
*  But in a filing to a New York appeals court on March 18th, his lawyer said he has faced [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=285.28s)]
*  insurmountable difficulties and that a bond in the judgment's full amount is a practical [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=290.09999999999997s)]
*  impossibility. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=294.96s)]
*  We will seek judgment enforcement mechanisms in court and we will ask the judge to seize [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=296.76s)]
*  his assets. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=304.08s)]
*  The AG has no interest in keeping it quiet. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=305.11999999999995s)]
*  I think there is no question that if Trump is unable to secure the kind of undertaking [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=308.36s)]
*  that will allow him to stay the proceeding, this is game on for her. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=315.08000000000004s)]
*  Trump's lawyers have acknowledged he lacks the liquidity to cover the judgment. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=320.56s)]
*  If the court doesn't intervene, they said that he might be forced to unload his prized [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=324.88s)]
*  real estate in a fire sale. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=329.32s)]
*  He has three ways to pay off the judgment without selling assets. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=332.0s)]
*  One would be through the available cash. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=337.42s)]
*  Two would be borrowing against the assets. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=339.7s)]
*  And three would be borrowing money from friends. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=342.78000000000003s)]
*  The worst case scenario would be for him to start selling assets. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=345.66s)]
*  He'd have to sell them quickly. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=349.94s)]
*  Buyers would have the potential of taking advantage of the situation and he wouldn't [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=352.5s)]
*  get the kind of prices that he would hope for. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=357.26s)]
*  So that would be certainly a bad scenario for him. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=359.78000000000003s)]
*  Even though some of these properties may be viewed as iconic properties, they may be [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=363.98s)]
*  worth a lot of money. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=367.5s)]
*  There aren't a lot of people who are willing to spend that kind of money. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=368.5s)]
*  A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to questions over how he plans to finance the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=372.18s)]
*  judgment. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=376.58000000000004s)]
*  His lawyers said in the March 18 court filing that obtaining cash through a fire sale of [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=377.66s)]
*  his real estate would result in irrecoverable losses. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=382.58000000000004s)]
*  Trump cleared one financial hurdle for a separate case on March 8 when he secured a nearly $92 [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=387.22s)]
*  million bond to guarantee a defamation judgment he owes to writer Eugene Carroll. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=393.66s)]
*  In the meantime, Trump's legal team has been focused on its appeal efforts. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=398.06s)]
*  It's possible those proceedings could last a year or more. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=402.42s)]
*  Were he to win the appeal, and in this instance let's assume win means the entire conviction [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=406.06s)]
*  is vacated, then none of this matters. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=413.26000000000005s)]
*  The only thing he would actually be out at this point other than legal fees would be [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=416.38s)]
*  the cost of the bond. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=421.14000000000004s)]
*  The other piece that you always have to remember is these numbers aren't ever going down, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=422.58s)]
*  they're going up and up and up. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=425.65999999999997s)]
*  And they will continue to go up until the appeal is exhausted. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=427.94s)]
*  So assuming Donald Trump does not win on appeal, the number that we're going to see at the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=432.9s)]
*  end of this is going to be significantly larger than the number we see now. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=438.52s)]
*  And again, we're going to be right back here where we are today. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eZcLR5ztg&t=443.21999999999997s)]
