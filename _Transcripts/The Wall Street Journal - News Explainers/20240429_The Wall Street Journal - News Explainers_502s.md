Video Description: Colleges and universities need a lot of money to operate—and how they get that money is complicated as wealth disparity in higher education is massive. Five schools—Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Princeton and the University of Texas—make up a quarter of the U.S.’s 839 billion endowment dollars. So how do smaller institutions afford to stay afloat?

Former Northwestern President Morton Schapiro breaks down the finances and shows how university funding has changed in the last few years and what that change means for the future.

# Former College President Explains the Funding Strategies Behind Universities | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s)
*  Columbia University alumnus Robert Kraft says he's not comfortable supporting the school. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=0.0s)]
*  Are you still supporting Harvard financially? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=5.64s)]
*  No. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=9.8s)]
*  These are just some of the many wealthy donors who have threatened to pull support from [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=10.68s)]
*  universities over mounting pro-Palestinian protests in the last several months. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=15.24s)]
*  But those large donations aren't the only thing keeping schools running. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=21.28s)]
*  This idea that university trustees and university administrators are going to say, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=25.52s)]
*  oh my God, I'm going to change my strategic vision because I'm worried about a $25 million gift [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  when you have $50 billion in the bank. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=36.44s)]
*  It's ludicrous. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=38.8s)]
*  To explain how colleges stay afloat, we asked former university president Morton Shapiro [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  to break down the finances of three schools with different revenue sources and what [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  changes mean for the future of higher ed. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  Having a large endowment really helps. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=55.44s)]
*  And I've been really fortunate to be president of two institutions with very large endowments. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  Endowments are big funds typically collected through donations and invested. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  You only take enough of it so that you can support what the donor wants, but you leave [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  it to be invested and invested. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=73.52s)]
*  So the endowment is an investment in the future. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=74.84s)]
*  In 2023, Northwestern took about $674 million from its endowment, or about 5 percent, which [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=78.39999999999999s)]
*  is the standard amount schools take from their endowments every year. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  There's nothing magical about the 5 percent. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=89.36s)]
*  You know, if you go much above that, you're probably going to erode the real value of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=91.64s)]
*  the endowment. If you go much below it, then it's unfair to the current generation of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  faculty, students and staff. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=100.64s)]
*  When things are really bad, I think you should take a higher percentage. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  That standard 5 percent of Northwestern's endowment made up more than a fifth of the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=106.27999999999999s)]
*  school's operating revenue in 2023. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=111.16s)]
*  When you have the kind of wealth that Northwestern and its peers have, that gives you a lot of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=113.88s)]
*  flexibility. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  Schools with large endowments depend less on other slices of the revenue pie, like [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=119.55999999999999s)]
*  tuition or private gifts. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  You can support study abroad activities and you can support all kinds of internships. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=126.88s)]
*  The endowment per student speaks powerfully to what the life experience is going to be [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=132.44s)]
*  once you're on campus. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=136.92s)]
*  It also speaks to the range of students who are likely to be on that campus. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=138.12s)]
*  The socioeconomic diversity of the undergrads at Northwestern and like many peer institutions, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=142.72s)]
*  much greater than it was. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=148.72s)]
*  Even while I was president, I started in 2009. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=150.24s)]
*  In 2020, only about 16 percent of students at private nonprofit universities paid full [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=153.32s)]
*  price. That's down from 29 percent in 1996. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=159.16s)]
*  That's partly due to those ballooning endowment funds. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  Northwestern's has grown more than six times since 2001. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=167.12s)]
*  The endowment grows because of equity markets, you know, stocks and also private equity [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=171.2s)]
*  investments. The returns have been spectacular. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  But a lot of that wealth is concentrated in just a few schools in the U.S. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=180.44s)]
*  If you don't have a large endowment, you're going to be much more conscious about attracting [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=185.28s)]
*  students, in many cases, undergrads who can pay the sticker price. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=190.0s)]
*  Private colleges, they are not getting state support. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=193.72s)]
*  So where are they getting their money? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=197.28s)]
*  The rest is mainly tuition. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  Like at Hamilton College in upstate New York, where tuition made up almost 60 percent of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=200.60000000000002s)]
*  operating revenues in 2023. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=205.84s)]
*  Despite Hamilton's large $1.3 billion endowment, that high percentage makes it a little [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=208.24s)]
*  bit more vulnerable to changes in the market. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=214.84s)]
*  You better make sure you're going to continue to be able to get the students and, you know, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=218.32s)]
*  fill the dorms and get a substantial proportion of them paying at least close to the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=222.32s)]
*  sticker price. Hamilton said in a statement that the school admits students without regard [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  to financial need and that the school is fortunate to support need blind admission. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=232.44s)]
*  But there are plenty of schools even more dependent on tuition than Hamilton. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=237.36s)]
*  Small schools that really are almost completely relying on net tuition revenues from [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=241.96s)]
*  undergrads are increasingly need aware. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=246.84s)]
*  You know, they're not going to admit a lot of students from needy families because they're [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=248.84s)]
*  not going to give enough need-based aid to make it possible for them to come. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=254.48s)]
*  So they don't admit them because if you admit them, their yield is low and your admit rate is [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=258.8s)]
*  very high and you don't look at selective. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=262.48s)]
*  And there's also a looming threat. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=264.32s)]
*  They look at the demographic cliff that's about to hit. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=266.8s)]
*  The number of high school graduates is going to go down substantially, we expect, over [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=270.16s)]
*  the next couple of decades. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=275.20000000000005s)]
*  This enrollment cliff is in part because of a decline in birth rates since the Great [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=276.68s)]
*  Recession. The vast majority of undergrads in this country go to a campus within 50 [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  miles of where they graduate high school. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  There's no cliff in a lot of the Sunvale, but there's a really precipitous cliff in other [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=289.76000000000005s)]
*  places, Rustbell, New England, et cetera. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=294.28s)]
*  You know, Hamilton again has an international draw that's going to protect it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=296.76s)]
*  But there are a lot of other liberal arts colleges who draw much more locally and it's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  going to be a real struggle for them once this cliff is realized. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=304.76s)]
*  When you talk about being tuition dependent, it's always said in a negative way. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=308.44s)]
*  Is there anything positive? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=312.88s)]
*  I think you focus more on your undergraduate experience. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=314.4s)]
*  Smaller private schools aren't the only ones increasingly dependent on their students to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=317.35999999999996s)]
*  pay the bills. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=322.11999999999995s)]
*  State operating subsidies or state appropriations to publics has really plummeted as a [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=323.28s)]
*  share of their operating budgets. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=328.28s)]
*  So that's really been devastating. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=330.32s)]
*  The University of California system, which consists of 10 schools throughout the state, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=332.56s)]
*  got more than 4 billion of state funding in 2023. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=337.52s)]
*  In 2001, state funding made up nearly 20 percent of revenues in the University of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=341.04s)]
*  California system. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  By 2023, it was less than 10 percent. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=347.04s)]
*  They still get some chunk of change from the state, but boy, have they taken a hit. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=350.52s)]
*  Now, it's been pretty flat in the last 12 years or so, 14 years, but they haven't made [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=356.52s)]
*  up for this precipitous decline. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=362.55999999999995s)]
*  Why? Because states have had a lot of financial troubles. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=364.79999999999995s)]
*  It's not that the state of California is not really proud to have the greatest higher [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  education system in the history of the world. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=373.28s)]
*  They just can't afford to fund it the way they used to. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=375.47999999999996s)]
*  But schools need to make up for that loss in funding. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  A lot of publics have tried to go into what the privates have long done, generate money [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=380.72s)]
*  from your undergrads. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  Since 2001, average undergraduate tuition for its in-state students has increased more [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=388.24s)]
*  than four times at the University of California, and it has more than tripled for [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=393.88s)]
*  out-of-state students. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=398.76s)]
*  It also means that a lot of these public universities need to fill their seats in the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=400.16s)]
*  classrooms and beds in the dorms with people out of state where they can charge full [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=406.8s)]
*  price. The estimated average total cost to attend the University of California is about [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  $38,000 in 2024, if you're a resident of the state. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=417.56s)]
*  If not, the cost nearly doubles to around $72,000. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=421.92s)]
*  But as seats become more competitive, California approved a plan to cap the number of [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=427.24s)]
*  out-of-state students UC schools can admit and compensate them for the lost income. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=432.32s)]
*  Now, tuition and fees make up about 11 percent of the UC system's revenue, compared to [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=438.0s)]
*  around 6 percent in 2001. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=443.44s)]
*  In a statement, the University of California said that its world-class college degree is [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=445.84s)]
*  also one of the nation's most affordable, adding that the system has kept attendance [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=450.84s)]
*  costs relatively low and stable and added more than 26,000 additional California [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=455.4s)]
*  undergraduates since fall 2015. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=460.64s)]
*  They say privatize the public's. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=463.56s)]
*  But you know what that means? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=465.91999999999996s)]
*  It means raising undergraduate tuition levels without accompanied levels of financial aid [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=467.84s)]
*  so that it makes public's increasingly bastions of privilege. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRAfRu4ez_s&t=476.88s)]
