# How Global Trade Runs on U.S. Dollars  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 22, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U)
*  The U.S. dollar dominates global trade. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=0.0s)]
*  In 2019, some 88% of international transactions [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=3.6s)]
*  involved U.S. dollars. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=7.48s)]
*  No other currencies came close. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=9.48s)]
*  That gives the U.S. extraordinary power [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=12.08s)]
*  over nearly anyone who imports or exports [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=14.32s)]
*  anything, anywhere. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=17.48s)]
*  Commodities like oil, gold, and coffee [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=19.56s)]
*  are all priced in dollars, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=21.92s)]
*  regardless of where they come from. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=23.92s)]
*  But this clout has long frustrated America's rivals, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=25.92s)]
*  making them vulnerable to U.S. trade sanctions. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=29.08s)]
*  Here's how the global economy runs on the U.S. dollar [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  and why some countries are developing alternative systems [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=35.48s)]
*  that could chip away at the dollar's dominance. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=38.44s)]
*  The dollar came to dominate trade after World War II. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=41.96s)]
*  The U.S. was the biggest economy in the world. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=45.84s)]
*  Other countries were trying to rebuild, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  and the dollar, it was stable and plentiful. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=50.4s)]
*  In 1944, a conference of 44 nations [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=53.0s)]
*  agreed to peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=55.76s)]
*  while the dollar itself was pegged to gold. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=58.76s)]
*  As global trade grew, so did the use of the dollar [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=61.48s)]
*  to conduct the world's business. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=64.08s)]
*  Even after the United States [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  abandoned the gold standard in 1971, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=67.52s)]
*  the dollar remained the world's currency of choice. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=70.4s)]
*  The world has gotten used to doing business in dollars [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=73.32s)]
*  because it's just easier than doing business [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=75.44s)]
*  in any other currency. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=77.44s)]
*  The dollar is incredibly liquid, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=78.56s)]
*  meaning it's easy to buy and sell things [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=80.08s)]
*  all over the world. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=81.84s)]
*  The U.S. banking system is very efficient, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  and those things combine to make it cheaper for businesses [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=85.16s)]
*  to buy and sell in dollars. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=88.6s)]
*  Here's how a typical international transaction [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=90.44s)]
*  works in U.S. dollars. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=92.96s)]
*  A Canadian lumber company sells boards [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  to a French home builder. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=97.36s)]
*  The Buyers Bank in France and the Sellers Bank in Canada [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  settle the payment in dollars [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=102.56s)]
*  via correspondent banks in the United States. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=104.56s)]
*  These correspondent banks have accounts [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=107.8s)]
*  at the United States Federal Reserve. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=109.8s)]
*  The money is transferred seamlessly [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=112.0s)]
*  between these banks' Fed accounts [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=113.8s)]
*  because their status as correspondent banks [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=115.28s)]
*  means they're seen as safe counterparties. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=117.72s)]
*  The United States says the use of these correspondent banks [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=121.2s)]
*  means every transaction technically touches U.S. soil, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=124.24s)]
*  giving it legal jurisdiction [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=128.0s)]
*  and compelling foreign countries to abide by its laws [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=129.48s)]
*  on money laundering and corruption. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=132.24s)]
*  After 9-11, the U.S. used the power of the dollar [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=136.2s)]
*  to advance its foreign policy goals. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=138.72s)]
*  The idea was to cut out the sources of funding [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=141.16s)]
*  for terror organizations. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=143.84s)]
*  The U.S. used its control of the dollar [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=145.84s)]
*  to increase surveillance of global money flows [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  and curb financing toward bad actors. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=150.48s)]
*  It did this by imposing sanctions on its rivals. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  Under the system, if a business or country tries to trade [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=156.88s)]
*  with a sanctioned entity in dollars, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=159.88s)]
*  the U.S. has the power to cut off its access to U.S. currency. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=162.16s)]
*  But other countries have been building workarounds. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=165.96s)]
*  Some E.U. countries opposed the U.S. sanctions against Iran. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  These sanctions put in place after the U.S. withdrew [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=172.56s)]
*  from the Iranian nuclear deal in 2018, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=175.36s)]
*  included banning dollar transactions with Iranian banks. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=178.36s)]
*  As a result, the E.U. is developing a Euro-backed system [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=182.36s)]
*  that is designed to facilitate trade between Europe and Iran [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=185.52s)]
*  without sending money across borders. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=188.8s)]
*  The E.U. countries still in the Iran deal [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=191.28s)]
*  are trying to figure out a way to work around the U.S. system [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  so they can trade with Iran. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=197.12s)]
*  Now, that bothers the U.S., which is trying to exert [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  maximum pressure on the Iranian economy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=201.52s)]
*  India already has an alternative payment system in place [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=204.44s)]
*  that it's using to do business with Iran. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  According to a Wall Street Journal investigation, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=210.12s)]
*  it's been used to facilitate transactions [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=212.6s)]
*  with sanctioned Iranian entities. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=214.88s)]
*  But the United States is still exerting its influence [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=217.28s)]
*  in the Middle East through the power of the U.S. dollar. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  The dollar still dominates global trade. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=223.72s)]
*  You can see that in the standoff between the U.S. and Iraq. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=226.2s)]
*  Iraq says they want to throw U.S. troops out of the country. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=229.76s)]
*  The U.S. said, we'll cut you off from your dollars [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=232.24s)]
*  in the U.S. system. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  But in the future, it's not clear how strong [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=236.52s)]
*  that threat will remain as other countries chip away [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  at the power of the dollar. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=242.56s)]
*  If the power of the dollar falls, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=244.36s)]
*  it could hurt the United States' ability [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=246.72s)]
*  to control the global trading system. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsDwMGH5E8U&t=248.72s)]
