# How Airbnb Salvaged Its IPO  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 10, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw)
*  Airbnb will go public with an estimated market valuation of over $42 billion. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=0.0s)]
*  A remarkable feat when considering just eight months ago, the home sharing giant was in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=6.0s)]
*  crisis mode, with its business being crushed by the coronavirus pandemic. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=10.84s)]
*  From April to June 2020, revenue was down 72% as travel and bookings came to a virtual [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=15.88s)]
*  standstill worldwide. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=21.76s)]
*  Here's how Airbnb managed to pivot towards profitability during a global pandemic, and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=23.6s)]
*  how it might fare amongst continued travel restrictions and beyond. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=29.6s)]
*  When the pandemic struck in March, travel restrictions around the world sent Airbnb's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=35.72s)]
*  bookings and revenues into freefall. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=40.36s)]
*  Bookings in Europe alone went down 80%. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=42.64s)]
*  Airbnb was burning through its reserves and needed a swift infusion of cash. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  So its first lifeline was securing $2 billion in loans. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=50.46s)]
*  But these didn't come cheap. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=55.08s)]
*  So when the pandemic hit, Airbnb was bleeding through its cash reserves and it needed a [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=57.16s)]
*  swift infusion of cash. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  But the loan that they got came at a very steep interest rate. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=64.08s)]
*  And it was an interest rate of 11%, which is often associated with distressed assets. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=68.92s)]
*  At this point, Airbnb's valuation had fallen from $31 billion in 2017 to $18 billion in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=74.17999999999999s)]
*  April 2020. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  Despite this, Airbnb was still under pressure to go public by year's end. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=82.4s)]
*  Airbnb's CEO had toyed with the idea of going public for years, but he'd stopped short [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  of pulling the trigger. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=92.92s)]
*  Now, that was leading to some anxiety setting in among early investors and a handful of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=93.92s)]
*  employees who were set to lose their stock options next year. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=101.0s)]
*  Like many other companies during the pandemic, Airbnb dramatically reduced its costs to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  get by. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=110.84s)]
*  Costs that have grown significantly over the last few years. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=112.36s)]
*  Before the pandemic, Airbnb had expanded into new areas like transportation and media and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=116.56s)]
*  spent big on things like marketing and a new corporate headquarters, increasing the company's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=121.68s)]
*  total costs more than fivefold between 2015 and 2019. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=126.48s)]
*  So even before the pandemic, you had board members asking executives, hey, why are your [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=131.0s)]
*  costs so high? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=137.24s)]
*  Airbnb spent big to expand into all sorts of new areas. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=138.88s)]
*  It also spent big on a new corporate headquarters, and it typically spends heavily on things [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  like sales and marketing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  To alleviate its balance sheets, Airbnb cut big expenses, put many non-corporate projects [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=152.44s)]
*  on hold and laid off a quarter of its staff. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=157.2s)]
*  They early on said that their founders wouldn't take a salary. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=160.83999999999997s)]
*  They cut pay in half for top executives. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  They slashed sales and marketing expenses, but it still wasn't enough. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=167.76s)]
*  We spoke to CEO Brian Chesky and he said he went through his accounts line by line [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=173.04s)]
*  to see what could be cut. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=181.0s)]
*  But none of Airbnb's maneuvers would work if people didn't start booking on its platform [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  again. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=187.84s)]
*  So the third move it made was to adapt its platform for pandemic travel. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=188.84s)]
*  People were sitting at home, they still wanted to travel, but they couldn't get onto a flight. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=193.12s)]
*  So what people start doing is that they start driving to smaller towns and cities. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=198.44s)]
*  And what do they do? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=203.44s)]
*  They book Airbnbs because big hotel chains don't have a footprint there. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=204.64s)]
*  So Airbnb gets lucky. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=209.76s)]
*  Before the pandemic, big cities visited by tourists had been Airbnb's strength. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=211.96s)]
*  But these new local stays and primarily suburban and rural locations became the company's focus. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=216.26s)]
*  CEO Brian Chesky sees this trend and immediately capitalizes on it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=221.84s)]
*  The company redesigned its website and its app. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=227.04s)]
*  So its algorithm would show prospective travelers everything from cabins to lavish beach houses [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  near where they lived. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=234.56s)]
*  By August, more than half of bookings were made for stays within 300 miles of guest location, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=236.2s)]
*  according to the company. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=241.95999999999998s)]
*  And these moves helped stem the losses and reservations. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=243.2s)]
*  The company reported a surprise profit in the third quarter. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=247.72s)]
*  This quarter is typically the most lucrative for the company, and Airbnb has turned a [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=251.45999999999998s)]
*  profit in that period every year since 2017. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=255.44000000000003s)]
*  Airbnb has never had a full year profit, but its turnaround during the global pandemic [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=259.2s)]
*  and at a time when the hotel industry is drowning, has buoyed investors' confidence and helped [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=263.8s)]
*  its valuation bounce back. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  One of Airbnb's near term challenges is, of course, the pandemic. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  What will that look like in the future? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=276.56s)]
*  How does travel change as a result of that? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=278.68s)]
*  Separately, the company has traditionally struggled to police crime on its platform, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=281.64s)]
*  and that is expected to get a lot more scrutiny as the company sells its shares to the public. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=288.44s)]
*  Skeptics wonder how long the company can keep costs down and stick to its core business. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=296.0s)]
*  And questions remain on whether the growth in revenue in bookings is sustainable, or [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=301.08s)]
*  whether Airbnb is simply the main beneficiary of a battered hospitality industry. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjA1cPPpw&t=305.76s)]
