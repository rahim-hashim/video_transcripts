# Apple vs. Banks: The Digital-Wallet War, Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU)
*  When you pay for your morning coffee, do you reach for this or this? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=0.0s)]
*  This is still what most people prefer, but digital wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  and PayPal have become more popular over the last several years, especially for online [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=11.76s)]
*  payments. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=17.56s)]
*  And that's making the banks whose cards are in your physical wallet worried. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=18.96s)]
*  As Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said about the growth of new financial technology in 2021, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=23.3s)]
*  Absolutely, we should be scared of this about that. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=28.4s)]
*  And Apple is one of big banks biggest threats. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  Here's how the tech company is encroaching on traditional finance's territory and how [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=34.56s)]
*  banks are gearing up to fight back. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=39.2s)]
*  We've created an entirely new payment process and we call it Apple Pay. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=42.64s)]
*  When Apple Pay was introduced in 2014, it wasn't the first digital wallet, but it had a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=52.24s)]
*  big advantage over its competitors, the iPhone. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=58.12s)]
*  And now Apple Pay is activated on 78 percent of iPhones in the U.S. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=61.48s)]
*  If you want to use an iPhone in store, it's very difficult to use a different wallet [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  like when you tap and pay at the register than Apple Pay. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=71.96s)]
*  It was also the only digital wallet that banks agreed to pay a fee for every transaction. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=74.88s)]
*  Here's why. Banks make money on debit and credit card purchases from interchange fees, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=80.52s)]
*  which merchants pay to the bank that issued your card when you shop with it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=86.19999999999999s)]
*  Those fees are usually one to three percent of your purchase when you shop with a credit [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  card. So if you buy that coffee for five dollars and your credit card has a roughly [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=94.24s)]
*  two percent interchange fee, the bank gets about 10 cents. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=99.36s)]
*  But if you use Apple Pay, the bank has to pay three quarters of a cent to Apple. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=103.88s)]
*  Rather than pocketing 10 cents on the five dollar transaction, the bank would instead [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=108.72s)]
*  keep just over nine cents. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=113.0s)]
*  On one small transaction, that doesn't seem like much. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  But it adds up. Apple took in an estimated seven hundred and eighty two million dollars [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=118.8s)]
*  from Apple Pay last year. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=123.92s)]
*  Initially, it was like, well, you know, better to be on board with this and have our cards [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=126.2s)]
*  used on Apple Pay then be cut out completely because if we don't play ball, what could [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=130.32s)]
*  happen? Could Apple develop some other mechanism that cuts out cards? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=134.4s)]
*  Fees Apple collects from Apple Pay only make up about one percent of the company's [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=138.4s)]
*  revenue from services. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=142.8s)]
*  That includes things like the App Store, Apple Music and iCloud. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=144.8s)]
*  But that number is growing. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=148.68s)]
*  It's estimated that the amount Apple Pay collected nearly doubled between 2020 and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  2022. But it's not just money that banks are losing to Apple. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  It's name recognition. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  It's not good enough for the banks to be the underlying card that's used on one of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=161.4s)]
*  these third party wallets. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=166.4s)]
*  Their concern is that once you lose that entire experience, it's just a slippery slope [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  from there where eventually you'll have a tech company that is actually the lender [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=172.64s)]
*  and they don't need you behind the scenes. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=178.0s)]
*  And Apple Pay isn't the end of Apple's ambitions with consumer payments. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  But we want to take the Apple Pay experience even further. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=185.27999999999997s)]
*  In 2019, it partnered with Goldman Sachs to create the Apple Card. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=189.32s)]
*  And in March, it began rolling out its own buy now pay later program. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=194.32s)]
*  Apple's subsidiary, Apple Financing LLC, will be the lender, effectively taking over [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  the role that many banks and other financial institutions would usually take. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  And now that consumers are getting used to engaging with Apple for their payments, it [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=209.16s)]
*  doesn't seem so far fetched, right, that consumers would be interested in engaging with [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=213.6s)]
*  Apple on a deposit account or some other type of payment mechanism. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=217.28s)]
*  And Apple's spokeswoman declined to comment. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=221.76s)]
*  But banks have also introduced their own new tech in the last few years. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=224.48s)]
*  Many have rolled out tap to pay cards with similar technology to your phone that makes [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=228.92s)]
*  it just as easy to check out in store. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=233.24s)]
*  Now they're preparing to compete with Apple in online payments, too, with a digital [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=235.76s)]
*  wallet of their own called Pays. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=240.24s)]
*  This is a very clear cut example where the banks have kind of had enough and are trying [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=242.96s)]
*  to figure out a very specific way to compete against Apple Pay and PayPal. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=248.12s)]
*  The new wallet will be operated by a company owned by these seven major banks. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=254.2s)]
*  Pays will allow customers to access eligible debit and credit cards by entering an email, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=258.76s)]
*  potentially speeding up the online checkout process. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=264.48s)]
*  Still, the banks will only succeed if people actually use it and merchants agree to accept [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=267.6s)]
*  it. After all, this isn't the first time banks have tried to launch their own digital [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=272.84s)]
*  wallets. Chase shut down its app Chase Pay in 2021, in part because of limitations with [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=277.0s)]
*  the iPhone, according to people familiar with the matter. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=283.16s)]
*  Talk about consumer behavior and shifting that behavior. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=286.44s)]
*  Right now, people are very used to paying with Apple Pay, with PayPal. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  There have been tons of wallets that have launched in different forums over the years [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=293.92s)]
*  and they fail. They fail to gain traction. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=298.36s)]
*  As banks try to compete with their own digital wallet, tech companies are trying to create [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  apps for more than just payments. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=305.8s)]
*  What is certain is that the battle between the banks and tech companies will continue, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=308.32000000000005s)]
*  period, until a winner emerges. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=312.6s)]
*  Everybody is convinced that there will eventually be a small number of super apps that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  control consumer payments and financial services. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=321.16s)]
*  So now they're basically duking it out to figure out who it's going to be. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjhVHcYbMU&t=324.24s)]
