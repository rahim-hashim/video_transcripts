# How Spy Balloons Became a Popular Aerial Surveillance Device | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY)
*  Alright, the balloon is gone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=0.0s)]
*  In February, the U.S. shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=2.0s)]
*  and three unidentified flying objects over North American airspace. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=5.68s)]
*  Though these airborne objects might seem like they came out of nowhere, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=9.68s)]
*  surveillance balloons have actually been around for centuries. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Here's a look at the history of spy balloons, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=16.48s)]
*  what's been used in the past, and why countries are still using them today. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=18.8s)]
*  The first recorded use of balloons for spying dates back to 1794, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=24.68s)]
*  when the French experimented with hydrogen-filled balloons [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=28.84s)]
*  during the French Revolutionary Wars. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=31.36s)]
*  The Battle of Fleurus was the first battle assisted by aerial observation. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=33.64s)]
*  About 60 years later, balloons made their debut in the U.S., [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=37.88s)]
*  where the Union and Confederate armies used them for aerial reconnaissance [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=41.6s)]
*  during the American Civil War. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=45.0s)]
*  These would normally be tethered to the ground. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=47.0s)]
*  The technology was essentially the human eye, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=49.08s)]
*  possibly aided with some binoculars. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=51.44s)]
*  One of the primary uses early in the war was just to see where enemy camps were, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=53.92s)]
*  where were they concentrating troops, how many troops were they moving. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=58.64s)]
*  This is Thomas Péon. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=61.72s)]
*  He's an exhibit curator at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=63.24s)]
*  aka a spy balloon expert. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=67.52s)]
*  That technology, that idea did continue, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=69.6s)]
*  and especially leading up to World War I, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=71.8s)]
*  where pretty much all of the combatants on both sides used observation balloons. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=74.08s)]
*  These balloons were linked to the ground by telephone wires, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=80.4s)]
*  which allowed them to direct artillery in real time. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=83.56s)]
*  They became highly prized to be shot down. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=86.2s)]
*  Also, as a result, became very heavily protected. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=89.16s)]
*  Both sides tended to ring their observation balloons [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=91.32s)]
*  with multiple anti-aircraft gun positions. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=93.8s)]
*  They often would have fighters that were located nearby [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=97.24s)]
*  to be sent up to protect them if enemy planes were coming to attack. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  Bringing death to some 5,000 men each day. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  Rigid airships, commonly referred to as dirigibles or zeppelins, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=110.72s)]
*  were introduced as a weapon of war in World War I. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=114.76s)]
*  They were powered by engines but steered with elevators and rudders. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=117.92s)]
*  These stretched over 500 feet long and could carry around 20 people, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=121.64s)]
*  their equipment, machine guns, and up to two tons of bombs. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=125.96s)]
*  In World War II, the U.S. Navy unleashed a new weapon [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=130.0s)]
*  for anti-submarine warfare, the K-ship. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=132.92s)]
*  The blimp patrol, death to submarines. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=136.2s)]
*  They looked like a blimp, and they had a large control car underneath. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=139.12s)]
*  And what these K-ships did was they helped alert the convoys [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=143.04s)]
*  to any enemy submarine that may be operating in the area. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=147.04s)]
*  And although they did have some weapons on them, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=150.64s)]
*  they mainly were used to help call in reinforcements. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=153.64s)]
*  They would call in other ships. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=157.32s)]
*  Ship sinkings have reached an all-time low, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=158.84s)]
*  and the Navy salutes its blimps. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=161.6s)]
*  Up to this point, most U.S. spy balloons were not high altitude. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=163.88s)]
*  Generally, when people say high altitude, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=167.48s)]
*  you're talking about the stratosphere. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=169.36s)]
*  Most of the balloons we're talking about, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=170.96s)]
*  especially during the Civil War and World War I, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=172.6s)]
*  they flew no higher than 2,000 feet. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=175.56s)]
*  It wasn't until after World War II [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=178.44s)]
*  that the U.S. began exploring high-altitude spy balloons. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=180.32s)]
*  During the Cold War, the U.S. military launched a series of large-scale missions, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=183.64s)]
*  in which balloons carrying cameras floated over Soviet territory. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=188.0s)]
*  And when the U.S. sent troops to Iraq and Afghanistan in this century, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=191.88s)]
*  it brought balloons loaded with video cameras, sensors, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=195.64s)]
*  and thermal imaging capabilities to watch over remote bases. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  They could send these up and have surveillance 24-7 with these. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=201.72s)]
*  They could be used to monitor critical road intersections [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=206.72s)]
*  and also monitor areas to ensure that nobody was, say, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=210.72s)]
*  planting IEDs or setting up for an attack. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=214.72s)]
*  Today, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol uses surveillance balloons [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  to monitor the southern border. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  But with more advanced technology like planes and satellites, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=223.28s)]
*  why still use balloons? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=226.52s)]
*  The long loiter time that balloons offer [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  have been kind of one of their top benefits throughout the ages. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  Satellites, because they are in orbit, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=234.4s)]
*  you have shorter windows of time [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=236.84s)]
*  that you can use their sensors on them over a specific area. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  Once it passes over, you have to wait for it to kind of come back around. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=243.16s)]
*  Balloons are also less reliant on fuel than aircraft. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=246.6s)]
*  These advantages help explain why the Pentagon has shifted to increase funding [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  for high-altitude inflatables, according to a national security expert. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=253.88s)]
*  The latest high-tech balloons have the potential [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=257.76s)]
*  to track hypersonic weapons, which are being developed by China and Russia. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRF6O1vi8HY&t=259.96s)]
