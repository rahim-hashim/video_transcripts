Video Description: The Brics economic alliance – formed by China, India, Russia, Brazil and South Africa – is considering an expansion, with more than 20 countries including Saudi Arabia and Iran having formally applied to join the bloc. Brics countries already make up more than 40% of the world’s population and almost a third of the world’s GDP.

WSJ’s Alexandra Wexler analyzes the membership frenzy and whether an enlargement can ultimately threaten the powerful G-7.

# Brics: The G-7 Economic Alliance’s Rival, Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U)
*  Here's the G7, a group of seven of the world's advanced economies including the US, UK and Japan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=0.0s)]
*  And here's what some call the alternative from the developing world, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=7.68s)]
*  the BRICS, formed by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=11.52s)]
*  The BRICS is trying to position itself as the voice for emerging economies [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=17.76s)]
*  and challenge Western dominance of global affairs. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=22.32s)]
*  Its leaders are holding a summit in Johannesburg to discuss an historic expansion. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=25.759999999999998s)]
*  More than 40 countries, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, want to join. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=31.04s)]
*  The expansion of BRICS could definitely boost the group's global influence. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  Let's look at what a potential enlargement means for the alliance [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=40.0s)]
*  and its ambitions to shake up the global political and economic order. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  The original term BRIC was actually coined by a Goldman Sachs banker [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=48.72s)]
*  grouping these really different countries together because they were so fast growing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=52.8s)]
*  The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India and China formalized their relationship in 2009 [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=58.48s)]
*  and invited South Africa to join the alliance a year later. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  They decided to take that idea in an effort to create a bit of a political and economic [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=67.84s)]
*  counterpoint to what's perceived as the Western hegemony of the global political and economic spheres. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=74.16s)]
*  The BRICS countries together make up more than 40% of the world's population [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=81.12s)]
*  and almost a third of the world's GDP. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=85.68s)]
*  According to data from the International Monetary Fund, the bloc has already overtaken the G7 [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=89.28s)]
*  nation's share of the global economy on the basis of purchasing power parity. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=95.04s)]
*  That's where the purchasing power of different currencies is equalized. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=99.68s)]
*  Projections by Goldman Sachs show the world's economic balance [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=103.68s)]
*  shifting towards the BRICS and emerging economies. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=107.36000000000001s)]
*  China is expected to overtake the US as the world's largest economy by 2050 [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=110.64s)]
*  with India climbing to number three. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=116.16s)]
*  China and India have experienced massive growth since the BRICS were founded in 2009 [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=118.56s)]
*  and certainly have helped them swell in importance and remain relevant on the global stage. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=124.72s)]
*  China and Russia are pushing to enlarge BRICS. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=131.84s)]
*  Experts say Beijing is keen to create an alternative grouping to counter the US [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=135.04s)]
*  and the West on the world stage. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=139.44s)]
*  China has been bullish on expanding BRICS for some time [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=141.76s)]
*  and they're particularly keen at the moment because of the trade tensions with the US. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=145.28s)]
*  The US looking to diversify its supply chains away from China. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=150.4s)]
*  Russia sees an expansion as a way to gain more international allies [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=155.04s)]
*  following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=158.8s)]
*  South Africa publicly supports the expansion, as does Brazil, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=162.88s)]
*  but experts say behind the scenes Brazil and India want a more measured approach. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=166.96s)]
*  It seems that they are concerned about the group leaning too autocratic [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=172.4s)]
*  so they want to have very specific requirements for admission [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  to make sure that there's a balance amongst the members [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  and that it doesn't become sort of the autocratic G7. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=185.84s)]
*  More than 20 countries have formally applied to become parts of BRICS [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=190.96s)]
*  ranging from Saudi Arabia to Ethiopia, Argentina and Indonesia. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=194.64s)]
*  Experts say Saudi Arabia is a strong candidate [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=200.0s)]
*  as a major economic and energy power in the Middle East [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=202.72s)]
*  with a growing role in regional diplomacy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=206.0s)]
*  Indonesia, with the world's fourth largest population, is another strong contender. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=209.04s)]
*  Indonesia being such a large economy and important in the electrification, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=213.44s)]
*  clean energy tech, electric vehicles, might be a logical choice. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=218.88s)]
*  One reason for joining the BRICS is gaining access to the bloc's new development bank. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=223.12s)]
*  Since its founding in 2014, the bank has approved more than 30 billion dollars [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=228.4s)]
*  in loans for development and infrastructure projects. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=233.52s)]
*  Access to funding from this bank, which seem to be having more favorable terms [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=237.12s)]
*  than a traditional development bank like the World Bank or the IMF, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  is definitely something that's attractive to a lot of countries. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=246.24s)]
*  The new development bank also wants to deepen the use of local currencies [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=248.72s)]
*  instead of the US dollar for trade and financing between the BRICS nations. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=253.12s)]
*  Ultimately, experts say one of the biggest challenges for the BRICS to counter the West [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=258.96s)]
*  is to form a united voice on major global issues. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=263.92s)]
*  Generally, the countries have pretty diverse and diverging interests in politics, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=267.52s)]
*  in on security issues and even relations with the US. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=273.2s)]
*  I think the group would like to be seen as an alternative political forum [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=276.56s)]
*  to the G7 group of developed nations. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  Whether or not it is able to achieve that, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=284.24s)]
*  I think will largely depend on what countries it admits. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvcg0ry70U&t=286.64s)]
