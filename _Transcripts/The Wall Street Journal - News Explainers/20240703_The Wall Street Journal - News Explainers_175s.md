# WSJ Poll Reveals How Much Debate Hurt President Biden | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY)
*  After a disastrous performance in the first debate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=0.0s)]
*  More border patrol and more asylum officers. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=3.04s)]
*  President Trump? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=6.72s)]
*  I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=7.72s)]
*  I don't think he knows what he said either. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=10.36s)]
*  President Biden has fallen behind former President Donald Trump by six points. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=11.96s)]
*  That's the widest lead in Wall Street Journal polling since 2021. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=16.64s)]
*  Both parties were looking to this debate as a way to jolt voters, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=20.76s)]
*  and Joe Biden came out on the wrong side of that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=24.44s)]
*  As the White House and Biden campaign scrambled to contain the fallout, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=27.48s)]
*  here are the major takeaways from the Wall Street Journal's post-debate poll. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=31.2s)]
*  It was a performance that was very uneven, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  and importantly, it was pretty uneven right from the start. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=38.72s)]
*  He had difficulty finishing his sentence occasionally. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=41.6s)]
*  Look, if we finally beat Medicare. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  Post-debate, confidence in Biden's ability to lead fell. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=51.16s)]
*  80% of voters say the 81-year-old is too old to run for re-election, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=55.4s)]
*  compared to 73% of voters in February. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=60.24s)]
*  Many Democratic voters in polls and strategists have said for a while [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=63.24s)]
*  that Joe Biden's biggest vulnerability in this election [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=68.12s)]
*  was how his age was perceived by the public. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=70.44s)]
*  So the fact that our poll found that more voters think he's too old to be president [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=73.12s)]
*  after the debate than before the debate shows that he was really weakened by it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=77.48s)]
*  And Democrats are especially worried. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=81.4s)]
*  While voters have said they don't like either candidate, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=83.56s)]
*  about two-thirds of Democrats want to replace Biden on the ballot, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=86.04s)]
*  more than the number of Republicans who want to replace Trump. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=89.76s)]
*  What our poll found is that you could draw a straight line [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=93.04s)]
*  from that debate performance by Joe Biden to how the public is viewing him today, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=95.64s)]
*  because only 6% of people in our poll who said that they watched the debate or heard about it [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  thought that Joe Biden exceeded their expectations. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=105.72s)]
*  That number was 46% for Trump. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  Even though Trump expanded his lead, voters still have concerns about him too. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=112.12s)]
*  We're going to make this country successful again, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=116.52s)]
*  because right now it's a failing nation. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=118.48s)]
*  My retribution is going to be success. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=120.4s)]
*  While a lot of the attention will be on Biden, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=122.36s)]
*  when we asked voters which was a bigger concern, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=124.56s)]
*  Trump's behavior or Biden's age, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=127.6s)]
*  voters were about equally split on which was a bigger concern. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=129.92s)]
*  Biden and White House aides have been insistent that he will not drop out of the race, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=134.0s)]
*  but they have a lot of Democrats to win over after the debate. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  The Biden campaign and Joe Biden himself have acknowledged that it was a bad night for them. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=142.11999999999998s)]
*  But their theory of the case of why they should stay in the race [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=146.72s)]
*  and their theory of the case of how Joe Biden can rebound, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=149.28s)]
*  is that the closer we get to election day, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  the more stark the choice will be between the policies of Donald Trump and Joe Biden, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=154.04s)]
*  not simply their personalities or how they present. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=158.83999999999997s)]
*  And so that's their theory of the case. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=162.44s)]
*  A lot of Democrats have been saying the last couple of days that they disagree with that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  and they would like to pick a different candidate [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=168.16s)]
*  and we're just going to have to see how it plays out. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9xhdIfMjY&t=169.64s)]
