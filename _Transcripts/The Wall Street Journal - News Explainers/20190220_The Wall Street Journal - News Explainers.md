# What Are Stock Buybacks and Why Are There Calls to Restrict Them?
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 20, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8)
*  Bernie Sanders and Chuck Schumer have introduced a plan to restrict corporate stock buybacks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=0.0s)]
*  This would be an unprecedented step in the government basically telling business what they could do with their money. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=5.0s)]
*  But is this just political rhetoric or is there something to this? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=11.0s)]
*  So the whole plan centers around stock buybacks. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=15.0s)]
*  And that's essentially when companies take the money they have saved up and use it to buy back shares in the stock market. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=18.0s)]
*  The result is earnings per share, the profit a company makes for every share, goes up. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=24.0s)]
*  And that often drives up the stock price. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=29.0s)]
*  The Democrats want companies to be required to do something for their employees, give them raises, improve their pensions, things like that, before they give money back to shareholders. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=31.0s)]
*  But hold on a moment. How did we get here? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=41.0s)]
*  The political issue, which you're going to hear about a ton over the next two years, is wages for the middle class have just stagnated for the last 20 years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=43.0s)]
*  The average American family makes around $60,000 a year. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=52.0s)]
*  And that's roughly the same as it was 20 years ago. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=55.0s)]
*  Politicians realize there's a lot of anger about that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=58.0s)]
*  It's one of the reasons Donald Trump was elected and the Democrats are going to try to use it to get back into power. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=60.0s)]
*  When Donald Trump took office, soon after they had this big tax cut. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=65.0s)]
*  And the major impact of that was corporate profits went up. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=69.0s)]
*  But also the economy did really well and that drove down the unemployment rate, which helped workers. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=72.0s)]
*  One criticism of the Trump tax plan is that the companies used a lot of that money and just bought back stock. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=78.0s)]
*  And so they did not give workers raises necessarily. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=85.0s)]
*  And what they did do was buy back shares, drive up the stock price. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=88.0s)]
*  And as everyone knows, the people who own stock, the biggest owners of stock, are rich people. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=92.0s)]
*  And so this was seen as a give back to the rich while the workers didn't get much. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=98.0s)]
*  The counter argument is the money that goes to the buybacks goes to investors and they reinvest it and that boosts the economy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=104.0s)]
*  Another underlying issue is over the past couple of decades, a big trend has emerged in corporate America. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=111.0s)]
*  So companies make revenue and that revenue is split between profits and wages for employees. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=117.0s)]
*  And the portion going to profits has gone up a lot. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=124.0s)]
*  The share taken by employees has gone down. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=127.0s)]
*  So the idea behind the Democrats' plan is companies are going to have to give employees something, a raise, better benefits, et cetera, before they can benefit their shareholders. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=130.0s)]
*  And that goes against tradition and all the precedents before, which is companies basically can control the cash they have. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=140.0s)]
*  One of the problems with a plan like this is if I'm a company and I'm sitting on $10 billion in cash, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=148.0s)]
*  well, if there are restrictions on what I'm going to do in terms of a buyback, I'm just not going to buy back the stock. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=153.0s)]
*  I'm just going to leave the money sitting in my bank account. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=159.0s)]
*  And that doesn't benefit anybody. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=162.0s)]
*  The other problem is companies are not going to give workers raises unless they have to, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=164.0s)]
*  unless the wages for all other industries around them are going up. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=169.0s)]
*  I think the Democrats are trying to take a stand. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=173.0s)]
*  They're trying to make this an issue in the campaign. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=175.0s)]
*  There are more conventional ways to accomplish similar goals. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=178.0s)]
*  So you can do tax cuts for working class people. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=182.0s)]
*  You can raise the minimum wage. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=184.0s)]
*  Republican Senator Marco Rubio has a plan out now where they would tax essentially the corporate buybacks. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=186.0s)]
*  It would work like a dividend payment where the shareholders would get a bill when the company bought back stock. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=193.0s)]
*  So you can do tax cuts for working class people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=198.0s)]
*  You can raise the minimum wage. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=201.0s)]
*  Other Republicans will talk about, well, we need to reduce regulation, increase investment, and get the economy growing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=203.0s)]
*  And that's what makes workers earn more money. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=209.0s)]
*  The Democrats just control the House of Representatives. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=211.0s)]
*  So this bill isn't going anywhere. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=213.0s)]
*  But the rhetoric and the discussion around middle class wages and working class wages is going to be with us for a long time. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7RsiD7tM8&t=216.0s)]
