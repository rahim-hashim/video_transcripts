# GameStop Saga Spurs Debate Over Payment for Order Flow Practice | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 19, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4)
*  In February, Congress grilled executives from Robinhood and Citadel Securities over their [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=0.0s)]
*  role in the GameStop trading frenzy. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=5.64s)]
*  And throughout the hearing, a phrase came up over and over again. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=8.44s)]
*  Payment for order flow. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=12.0s)]
*  Payment for order flow. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=13.0s)]
*  Payment for order flow. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=14.32s)]
*  Payment for order flow. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=15.32s)]
*  With respect to payment for order flow, we simply play by the rules of the road. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=16.8s)]
*  Payment for order flow is a decades-old practice that's at the heart of how commission-free [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=21.5s)]
*  brokers operate. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=25.68s)]
*  And it's creating controversy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  Critics claim that the practice creates a conflict of interest that is bad for investors. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=29.52s)]
*  While it may enable free commissions and explicit costs, there are implied costs we feel everyone [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=34.64s)]
*  ignores. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=40.6s)]
*  But supporters say the practice is misunderstood and that it's actually good for investors. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=41.6s)]
*  Whether you're a Robinhood client or a Fidelity client, you're getting a price that is at [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=47.0s)]
*  or better than the national best bid or best offer. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  Right, that's the thing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=53.64s)]
*  There's nothing nefarious going on here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=55.0s)]
*  In the GameStop episode, the SEC is expected to conduct a review that could change the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=57.12s)]
*  rules of payment for order flow and how brokers operate. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=61.76s)]
*  When an investor buys a stock on a commission-free trading app, the transaction is executed almost [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=68.72s)]
*  instantly. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=74.12s)]
*  But a lot is going on behind the scenes. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=75.12s)]
*  Let's take a look at the main players. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=77.44s)]
*  There are buyers, the investors who want to purchase a stock, and there are sellers, the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=79.72s)]
*  investors who want to unload a stock. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  There's also the broker, the firm that accepts investors' orders and makes sure they get [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=86.48s)]
*  executed. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  And finally, there are the market makers, which buy the orders from the broker and execute [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  them. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=97.0s)]
*  These are usually high-frequency traders like Virtue Financial and Citadel Securities. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=98.0s)]
*  And they are the players that make the trade actually happen. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=103.2s)]
*  When you're the investor and you're buying, the market maker is selling. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=106.4s)]
*  If you're the investor and you're selling, the market maker is buying. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=109.4s)]
*  But the market maker hopes to do a lot of little trades all day long and eventually [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=113.2s)]
*  arrive at a place where they're flat. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=117.48s)]
*  Zero-commission brokers make money by selling customers' orders to market makers. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=119.8s)]
*  This is payment for order flow. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=124.42s)]
*  The practice enables trades to be executed at a high volume very quickly. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=126.4s)]
*  It also means that most orders entered by small investors never get sent to public exchanges, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  like the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=136.22s)]
*  Instead, small investors' orders get executed privately by market makers. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=138.32s)]
*  Let's break down how the process works. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=142.44s)]
*  Say an investor wants to sell 200 shares of a stock. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=145.32s)]
*  So they place an order with a broker. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=148.68s)]
*  The chances that another person wants to buy that exact amount of shares at the same time [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=151.12s)]
*  is pretty low. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=155.76s)]
*  But that's okay, because the broker routes the orders to a market maker. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=156.9s)]
*  The market maker fills it within a fraction of a second. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=161.34s)]
*  But that comes with risk. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=164.76s)]
*  The risk that the price of the stock could fall before the market maker can sell the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=166.16s)]
*  200 shares to someone else. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=170.04s)]
*  The market maker is paid for taking on this risk through what is known as the bid-ask [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=172.32s)]
*  spread. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=176.6s)]
*  You can see it here. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=177.6s)]
*  The spread is the difference in price between what buyers are paying for a stock and what [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  sellers are selling for. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  It doesn't usually amount to much. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=184.88s)]
*  On stock exchanges, it's often just a penny per share. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=187.0s)]
*  When market makers execute trades privately, the spread can be even tighter. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=190.38s)]
*  This is because the prices can be in fractions of a penny. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  Today, using our example, that the spread is just half a cent. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=198.96s)]
*  So buying and selling those 200 shares would make the market maker $1. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=203.0s)]
*  But as millions of shares are traded, the profits from the spread add up. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=207.5s)]
*  It's easy money for them. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=211.78s)]
*  The retail investors are small, they don't place very large orders, and they don't tend [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=213.12s)]
*  to be extremely well informed about the movements of the stock price. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=216.16s)]
*  In 2020, these brokerages collected almost $2.6 billion in payments for stock and option [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  orders. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=225.96s)]
*  This is part of what's driving the current controversy over the practice. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=226.96s)]
*  Some critics say that payment for order flow creates a conflict of interest between the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  broker's duty to seek the best execution for trades and its desire to maximize its [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=235.72s)]
*  own profits. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=240.24s)]
*  In the U.S., brokers have what is called a duty of best execution. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=241.24s)]
*  They have to get you the best possible execution on your trades or at least attempt to do so. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=245.4s)]
*  If a broker is taking a lot of money in payment for order flow, then odds are it's not really [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=250.94s)]
*  giving you a best execution. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=255.22s)]
*  Critics say this is because brokerages could be tempted to send customer orders to the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=257.22s)]
*  market centers that pay them the biggest rebate, or that brokers could be demanding greater [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=260.98s)]
*  payments from the market makers. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=266.1s)]
*  This is why the practice is banned in some other countries like the UK. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=267.98s)]
*  In other countries where payment for order flow is illegal, everything has to go to exchanges [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=272.56s)]
*  so everything is in the lit markets where everybody can see the prices coming together, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=278.02s)]
*  and all the trading happens kind of out in the open. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=283.64s)]
*  Some critics even worry that market makers could be front-running investor stock trades, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=286.76s)]
*  but supporters say these claims aren't true. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=291.26s)]
*  Brokers and market makers argue that payment for order flow often gives investors a better [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=293.74s)]
*  price than the best market price, and that it helps make trading easier. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=297.88s)]
*  So payment for order flow has a very big benefit for investors, and that is it has allowed [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=302.68s)]
*  the emergence of zero commission trading. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=307.84s)]
*  It was just a few years ago that brokers were typically charging $4.95, $7.95 or more [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=310.2s)]
*  for a single stock trade. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=315.47999999999996s)]
*  A couple years ago that went away. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=317.08s)]
*  Robinhood set the practice, and then a bunch of others like Schwab, TD Ameritrade, E-Trade [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  followed. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=325.32s)]
*  A Robinhood spokesperson said that Robinhood sends customer orders to market makers that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=326.32s)]
*  typically offer better prices than public exchanges, and that it's proud of what it's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=330.4s)]
*  done to change the industry for all retail investors. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=334.4s)]
*  In the past, the SEC has approved of payment for order flow as long as brokers make certain [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=337.96s)]
*  disclosures, like where they're routing investors' orders and how much they're getting paid [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=343.08s)]
*  for them. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  The agency has said that small investors generally get better prices when their orders are sent [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=348.44s)]
*  to market makers, rather than exchanges. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=352.88s)]
*  But the volatility in GameStop is raising alarms in Congress, where lawmakers are calling [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=355.47999999999996s)]
*  for fresh scrutiny of payment for order flow. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=359.84s)]
*  In February, SEC Acting Chairwoman Alison Herron Lee wrote a letter showing support [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  for a wholesale review of the practice. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=367.26000000000005s)]
*  If the review uncovers any sort of abuses, what I think is most likely going to happen [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=370.18s)]
*  is that the SEC will require some sort of new disclosures coming out of brokers and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=374.5s)]
*  maybe out of market makers. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  If payment for order flow were banned, market makers would still be able to make money. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=381.22s)]
*  After all, they're still doing the same thing, collecting the bid ask spread. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=385.38s)]
*  However, the thing that would likely change is that zero commission trading would be endangered. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=389.62s)]
*  As the GameStop saga continues to unfold, the future of payment for order flow and zero [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=394.64s)]
*  commission trading remains uncertain. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRgwHM-XPh4&t=399.52s)]
