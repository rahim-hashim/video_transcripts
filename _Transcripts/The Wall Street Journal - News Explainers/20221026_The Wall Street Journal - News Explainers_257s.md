# Is the Economy as Bad as Political Ads Make It Sound?  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M)
*  By some measures, our economy is doing great. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=0.0s)]
*  Food, fuel, everything costs too much. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=3.12s)]
*  Both of these candidates are kind of right. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=6.72s)]
*  Leading into the midterm elections, inflation is high, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=9.28s)]
*  the highest in the last 40 years, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=12.64s)]
*  and gas prices are volatile. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=14.84s)]
*  Though they've come down recently, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=16.9s)]
*  there's still a lot of uncertainty [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=18.32s)]
*  about where they're going next. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=19.92s)]
*  But then again, there's incredibly low unemployment. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=21.88s)]
*  Just look at the number of job openings right now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=24.84s)]
*  Things are expensive, but people are working. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=27.44s)]
*  Yet most economists pulled by The Wall Street Journal [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=30.28s)]
*  believe the U.S. is headed towards a recession [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=32.64s)]
*  in the next year. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=34.94s)]
*  The economy is always a big deal in any election. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=36.24s)]
*  I mean, as James Carville once famously coined the term [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=38.74s)]
*  in 1992, it's the economy, stupid. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  This year is obviously a year [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=43.44s)]
*  where we're seeing a lot of interest, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=45.56s)]
*  a lot of intensity and debate about the economy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=47.44s)]
*  Here's how the economy actually is doing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=50.88s)]
*  and why it matters for the November midterms. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=53.2s)]
*  I can't tell you how many times I've seen gas pumps [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=56.24s)]
*  and grocery store aisles in political ads this year. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  Inflation is one of the big economic measures [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=61.88s)]
*  you can feel personally. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=64.16s)]
*  And I feel the pain too, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=65.76s)]
*  because I do the grocery shopping. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=66.92s)]
*  And not just at the grocery store, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=69.16s)]
*  although the price of food has gone up [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=70.84s)]
*  more than most things. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=72.88s)]
*  If you look at median weekly earnings, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=74.68s)]
*  people are making less than they were [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=76.68s)]
*  during the last election, if adjusted for inflation. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=78.72s)]
*  Inflation is sort of taking a bite out of, you know, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=82.0s)]
*  what otherwise would be a fairly strong [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=85.24s)]
*  and robust economy coming out of the pandemic. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=88.36s)]
*  Republicans are largely blaming. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=91.16s)]
*  Biden's reckless spending. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=93.24s)]
*  Trillions in spending. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=94.64s)]
*  Out of control spending. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=95.88s)]
*  While Democrats point out. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=97.44s)]
*  The supply chain. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  More microchip here in America. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=99.8s)]
*  To get the supply chain moving again. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=101.84s)]
*  We'll beat inflation one chip at a time. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=103.6s)]
*  There's a lot of reasons for why inflation [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=105.88s)]
*  is at this super high level. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=108.16s)]
*  You know, it has to do with global supply chains. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=110.32s)]
*  It has to do with the pandemic. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=113.2s)]
*  It has to do with energy prices. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  You know, the situation in Ukraine. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=118.16s)]
*  All of that has contributed to astronomical price increases. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  And so both parties are trying to point [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=125.56s)]
*  to certain aspects of that bigger formula. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  Another place voters have felt the economic pressure. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  If you're fed up every time you fill up. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=134.72s)]
*  Let's take a closer look at that gas price chart. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=137.56s)]
*  Here is where the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=140.2s)]
*  Experts largely blamed that war for the initial increase, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  but it stayed high for a number of reasons. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=146.44s)]
*  Republicans blame. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=149.04s)]
*  Our energy production has been crippled. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=150.11999999999998s)]
*  They've cratered our domestic energy production. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=152.16s)]
*  While Democrats blame. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  Oil companies gouging us at the pump. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=155.76s)]
*  Price gouging by big oil. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=157.56s)]
*  Both sides have some points, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  but there's no sort of easy answer. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=161.64s)]
*  Analysts point at things beyond the Biden administration's [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  control, like maintenance at refineries. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=166.64s)]
*  Some of these things just have to do with global supply chains [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=169.32s)]
*  coming out of the pandemic. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=172.64s)]
*  We're just obviously in a really weird time for the economy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=173.88s)]
*  Americans' frustration over rising prices [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  show up in arguably the most important factor [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=180.76s)]
*  going into the election. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=183.23999999999998s)]
*  How people feel. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=184.56s)]
*  This is the consumer sentiment index. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  It measures how optimistic or pessimistic people [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=189.04s)]
*  are feeling about the economy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=191.92s)]
*  In the last 40 years, every time the president's party [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=194.0s)]
*  has lost a large number of seats in the midterms, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=196.76s)]
*  it was after a period where Americans felt pessimistic [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=199.6s)]
*  about the economy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=202.72s)]
*  You never want voters to be in a grumpy mood [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=203.92s)]
*  when you're the party in power. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=208.04s)]
*  It's easier for them to sort of cast that ballot in opposition. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=210.8s)]
*  And right now, people feel worse about the economy [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=214.8s)]
*  than they even did during the Great Recession, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=217.64s)]
*  even though there are far fewer people [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=220.6s)]
*  filing unemployment claims today [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=222.48s)]
*  than there were during that recession. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  There are also more jobs being added today [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=226.76s)]
*  than even during the Great Recession's recovery. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=229.04s)]
*  By these measures, the economy is good. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  But where people feel the economy the most, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=235.56s)]
*  the grocery store and the gas station, it's not. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  For voters, they're definitely hearing, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=240.88s)]
*  you know, the blame game from both sides. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=242.64s)]
*  And ultimately, for them, it's going to come down, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=244.48s)]
*  which party do you think has the best chance of fixing it? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlhdZXHOy_M&t=247.16s)]
