# How North Korea Uses Ships to Trick and Trade
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 27, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA)
*  Over the last two years, the United Nations and the U.S. have tightened economic sanctions on North Korea like never before. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=0.0s)]
*  But in fact, ships are still bringing oil into the country and transporting North Korean coal and other goods overseas, according to UN and U.S. officials. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=8.0s)]
*  Pyongyang has found creative ways to evade international sanctions, including disguises, covering tracks, and seeking ground support. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=17.0s)]
*  Here's how North Korea manages to keep trading at sea based on a months-long WSJ investigation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=24.0s)]
*  Like many terrestrial criminals, ships use disguises to cover their real identity, including fake flags. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=30.0s)]
*  North Korea-linked operators have been caught erasing the ship's names from the hulls and paint false names and ID numbers to trick those who are watching. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=37.0s)]
*  Some oil tankers get a more elaborate makeover with fake cargo hatches built on them so that patrol aircraft mistake them for cargo ships. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=45.0s)]
*  At sea, crews use your transponders, which relay the ship's position to others to broadcast a false identity. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=53.0s)]
*  They pretend, for instance, that their ship is registered in Fiji when it is actually North Korean, or that it is a fishing vessel rather than a freighter. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=60.0s)]
*  False signals can even give the impression the ship is longer and shorter than its actual size to confuse authorities and investigators. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=68.0s)]
*  To hide exactly where they are going, ships choreograph voyages that make them hard to track. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=75.0s)]
*  North Korean tankers rendezvous with other ships in the middle of the ocean, U.S. officials say. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=81.0s)]
*  That way, they can transfer petroleum products from those ships without having to enter a foreign port themselves. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=86.0s)]
*  Two dozen North Korean tankers have made at least 148 such deliveries to North Korean ports this year, according to authorities monitoring their activities. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=92.0s)]
*  To export coal, a ship may first loiter near a port, say in China, without actually making a visit. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=101.0s)]
*  It manipulates its draft, which shows how much of the ship is underwater, to make it look like it has loaded coal. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=108.0s)]
*  Next, it turns off its tracker to fetch coal from North Korea, then switches the tracker back on as it sails to other countries, like Vietnam, to deliver it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=114.0s)]
*  To port authorities there, it looks like the coal was from China, and fake paperwork supports that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=123.0s)]
*  This is how a ship called the Hua Fu operated, according to U.N. experts. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=128.0s)]
*  Evading sanctions at sea requires support from ship owners and managers on land. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=133.0s)]
*  The owners of these vessels are often front companies in places like Hong Kong, which makes it difficult to find out who really controls them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=138.0s)]
*  The ships are often registered in countries that offer flags of convenience, which means they allow foreign-owned ships to sail under their flags for a fee. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=146.0s)]
*  Countries ranging from Panama to Togo and Palau offer this service. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=154.0s)]
*  They have come under pressure from the U.N. and others to investigate their ship registries and deflag ships that may be linked to North Korea. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=159.0s)]
*  In some cases, ship operators don't bother with registration at all. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=166.0s)]
*  They just fake the paperwork to make it look like they have, the Wall Street Journal found. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=170.0s)]
*  North Korea didn't respond to a request for comment. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=174.0s)]
*  Authorities say Pyongyang has been using increasingly sophisticated techniques. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=177.0s)]
*  North Korea-linked ships often use tactics in bundles and layers rather than one at a time, making them particularly hard to catch. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=182.0s)]
*  Patrol aircraft face vast open seas with thousands of ships conducting legal trade. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=189.0s)]
*  An enforcement of sanctions depends on officials and agents around the world, some of whom may be willing to help for a bribe. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=194.0s)]
*  Although advanced ship tracking and satellite technology has helped, sanctions are tough to enforce without a high level of global cooperation. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=201.0s)]
*  That's why, some experts argue, North Korea will likely get away with quite a bit for quite a while. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yoZdJ14QjA&t=208.0s)]
