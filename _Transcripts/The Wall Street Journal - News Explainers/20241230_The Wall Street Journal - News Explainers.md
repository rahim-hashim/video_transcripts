# How Jimmy Carter Jump-Started the Craft Beer Revolution  WSJ

*  These craft beers are staple in American supermarkets and liquor stores. But did [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=0.0s)]

*  in relation to peanuts but you know it would be very fair to think about beer [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=13.84s)]
*  when you think about Carter as well. When President Carter signed his law I do [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=17.72s)]
*  remember there was a lot of jubilation. The industry was just starting to come [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=21.18s)]
*  together to support homebrew shops and homebrewing. The bill that Carter signed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=25.96s)]
*  into law in 1978 legalized homebrewing and jump-started the American craft [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=30.68s)]
*  brew industry. Today the big brewers still dominate the beer market but craft [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=35.84s)]
*  beer makes up 13.1% of the total market. Since 1990 the vast majority of new [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  breweries have been craft breweries whereas the number of non craft brewers [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=48.0s)]
*  has seen little growth. But long before Carter launched the craft beer boom that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=51.92s)]
*  we know today the legacy of prohibition loomed large over American beer. When [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  prohibition was repealed in 1933 the federal government looked back to how [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  it had regulated home alcohol production prior to prohibition because there had [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=67.4s)]
*  been no previous specific mention of beer they made no specific mention of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  beer when they were repealing prohibition so homebrewing essentially [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=75.64s)]
*  remained illegal. Open a Budweiser and pour yourself the most inviting glass of beer. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=79.4s)]
*  The beer industry that emerged post prohibition was dominated by the biggest [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=84.2s)]
*  brewers pre prohibition. The breweries that had really been able to survive [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=88.4s)]
*  were the very big breweries. Breweries like Anheuser-Busch, Schlitz, Pabst and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  Coors but the breweries that had really fallen away were the smaller breweries [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=96.92s)]
*  the ones that served very local customers the ones who had been guardians [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  of ethnic and regional diversity. The year before prohibition started in 1919 [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=105.2s)]
*  there were 669 brewers. Then the year following its repeal in 1933 that number [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=110.16s)]
*  fell to 331 and fast forward to the end of the 1970s and years of consolidation [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=116.2s)]
*  reduced the number of American brewers even further. The five largest breweries [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  in the country produced nearly 75% of the volume of American beer. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  It's no city beer. It's cool. Fewer brewers translated into a mostly homogenous beer market. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=130.48s)]
*  In the 1970s a typical American beer or an adjunct light lager was a mild easy [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  drinking low alcohol beverage. Popular brands include Budweiser, Miller and Coors. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=143.2s)]
*  The roots of American craft beer started to emerge in the 1960s and 70s when [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  homebrewers began homebrewing underground. Homebrewers were interested [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=154.6s)]
*  in what was then less well-known European varieties like IPAs, pale ales, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=158.84s)]
*  porters, stouts and others. One of these homebrewers was Ken Grossman the founder [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=163.64s)]
*  of Sierra Nevada Brewing Company. I started homebrewing when I was about 15 [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=171.56s)]
*  years old. Well I hid it away in my closet for some time so it wasn't widely [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=176.04s)]
*  known and then when I was exposed I was saying I was doing as an experiment I [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  wasn't drinking it. It was technically illegal to make beer at home. It wasn't [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=185.44s)]
*  illegal to sell malt and hops and yeast. Everything changed in 1978 when then [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=189.12s)]
*  President Jimmy Carter signed HR 1337, a law that lifted 50 years of prohibition [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=195.2s)]
*  regulations on homebrewing that had made the craft illegal. Carter signing the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=201.16s)]
*  resolution at this point in time when resources were really becoming [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=206.6s)]
*  available to small brewers who were eager and excited to make beer in a new [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=211.08s)]
*  way. I think the timing is really important. The roots of craft brewing is [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=216.08s)]
*  homebrewing and I think it was right about the same time that I was planning [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=220.56s)]
*  on opening a brewery that the law got passed so it certainly showed that the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=224.60000000000002s)]
*  future was probably going to be more interesting for homebrewing due to the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=229.16000000000003s)]
*  wider availability of ingredients and knowledge. The new law created an [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=232.8s)]
*  exemption from taxation of beer brewed at home for personal or family use. HR [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=238.4s)]
*  1337 permitted adults to brew up to a hundred gallons per person or 200 gallons [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=243.56s)]
*  per household annually. Currently the American Homebrewers Association [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=249.28s)]
*  estimates that more than 90% of craft brewers began as homebrewers and so it's [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=252.84s)]
*  intuitive that an environment in which homebrewing is legal and common is going [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=258.08s)]
*  to enable the creation of small businesses of craft breweries. There's a [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=262.44s)]
*  clear tie between the two and I would say that certainly craft beer and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=266.6s)]
*  the way it looks today with nearly 10,000 breweries, it would not [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=271.88s)]
*  be possible without homebrewing, without homebrewers. At the time [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=276.88s)]
*  President Carter seemed an unlikely ally to homebrewers. Known for mostly [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=281.88s)]
*  abstaining from alcohol while in office, Carter limited liquor in the White House [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=286.72s)]
*  during his term. I have tried Billy beer. Somewhere I have some cans of Billy beer [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  around and it was a bit of a novelty. Carter's closest connection to booze was [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=295.16s)]
*  probably his brother Bill's short-lived beer brand, Billy beer. Originally [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=299.92s)]
*  promoted by Billy Carter back in 1977, the Billy beer brand was relaunched in [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=304.32000000000005s)]
*  2019 for the modern market as a craft beer. This is Billy. Billy beer. America's [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=309.0s)]
*  light craft beer. I mean the US sort of used to be the laughing stock of beer if [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=315.6s)]
*  you were a European and you came to the US and you know drank an American light [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=320.44000000000005s)]
*  lager beer in the 50s or 60s, you didn't really think a lot of American beer as [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=324.44s)]
*  far as having character and then craft brewing really changed that whole [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=329.16s)]
*  dynamic. We know that we would not have craft brewing without homebrewing, we [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=332.04s)]
*  would not have homebrewing without its legalization. I think Carter's role was [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=336.04s)]
*  incredibly important and instrumental in this. So next time you enjoy a craft [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=340.52s)]
*  beer, you can raise a glass to Jimmy Carter. So this is the very first batch of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=345.52s)]
*  beer we brewed in the brewery. They call it 1979 Stout. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8IRonAGztE&t=351.32s)]
