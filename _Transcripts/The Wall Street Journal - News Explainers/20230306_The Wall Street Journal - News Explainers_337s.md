# Why America's Biggest Cities Are Littered With Vacant Lots | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M)
*  This vacant parcel of land in Austin, Texas, might not look like much, but it offers a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=0.0s)]
*  glimpse into how a skewed property tax system is worsening the housing crisis in America's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=5.0s)]
*  biggest cities. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  The lot has an annual property tax bill of about $1.5 million per acre. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=11.26s)]
*  But just six blocks over, this luxury apartment building is taxed at nearly double that rate. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=16.7s)]
*  Cities all over the country are littered with empty or sparsely built sites. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=22.56s)]
*  Some economists say they share a common factor, a tax system that combines low taxes on land [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=26.72s)]
*  with high taxes on buildings. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=32.2s)]
*  Here's a closer look at that system and the often overlooked role it plays in the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=34.4s)]
*  country's housing shortage. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=38.72s)]
*  To understand the tax system, let's head back to 701 Trinity Street. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=41.6s)]
*  Located near the heart of downtown Austin, the 0.2 acre parcel is valued at over $13.7 [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=46.4s)]
*  million. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  Yet for decades, the lot has only been used for parking, and the owners have paid relatively [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=53.279999999999994s)]
*  little in taxes because it doesn't contain any buildings. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=57.959999999999994s)]
*  Cielo Property Group owns the vacant plot of land. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=61.28s)]
*  They did not respond to a request for comment. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=64.12s)]
*  So traditional property taxes, perversely, disincentivize the kind of land use that we [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  want to see in our cities. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=71.38s)]
*  When you're taxing improvements, you're signaling to the market that you don't want improvements. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=73.0s)]
*  Josephine Foss is the executive director of the Robert Schockenbach Foundation, a nonprofit [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=77.88s)]
*  research organization that advocates for property tax reform. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=82.68s)]
*  So they actually affect the way that people use land or choose not to use land, which [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  is something that might not initially be obvious, thinking about property taxes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=91.04s)]
*  When landowners improve their property, by adding a new room, for instance, their taxes [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=96.16s)]
*  go up. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=100.2s)]
*  In some cases, these taxes can be as much as seven times higher for a developed piece [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=101.2s)]
*  of land compared to an empty lot. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=105.44s)]
*  The basic premise of property taxes in America is very simple. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=108.08s)]
*  It's basically the government will try to figure out how much is a piece of real estate [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=110.84s)]
*  worth and then based on that value, you'll be taxed. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=114.76s)]
*  The more valuable your real estate is, the higher your tax. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  Presumably, the owners of more expensive buildings would be able to afford more expensive rates. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  But some economists say the system has an unintended consequence. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=125.98s)]
*  It makes it easy for people to take up properties and then just hold them until the value increases, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=129.8s)]
*  sell at a profit, right? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=135.4s)]
*  So the buy low, sell high, but without doing anything in the interim, including building [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=136.56s)]
*  housing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=141.8s)]
*  Over the last few years, Texas home prices have skyrocketed. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  In January, Austin's median home price was $525,000, according to the Austin Board of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=146.6s)]
*  Realtors. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=152.28s)]
*  That's a 36% jump from January 2020. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=153.28s)]
*  So housing shortages have always existed in cities like New York and San Francisco. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=156.6s)]
*  What's really changed in the last couple of years is that you're seeing more of this issue [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  in places in the Sun Belt. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=163.76s)]
*  I think Austin's really the textbook case of the booming Sun Belt city that's now running [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=165.36s)]
*  into all these housing shortage problems. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=169.52s)]
*  Because it used to be an affordable place and now it's really one of the most expensive [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  places in the South. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  But despite rising demand for housing, developers struggle to find sites to build on. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=177.3s)]
*  Developers paradoxically are having a hard time finding land, but even those lots where [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=182.44000000000003s)]
*  law does allow you to build, often people just don't want to sell. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=186.74s)]
*  Austin alone has more than 17,500 vacant lots zoned for residential use, according [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=189.92s)]
*  to Altus Group, a real estate analytics firm. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=195.64s)]
*  In Atlanta, Georgia, there's more than 13,000. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  And New York City has more than 77,000 lots that are vacant or less than half the size [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=201.76s)]
*  of what zoning allows. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=206.76s)]
*  That's a lot of untapped potential. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=208.72s)]
*  If the owners of all the vacant lots in Austin developed buildings to match the current density [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  of the city, they could add over 1 billion square feet of housing, according to an Altus [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=215.27999999999997s)]
*  Group estimate. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=219.6s)]
*  That's equivalent to about 384 Empire State Buildings, or over 800,000 additional apartment [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=221.12s)]
*  units. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=226.84s)]
*  So it's really adding to this issue of affordable housing or housing accessibility. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=227.84s)]
*  One solution proposed by lawmakers comes in the form of a land value tax. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=232.64s)]
*  This places a higher tax rate on land while reducing taxes on buildings. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=237.04s)]
*  In theory, this system would reduce the profit that comes from owning a vacant piece of property. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=241.44s)]
*  So if your tax code is set up that you can make money by improving the land that you've [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=246.8s)]
*  just been sitting on or selling it to somebody who will, that's what's going to happen. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=250.60000000000002s)]
*  Research suggests this type of taxing system has increased building activity in cities [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=255.56s)]
*  like Pittsburgh. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=259.44s)]
*  A couple of studies have actually shown that they had more construction activity in Pittsburgh [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=260.44s)]
*  relative to other nearby and similar cities that didn't have this sort of tax system. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=265.04s)]
*  Still, fairly assessing the value of land for taxation can be difficult. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=269.36s)]
*  Some economists say it's simpler to assess improvements based on their income producing [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=273.96s)]
*  ability. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=277.96s)]
*  There are also political hurdles to implementing a new tax system. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=278.96s)]
*  One of the big challenges in America is that often under state law, cities and counties [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  can't decide on their own tax system. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  They basically have to defer to the state. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=290.88s)]
*  When it comes to building more housing, some developers say a land value tax may only make [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=292.84s)]
*  a small difference. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  Factors like restrictive zoning laws and rising material costs also play a role in [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=298.76s)]
*  delaying construction projects. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=303.24s)]
*  Despite the challenges, one city, Detroit, may soon implement a land value tax. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=305.16s)]
*  If approved, lawmakers and housing advocates say this could be a crucial test case for [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=310.52s)]
*  the tax policy. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  Detroit would be the biggest city in the history of America to implement a land value tax. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  And it'd be a fascinating test case on whether this actually works in the 21st century and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=321.44s)]
*  whether others would follow suit. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=326.36s)]
*  If it works out, it can really change the way Americans think about property taxes. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqCaklMv6M&t=327.72s)]
