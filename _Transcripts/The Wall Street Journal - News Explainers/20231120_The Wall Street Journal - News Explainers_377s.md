# NASA’s Infrastructure Crisis, Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw)
*  Spacecraft tens of billions of miles away rely on this network of satellite dishes to communicate with Earth. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=0.0s)]
*  But this system is in trouble. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=6.68s)]
*  The Deep Space Network is operating at capacity and can't keep up with increasing demand, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=9.0s)]
*  which experts say could lead to loss of important scientific data, like information about the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=14.0s)]
*  Sun's magnetic field, if nothing is done. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=18.8s)]
*  The thought of not having that constant connection to our astronauts, to these key science missions, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=21.2s)]
*  is a challenging and concerning topic. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=25.52s)]
*  Here's how NASA's infrastructure got to this critical stage and what it'll take to fix it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=28.0s)]
*  The Deep Space Network, or DSN, uses radio frequencies to send and receive data, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=34.0s)]
*  like this image of the southern ring nebula from the James Webb Telescope, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=39.0s)]
*  or the sounds of dense plasma captured by the Voyager spacecraft as it studies interstellar space. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=43.0s)]
*  The DSN also commands, tracks, and monitors the health and safety of spacecraft like Juno, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=49.0s)]
*  which is studying Jupiter. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=55.0s)]
*  What we do in space transfers directly to the Earth. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=56.0s)]
*  Think about the impact that Apollo had on what we do today. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=59.0s)]
*  Camera systems, the technology transfer into the industry, there were certain fields that didn't even exist before Apollo, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=62.0s)]
*  like software engineering. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=67.0s)]
*  Because a spacecraft's radio signals are being transmitted from billions of miles away, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=68.0s)]
*  they're incredibly faint by the time they reach Earth. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=73.0s)]
*  That's why the DSN uses these giant parabolic dish antennas and ultra-sensitive receivers. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=76.0s)]
*  There's a total of 14 antennas at three complexes around the world, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=81.0s)]
*  so spacecraft can reach the network no matter where they are. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=85.0s)]
*  Each complex has 170 meter, which is really, really large. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=88.0s)]
*  It's like most of a football field, and then a series of 34 meter antennas. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=91.0s)]
*  When data leaves a spacecraft, it travels back to an antenna where it's decoded by the local facility, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=96.0s)]
*  then sent here to the Space Flight Operations Facility in Pasadena, California, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=101.0s)]
*  where it's routed to the appropriate Mission Control Center. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=106.0s)]
*  But strain on the DSN has been growing for years. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=110.0s)]
*  According to a July Inspector General report, demand is exceeding supply by as much as 40% at times, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=113.0s)]
*  and studies show that number will reach about 50% by the 2030s. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=119.0s)]
*  Because of this, the DSN has been forced to prioritize some missions over others, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=124.0s)]
*  which has led to delays in data for some lower priority missions. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=128.0s)]
*  This happened during Artemis 1 in 2022. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=132.0s)]
*  Lift off of Artemis 1! [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=135.0s)]
*  Though it was an uncrewed mission, NASA prioritized its access to the network [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=137.0s)]
*  because it's preparing the agency to send humans to the moon for the first time in over 50 years. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=141.0s)]
*  We tracked Artemis 1 like we will track it when it has humans on board. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=146.0s)]
*  We definitely do not want to lose communication with astronauts, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=150.0s)]
*  As a result, all other missions that used the network lost over 1500 hours of data collection time during that period. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=154.0s)]
*  For example, the James Webb Telescope lost about 185 hours of data transmission time [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=161.0s)]
*  when it normally would have been able to immediately send images back to Earth. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=166.0s)]
*  Even though James Webb and the other missions were able to eventually make up for that lost time, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=170.0s)]
*  Smith says these delays could turn into losses in important data if nothing is done to increase capacity on the network. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=175.0s)]
*  Baldwin says he's especially concerned given the ambitious goals the agency has for Artemis. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=182.0s)]
*  The human landing, the gateway system, the commercial landers, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=187.0s)]
*  it's going to be challenging to meet all the objectives of all the things we want to do, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=191.0s)]
*  include science and the human exploration portion of it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=195.0s)]
*  The DSN will face an even greater strain when the network's largest capacity users [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=198.0s)]
*  will be in the same part of the sky vying for the same antennas. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=202.0s)]
*  It's very possible James Webb will take a hit on their science data collection. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=205.0s)]
*  The Europa Clipper as we build up the Artemis 3 and beyond, the Psyche mission that just launched, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=209.0s)]
*  really it's the users that require a lot of DSN time that takes the most amount of impacts. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=213.0s)]
*  So why is the DSN in this dire state? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=219.0s)]
*  One reason is that a lot of missions are lasting much longer than originally anticipated. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=221.0s)]
*  Voyager, which launched in 1977, is still transmitting data from beyond the solar system. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=227.0s)]
*  It is still going strong 46 years later. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=232.0s)]
*  Our mission load just keeps growing because we've got all the new missions [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=235.0s)]
*  and then we also have older missions that continue to operate. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=238.0s)]
*  But the big reason is that the DSN's infrastructure, some of which was built in the 60s, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=241.0s)]
*  has become increasingly difficult and costly to maintain. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=246.0s)]
*  And that cost does increase. We have inflation, supply chain issues that impact us. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=250.0s)]
*  And so there's a list of things that will impact our ability to move out on these antenna builds [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=254.0s)]
*  and also to maintain our operational readiness for supporting missions. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=258.0s)]
*  Some major upgrades also take antennas offline for months at a time, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=263.0s)]
*  which can increase pressure on the already overburdened network. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=267.0s)]
*  We've had issues of complexes going down that happened on Artemis. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=271.0s)]
*  We had a complex go down and we had to bring back up. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=274.0s)]
*  We've had axles break in our antennas. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=276.0s)]
*  The agency has also had difficulty building new infrastructure. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=279.0s)]
*  Its 2010 initiative to build six new antennas is nearly five years behind schedule. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=282.0s)]
*  When we talk about long term, it's challenging. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=287.0s)]
*  There will need to be investment to ensure that we can support the long term plans of NASA. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=289.0s)]
*  One potential fix? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=293.0s)]
*  A network of smaller antennas to specifically serve lunar missions [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=295.0s)]
*  so it can offload those missions from the DSN. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=298.0s)]
*  The first of these antennas is set to be built by 2026. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=301.0s)]
*  NASA is also testing the use of optical communication, or lasers, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=305.0s)]
*  on the spacecraft studying the Psyche asteroid. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=309.0s)]
*  Psyche has a tech demo on it right now. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=312.0s)]
*  So instead of sending radio frequency signals through an antenna, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=314.0s)]
*  it will use a laser to encode data. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=318.0s)]
*  Baldwin says the DSN is also leaning on other space agencies around the world, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=321.0s)]
*  borrowing their antenna networks when needed. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=325.0s)]
*  They did help us with Artemis 1 when we had to shift some of the missions [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=328.0s)]
*  over to other international agencies. We did that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=332.0s)]
*  We are going to explore that for Artemis 2 and beyond as well. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=335.0s)]
*  Despite these efforts, Baldwin says the DSN isn't out of the woods yet. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=339.0s)]
*  We're concerned, right? Maintaining schedule is key and difficult [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=343.0s)]
*  with some uncertainty in the budget. So I'd be remiss to say that there's no worry that we're all good. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=348.0s)]
*  For the first time in 50 years, the DSN is going to be supporting human spaceflight, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=353.0s)]
*  but we're also supporting all of these other missions. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=357.0s)]
*  So it's a different load on the DSN than what we've had recently. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=359.0s)]
*  For the public to know that we are being good stewards of taxpayer dollars [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=362.0s)]
*  and ensuring that we can bring down that investment that they made into the science exploration, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=366.0s)]
*  I think is key. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hkbv3H4ulw&t=371.0s)]
