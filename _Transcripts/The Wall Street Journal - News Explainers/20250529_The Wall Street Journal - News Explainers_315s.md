# How Trump's Golden Dome Missile Defense Will Work | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY)
*  The Golden Dome for America is game-changer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump's Golden Dome plan might look simple here, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=2.16s)]
*  but if the $175 billion missile defense shield is going to work the way he wants it to, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  the U.S. will need to put technology into space that is incredibly complex. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=10.88s)]
*  In some cases, we're talking about satellites that don't even exist yet. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=14.8s)]
*  The only time that I can think of in the history of the United States where we have [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=18.16s)]
*  gone after something this complex was the Manhattan Project. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=21.52s)]
*  In the short term, experts say we'll probably see more existing defense systems placed around the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=24.88s)]
*  country. Long term, those systems will have to interact with hundreds of satellites that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=29.52s)]
*  are supposed to detect, track, and eventually even intercept high-tech missiles from space. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=34.48s)]
*  That's because competitors like China and Russia are racing to develop missiles [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=40.16s)]
*  that can maneuver and evade current defenses. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=44.0s)]
*  I think innovation is going to continue and we can't [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  imagine or predict what our competitor nations are going to come up with. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=49.84s)]
*  Here's what the Golden Dome could ultimately look like and why some worry that it will fuel [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=53.28s)]
*  dangerous arms race in space. To understand why officials say the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=57.92s)]
*  Golden Dome is needed, you first have to understand how missile technology is advancing. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=62.4s)]
*  We'll start with the standard Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, or ICBM, which travels in a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=67.36s)]
*  high arc. This kind of missile, boosted by a rocket, travels to its peak hundreds of miles [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=72.8s)]
*  above the earth and then is brought down by gravity. ICBMs are very dangerous. They can [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=77.92s)]
*  carry multiple nuclear warheads and even be shot from submarines. But their trajectory is [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=83.36s)]
*  predictable, making them easier to detect and track with radar. So several defense systems are [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=88.48s)]
*  capable of shooting one of these down. Now there's a newer and more dangerous [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=93.76s)]
*  intercontinental missile called the Fractional Orbital Bombardment System, or FOBS. These can [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=98.16s)]
*  fly much lower. This kind of weapon is launched into a partial or fractional orbit. Since it [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=103.68s)]
*  doesn't travel in a high arc, the weapon can fly under the radar for much of its flight. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=109.6s)]
*  It's capable of reaching its target much faster and, crucially, it can approach from unexpected [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=114.0s)]
*  angles, meaning defenses don't know when or where it's coming down. Another newer threat is the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  Boosted Hypersonic Glide Weapon, which is an intercontinental missile that can maneuver and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=124.32s)]
*  evade defenses. These missiles are launched into space and ultimately travel at extremely fast [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=129.44s)]
*  speeds, greater than Mach 5. And after they enter the atmosphere, they maneuver to their targets on [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=135.12s)]
*  a glide vehicle. Because they can glide at low altitudes and change course midair, they can be [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=140.48s)]
*  extremely hard to detect and counter. So how will the Golden Dome help upgrade the US's defenses to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=145.6s)]
*  counter these new threats? The US already has a network of satellites that scans for infrared [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=152.48s)]
*  signatures, so they can detect when and where missiles launch. But those satellites can't [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=157.6s)]
*  determine the type of missiles being fired. The maneuverability, the gliding, the outmaneuvering [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=162.24s)]
*  of our defenses, those are all the challenges that we're trying to address. So we need a sensor [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=168.88s)]
*  layer that can keep track and custody of all of these objects as they are maneuvering. A sensor [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  layer, which the Pentagon has already been developing, is a network of tracking satellites [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=179.68s)]
*  that President Trump wants to expedite. By launching hundreds and eventually even thousands of sensors [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=183.92s)]
*  into orbit, the US says it will be able to detect and importantly track missiles as they maneuver [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=189.04s)]
*  and change course. Officials say the system will be able to calculate where a missile is heading [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=194.4s)]
*  so that defense systems can intercept it. But the Golden Dome won't stop there. The US wants to field [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=199.44s)]
*  even more ambitious and controversial space technology that hasn't even been fully developed [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  yet. We're talking about space interceptors. It's not clear what the design is. The satellite might [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=211.04s)]
*  contain multiple interceptors as in like a mother and daughter. It's not clear what the design is, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=216.16s)]
*  what the US will end up pursuing. Whatever they end up looking like, these interceptors will, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=221.28s)]
*  in theory, be key because they'll be able to take out missiles much earlier in their flight. However, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=225.84s)]
*  this is where things get very controversial. If you put interceptors in space, you could potentially [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=231.44s)]
*  do a lot more than just take out missile threats. You could imagine them being used offensively, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=236.8s)]
*  let's say, to take out satellites belonging to China or Russia. It's no surprise those countries, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=241.76s)]
*  America's biggest competitors in space, have come out against the Golden Dome. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=247.04s)]
*  Our enemies are very unhappy about it. You've been hearing, you've been reading, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  why are they doing that? Why? Well, we're doing it because we want to be around for a long time. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=265.2s)]
*  That's why we're doing it. President Trump has said the Golden Dome will cost $175 billion and be [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=270.8s)]
*  done by the end of his term. Though experts say it could cost billions more and take much longer to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=276.88s)]
*  build out. That is, if it's actually ever finished. Previous presidents, most notably Ronald Reagan, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=282.16s)]
*  have attempted ambitious missile defense efforts in the past. What must be recognized is that our [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=287.92s)]
*  security is based on being prepared to meet all threats. Those initiatives fell short because of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=293.2s)]
*  high costs, technological shortcomings, and even pressure from foreign countries. The big question [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=299.84s)]
*  now is whether President Trump will be able to overcome those very same obstacles. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDazMp60SfY&t=305.03999999999996s)]
