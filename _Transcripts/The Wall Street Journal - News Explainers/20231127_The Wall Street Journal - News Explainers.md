# How China Is Upgrading Its Air Bases to Prepare for War With Taiwan  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ)
*  On China's southeastern coastline facing Taiwan is the Hui'an military airbase. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Since 2020, the airbase has been significantly upgraded [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=6.0s)]
*  with new hardened shelters, an extended runway and a new apron for jet fighters. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=10.0s)]
*  Hui'an is just one of at least a dozen Chinese airbases in southern China [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=18.0s)]
*  that have seen infrastructure upgrades in recent years. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=23.0s)]
*  Defense analysts say these changes are part of China's preparations for conflicts over Taiwan, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=28.0s)]
*  the self-governing island that Beijing claims and has pledged to take by force if necessary. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=34.0s)]
*  Here's how China has been upgrading its airbases to strengthen its military capabilities [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=40.0s)]
*  and what challenges that poses for Taiwan and its allies in the event of a conflict. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=46.0s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal asked security analysts to study satellite imagery [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=54.0s)]
*  of over a dozen airbases within 500 miles of Taiwan. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=59.0s)]
*  Alex Neil is a former defense analyst for the British government [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=64.0s)]
*  and specializes in Asia-Pacific security. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=68.0s)]
*  The modernization and the upgrades of these airbases has been specifically focused [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=71.0s)]
*  on the ability to move air assets to these airfields which are close to the theater of battle. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=79.0s)]
*  In its biannual defense report, Taiwan warned China's recent construction at airfields along the coastline [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=87.0s)]
*  is designed to seize air superiority in the event of war across the Taiwan Strait. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=94.0s)]
*  China's air force has been expanding its bases to accommodate a wide range of military aircraft [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=101.0s)]
*  ready for different types of combat. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=107.0s)]
*  These upgrades can be seen in the Longtian airfield, one of China's closest bases to Taiwan. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=111.0s)]
*  Longtian airfield is quite a special example of the PLA's modernization [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=117.0s)]
*  because it not only has an array of helicopters and fighter jets, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=124.0s)]
*  at one end of the airfield you can make out camouflaged hardened shelters [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=129.0s)]
*  which are housing UAVs, so large drones which can be in the air reconnoitering the battle space. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=134.0s)]
*  China has developed supersonic drones such as the WZ-8 capable of penetrating deep behind enemy radar systems. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=144.0s)]
*  A leaked paper from the Pentagon suggests the WZ-8 drone is based here at the Lu'an airbase [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=153.0s)]
*  and satellite imagery shows significant upgrades have taken place in recent years. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=160.0s)]
*  The leaked papers suggest the upgraded bases on China's southern coast [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=165.0s)]
*  would operate as potential landing fields for the drone during reconnaissance missions over Taiwan. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=169.0s)]
*  China has been working on the so-called survivability of its air assets in the face of a retaliatory strike [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=179.0s)]
*  by hardening the bunkers where aircraft are stored with layers of reinforced concrete and steel. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=186.0s)]
*  If we look at a close-up of this airfield here, you can see hardened shelters in this area. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=193.0s)]
*  So aircraft on the apron would be able to advance quite quickly into these hardened shelters, to refuel them, to arm them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=201.0s)]
*  The purpose of hardening shelters is to ensure aircraft can survive direct strikes on an airbase, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=212.0s)]
*  allowing jet fighters to keep flying once a conflict has started. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=218.0s)]
*  If there were an immediate threat to the airfield itself through missiles launched at sea or indeed Taiwanese or US aircraft, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=223.0s)]
*  it would be to be able to withstand a preemptive strike or to have a second strike capability. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=232.0s)]
*  A number of the airbases, like Anqing, also have runways with direct access to mountain bunkers. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=239.0s)]
*  Under this mountain, there will be munitions storage facilities, as well as fuel and potentially accommodation [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=246.0s)]
*  for military personnel sheltering during an attack on the airfield. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=255.0s)]
*  The satellite images show work has been undertaken to harden the entrances to these bunkers, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=262.0s)]
*  replacing exposed entrances with what appear to be reinforced structures topped with a camouflage layer. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=268.0s)]
*  Analysts say these changes are part of China's preparations to maintain its air force in the event of a conflict. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=275.0s)]
*  The Chinese military is also enhancing the survivability of its airbases by constructing new air defence units. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=283.0s)]
*  If you look at this, you can see this cog-type configuration, which has a perimeter fence, its own accommodation, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=291.0s)]
*  hardened sheds for the missile batteries and radar capabilities, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=298.0s)]
*  which would rapidly deploy onto this cog to provide air defence. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=304.0s)]
*  Surface-to-air defence systems are designed to protect ground positions from air attacks. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=310.0s)]
*  These systems are capable of protecting airfields from multiple threats, including high-altitude bombers. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=316.0s)]
*  So these air defence facilities are not just for the airfield, but they're more broadly speaking a joined-up chain of air defence. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=323.0s)]
*  China's Ministry of Defence didn't respond to a request for comments on the recent upgrades of its airbases. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=333.0s)]
*  US officials say China's military is rapidly catching up to Western air forces. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=341.0s)]
*  It's clear that there's been a saturation of this whole area with airbases. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=347.0s)]
*  The United States and its allies are also needing to use their own geographical reach in order to counter this saturation. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=354.0s)]
*  If China were to invade Taiwan, Beijing knows it could spark a wider conflict in the region. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=367.0s)]
*  There's no doubt, as demonstrated by the hardening of these bases, that the PLA military leadership is aware that [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=374.0s)]
*  they will be big targets for the United States and Taiwanese forces if there were to be a cross-strait invasion. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuCx5FCVyQ&t=383.0s)]
