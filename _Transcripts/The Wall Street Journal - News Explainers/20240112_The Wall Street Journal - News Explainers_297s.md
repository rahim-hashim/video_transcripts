# Inside China’s Strategy to Sabotage Taiwan’s Elections | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA)
*  In July, a story began to circulate of a top-secret meeting between Taiwan and the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=0.0s)]
*  A newspaper had published a summary from a secret meeting in the South China Sea. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=5.04s)]
*  At the meeting, U.S. officials had reportedly asked Taiwan to research and develop biological weapons [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=8.56s)]
*  in a high-security laboratory at the National Defense Medical Center in Taipei. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=13.44s)]
*  The report began to spread across local media in Taiwan. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=17.44s)]
*  The U.S. State Department has denied a report saying that the U.S. asked Taiwan to develop biological weapons. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Develop bio-weapons. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=25.92s)]
*  The only problem? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  None of it was true. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=29.2s)]
*  As part of what analysts and Taiwanese government officials say was a Chinese disinformation campaign. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=30.32s)]
*  Ahead of Taiwan's presidential elections, there's been a striking increase in disinformation attacks targeting the island, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  which the government and analysts attribute to China. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=40.96s)]
*  Taiwan's government says Beijing wants to influence the elections because whoever next occupies the presidential palace here [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=43.6s)]
*  is going to dictate Taiwan's relationship with China. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=49.84s)]
*  We have seen the Chinese cognitive warfare and disinformation campaign, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=52.8s)]
*  and I think they have sharpened their tools in this regard. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=58.0s)]
*  Every day we have hundreds of battlefields about misleading information on social media. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=61.12s)]
*  China's communist government has never ruled Taiwan, but it claims it is part of its territory. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=67.6s)]
*  In recent years, China has stepped up military exercises around the self-ruled island of 24 million people. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=72.24s)]
*  Now Taiwan is going to the polls to vote for its next president. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=79.2s)]
*  The two main parties are the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=82.32s)]
*  which has forged tighter ties with the U.S. under President Tsai Ing-wen, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  and the opposition Kuomintang, which favors friendlier relations with China. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=88.55999999999999s)]
*  Leading up to the vote, the Taiwanese government has seen a wave of disinformation pointing to Beijing, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  with many of the attacks designed to cast doubt on the island's relationship with the U.S. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=96.72s)]
*  Taiwan's foreign minister says these attacks are part of an effort to influence voters. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=100.63999999999999s)]
*  It will all be different kinds of scenarios portrayed by the Chinese side. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=104.56s)]
*  For example, they continue to say that the choice in this election is in between war and peace, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=110.8s)]
*  and if you vote for the DPP's candidate, it will mean war. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=116.0s)]
*  What are you seeing this year compared to previous years? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=120.08s)]
*  Is it worse, better, different, and how concerned are you about it? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=122.72s)]
*  The Chinese always try to play its role, and they try to influence the outcome of the election one way or another. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=127.12s)]
*  In the previous times, they went through military threat against Taiwan, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=134.72s)]
*  and this time around, we noticed that China has been gearing up its cognitive warfare [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=139.36s)]
*  and disinformation campaign against Taiwan. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  As the vote nears, researchers are working to identify and counter disinformation targeting the election. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=147.84s)]
*  They are trying to manipulate Taiwanese people's opinion against the ruling party. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  Ethan Du is the founder of Taiwan AI Labs, an NGO that uses artificial intelligence to trawl through social media [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=158.96s)]
*  to identify trends and instances of misleading information. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  Taiwan is number one in terms of the foreign government's false information. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=168.4s)]
*  11 years in a row. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=173.2s)]
*  So in Taiwan, overall, every day, every individual has received some kind of information manipulation. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=175.28s)]
*  Taiwan receives thousands of disinformation attacks every day that mirror Chinese state media narratives. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=183.92s)]
*  In the two months leading up to the vote, attacks peaked at more than 15,000 a day. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=189.28s)]
*  We believe that there's a consistent funding support to manipulate the democracy country's election in Taiwan. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=193.52s)]
*  And the reason of that is Taiwan is at a very unique position between the United States and China. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=202.88s)]
*  Beijing has threatened action against any perceived moves by Taiwan to assert independence. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  China is trying to influence the election because it doesn't want this man, William Lai, to win. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=214.56s)]
*  Beijing sees Lai as an advocate for Taiwanese independence, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=218.96s)]
*  and it worries that Taiwan will move further away if he becomes president. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=222.0s)]
*  Lai is currently serving as Taiwan's vice president, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=225.92s)]
*  and has said he would maintain the status quo in relations with China established by President Tsai. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=228.16s)]
*  The surge in disinformation comes amid efforts by Beijing to ramp up military and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=252.0s)]
*  But China has denied that it's trying to interfere in the upcoming election. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=257.12s)]
*  Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office said accusations of Chinese interference in the election are false, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=260.56s)]
*  and that it respects the island's current social system. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=265.12s)]
*  Chinese leader Xi Jinping has vowed to eventually take control of the island, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=268.0s)]
*  making it a key point for the country to move forward. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=271.84s)]
*  But the Chinese government has also denied that it's trying to interfere in the upcoming election. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=274.64s)]
*  Xi Jinping has vowed to eventually take control of the island, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=279.36s)]
*  making Taiwan's status a flashpoint in relations between the US and China. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=282.16s)]
*  Whoever wins this election will set the course of Taipei's relationship with Beijing at a critical moment. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFz_195hPA&t=286.40000000000003s)]
