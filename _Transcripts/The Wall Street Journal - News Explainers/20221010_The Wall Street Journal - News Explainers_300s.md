# The Chess Cheating Scandal, Explained  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg)
*  The world of competitive chess was upended in September when 19-year-old American grandmaster [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=0.0s)]
*  Han Smoky Nieman was accused of cheating by five-time world champion Magnus Carlson. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=6.66s)]
*  The allegations surfaced last month after Carlson abruptly withdrew from the Sinkfield [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Cup in St. Louis after losing a game against Nieman. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=17.02s)]
*  It must be embarrassing for the world champion to lose to me. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=20.32s)]
*  About two weeks later, during a Carlson-Nieman rematch, Carlson resigned after making just [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=24.04s)]
*  one move. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=29.18s)]
*  What? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=30.18s)]
*  No. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=31.18s)]
*  Carlson then explicitly accused Nieman of cheating, saying he hoped the truth in this [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=32.18s)]
*  matter comes out, whatever it may be. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=38.54s)]
*  The cheating allegations against Nieman grew louder on October 4th when Chess.com released [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=41.66s)]
*  an investigation it conducted into Nieman's matches. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=46.42s)]
*  The report alleged that he cheated more than 100 times in online games as recently as 2020. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=49.94s)]
*  Nieman denied cheating during the Sinkfield Cup or in any in-person chess match, but [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=55.98s)]
*  the grandmaster did admit he's cheated at two points in his life, once as a 12-year-old [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=60.54s)]
*  and in other random games at age 16. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=65.34s)]
*  In an absolutely ridiculous mistake, in an unrated game, after that, when I was 12, I [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=67.66s)]
*  have never ever in my life cheated in an over-the-board game, in an online tournament. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=72.86s)]
*  But now, with the integrity of the game under scrutiny, many are asking, how could someone [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=77.82s)]
*  cheat at chess? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=82.53999999999999s)]
*  In the age of smartphones and software, today's cheaters can use computer programs known as [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=85.66s)]
*  chess engines. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=90.78s)]
*  Chess engines first entered the public consciousness in 1997 when the chess computer known as Deep [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=92.78s)]
*  Blue beat the then world champion Garry Kasparov. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=97.89999999999999s)]
*  Deep Blue's victory was a milestone as it was the first time a computer beat a world [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  champion. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=105.62s)]
*  But today, these programs are widely available. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=106.66s)]
*  Anyone can download one on their smartphone. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=109.86s)]
*  They're also powerful. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=112.62s)]
*  Computer and chess engines are now capable of beating even the best human every single [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=114.34s)]
*  time. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=118.54s)]
*  But if someone wanted to cheat by using a computer, they'd have to do so without being [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=119.54s)]
*  noticed. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=123.82000000000001s)]
*  So, how could the computer get information to the cheating player unseen? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  One of the best-known methods involves trips to the bathroom to secretly look at a phone [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=130.1s)]
*  equipped with a chess engine. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=134.82s)]
*  Since experienced players are able to memorize the board and input it into chess software, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=137.06s)]
*  they don't necessarily need a collaborator to cheat. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=142.46s)]
*  In 2019, Latvian Grandmaster Igoris Roussis confessed to cheating on four different occasions [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=146.46s)]
*  in three instances by using his mobile phone. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=152.94s)]
*  But if a cheater weren't going to the bathroom too many times, how would they get instructions [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=155.86s)]
*  and avoid detection? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=160.38s)]
*  One option would be coordinating with an accomplice who uses a chess engine and then sends moves [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=162.68s)]
*  to a device hidden somewhere on the player's body. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=167.86s)]
*  That gadget could be a tiny vibrator or a nearly invisible earpiece. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=170.94s)]
*  Something as small as a quick buzz could indicate that the best tactic is, say, a knight move [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=176.34s)]
*  rather than a pawn. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=181.5s)]
*  A player could also receive signals from someone in the audience. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=183.1s)]
*  Since chess players only need a few moments of help throughout a game, cheating can be [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=187.22s)]
*  hard to catch during an in-person game. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=191.02s)]
*  But the website chess.com has developed sophisticated methods to uncover unethical gameplay. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=193.86s)]
*  The website recently closed over 18,000 accounts due to cheating. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=199.5s)]
*  Chess.com said it was able to identify matches where Nieman likely cheated in online games [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=204.18s)]
*  using two main methods. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=209.52s)]
*  First, they looked at Nieman's moves and compared them to those recommended by chess [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=211.3s)]
*  engines with analytic software. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=215.68s)]
*  The website also monitored Nieman to see what windows he pulled up during the game. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=217.86s)]
*  When players compete online, they have certain screen and data sharing protocols they must [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=222.88s)]
*  agree to with organizers who usually mandate webcams as well. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=227.66s)]
*  Chess.com said it found that Nieman performed much better while toggling between screens [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=231.57999999999998s)]
*  during games. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=236.66s)]
*  The second way chess.com said that it determined Nieman was likely cheating was by studying [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=238.5s)]
*  his past performances to get a sense of his strengths and weaknesses. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=243.06s)]
*  By comparing the moves a player makes against the moves a computer would make, the chess [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=247.1s)]
*  site developed a strength score to determine if a player is playing a better game than [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=251.01999999999998s)]
*  their skill level. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=255.26s)]
*  Nieman hasn't responded to requests for comment. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=256.98s)]
*  Last month, he said he dedicated himself to in-person chess after he'd been caught cheating [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=259.62s)]
*  to prove himself as a player. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=264.3s)]
*  Although no one has proven that Nieman did in fact cheat in his match against Carlson, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=266.18s)]
*  many chess fans see chess.com's investigation as damning. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=270.46000000000004s)]
*  Nieman himself has even praised the website for its analysis. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  They have the best cheat detection in the world. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=277.90000000000003s)]
*  And due to that analysis, chess.com has barred Nieman from its $1 million global championship. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=280.1s)]
*  When Nieman questioned the decision, he was told by chess.com that there always remain [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=286.18s)]
*  serious concerns about his cheating in prize events and that there was too much at stake. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg5G1A_mTFg&t=290.22s)]
