# Why U.S.-Saudi Economic Ties Complicate Diplomacy
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 25, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20)
*  The U.S. and Saudi Arabia have deep ties that go back decades, ties that connect Washington and Riyadh and both countries' economies. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=0.0s)]
*  The countries are so intertwined economically that Washington is often reluctant to distance itself from Riyadh politically. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=10.24s)]
*  The current tension over the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi is no exception. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=17.72s)]
*  Here's a look at some of the glue that's binding the two powers together. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=23.56s)]
*  First, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. are connected by oil. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  The U.S. has doubled production of crude over the past decade and is now considered the world's largest producer. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=32.64s)]
*  But it still looks to Saudi Arabia for nearly 10 percent of its petroleum imports. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=38.8s)]
*  And there's more. Saudi Arabia holds the power to quickly influence global oil prices. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  Some call it the central bank of oil. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=49.96s)]
*  That's because in Saudi Arabia, the state controls oil production, which allows for a more streamlined operation than in countries like the U.S., where hundreds of private companies work independently across numerous states. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=52.68s)]
*  The kingdom has the power to turn the flow up and down quickly, impacting gas prices, inflation and global growth. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=65.84s)]
*  Saudi financiers have also forged close relationships with American companies, especially in tech and finance. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=73.52s)]
*  That's because Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has set the ambitious goal of making Saudi Arabia a major investment hub in an effort to diversify the country's economy beyond oil. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=81.28s)]
*  Using the country's public investment fund, the Saudis have directly invested three point five billion dollars in Uber, which gave PIF's chief a seat on the company's board, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=92.0s)]
*  taken a roughly five percent stake in Tesla, which fueled speculation that it could take over the company someday, and committed forty five billion dollars to a tech fund managed by SoftBank, a Japanese firm that's investing heavily in U.S. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=102.92s)]
*  startups like WeWork. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=116.48s)]
*  Since 2016, the kingdom has become the biggest single source of funding for U.S. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=118.4s)]
*  startups. Ties are also growing stronger with Wall Street. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=123.04s)]
*  PIF committed up to 20 billion dollars for an infrastructure fund managed by Blackstone. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  And BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has met with the Crown Prince about possible investment partnerships and is planning to open an office in Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=132.76s)]
*  However, there's one caveat. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  Some of Saudi Arabia's ambitious business plans have been put on hold due to the stalled IPO of Saudi Aramco, the country's massive state-owned oil company. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  Then there are the arms and defense deals. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=153.44s)]
*  For decades, the U.S. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=156.08s)]
*  has provided military support for Saudi Arabia and the kingdom has purchased tens of billions of dollars of weapons and defense systems from the United States. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=157.44s)]
*  The U.S. defense industry is so entrenched in Saudi Arabia that some American companies are establishing joint ventures to make and repair equipment in Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=166.44s)]
*  In 2017, the U.S. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=176.28s)]
*  and Saudi Arabia announced an arms deal they said could eventually be worth 110 billion dollars. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=178.08s)]
*  That's peanuts for you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=184.4s)]
*  You should have increased it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=185.68s)]
*  These contracts, some of which have yet to be approved, would benefit a handful of U.S. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=187.32000000000002s)]
*  companies. Lockheed Martin said in a statement that it amassed 28 billion dollars in potential new business from Saudi Arabia, including the planned sale of combat ships and helicopters that would be assembled at a new plant in Saudi Arabia, creating 450 jobs there. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=191.88000000000002s)]
*  It also struck a deal to sell its THAAD missile defense system to the kingdom. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  Raytheon said it was setting up a new Saudi-based defense arm encompassing munitions and cybersecurity, and Boeing was approved to sell Saudi Arabia seven billion dollars in Chinook and Apache helicopters, and it announced a joint venture in March that would create 6,000 Saudi jobs. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=213.24s)]
*  Boeing has said its share of the planned deals could be worth as much as 50 billion dollars. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=229.36s)]
*  Trump has made it clear he does not want to jeopardize deals like these, even in light of political controversies. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=235.0s)]
*  If we don't sell it to them, they'll say, well, thank you very much. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=241.88s)]
*  We'll buy it from Russia or thank you very much. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=244.96s)]
*  We'll buy it from China. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=247.44s)]
*  So what good does that do us? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=248.56s)]
*  There are other things we can do. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=250.44s)]
*  Some U.S. business leaders have distanced themselves from the kingdom after Khashoggi's disappearance by pulling out of the Saudi conference dubbed Davos in the desert. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=252.0s)]
*  But the country's economic ties run deep and the alliance has proven to be a resilient one. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=260.92s)]
*  The U.S. government has been very careful in its efforts to protect the country's interests. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=271.0s)]
*  It has been very careful in its efforts to protect the country's interests. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7D5UywF_20&t=276.0s)]
