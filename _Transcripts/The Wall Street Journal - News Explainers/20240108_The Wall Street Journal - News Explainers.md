# Trump’s Civil-Fraud Trial, Explained What’s at Stake?  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE)
*  Before Donald Trump became president, he was better known for this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=0.0s)]
*  You're fired. You're fired. You're fired. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=4.68s)]
*  Donald Trump was known through and through as a New Yorker, a businessman, a socialite essentially. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=7.12s)]
*  That reputation is now at the center of Trump's civil fraud trial in Manhattan, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  where he and his adult children face allegations that they falsified the value of their assets for millions in ill-gotten gains. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=17.64s)]
*  This is a rare scenario where you have a case of this financial significance with a player of this public visibility [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=24.96s)]
*  and involving so much real estate or so many assets in New York. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=33.08s)]
*  Here's how Trump's civil fraud trial could deal a blow to the former president's New York empire [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  and the business titan persona he's built over the course of decades. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=43.64s)]
*  Trump faces four criminal indictments related to his time as president. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=49.08s)]
*  But for him, the civil fraud case in Manhattan court is personal. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=52.68s)]
*  This could have potentially crippling effects on Donald Trump's business interests in New York [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=56.28s)]
*  and the Trump organization's ability to continue to do business in New York. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=62.44s)]
*  He spent decades pursuing business deals across the city, residential, commercial. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=65.76s)]
*  In a 2022 lawsuit, New York Attorney General Letitia James accused Trump and his adult children [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=72.88s)]
*  of engaging in a decade-long scheme to fraudulently and falsely value their assets, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=78.92s)]
*  resulting in $250 million in unlawful gains. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=83.92s)]
*  James, a Democrat and a vocal critic of Trump, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=88.16s)]
*  alleges the former president was able to obtain bank loans on more favorable terms by overvaluing his real estate. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=90.72s)]
*  These properties include Trump's flagship Manhattan building, Trump Tower, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  an office building known as 40 Wall Street, the residential building, Trump Park Avenue, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  and in a state north of New York City known as 7 Springs. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=106.48s)]
*  Cases like this are not rare, but this is one of the most unusual ones [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=110.36s)]
*  because of the high-profile identity of the person involved, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=116.32s)]
*  the fact that it involves a substantial number of properties with high values in New York. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=120.48s)]
*  The lawsuit said the triplex apartment in Trump Tower was calculated at 30,000 square feet, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  when in reality it's nearly 11,000 square feet. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=132.32s)]
*  That resulted in a valuation of $327 million in 2015, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=135.48s)]
*  more than triple the record-setting price for any apartment ever sold in the city at that point. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=140.6s)]
*  And at Trump Park Avenue, the lawsuit claimed 12 rent-stabilized units were appraised at $750,000 total. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  According to Trump's financial statements in 2011 and 2012, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  those units were valued as if they were unrestricted for nearly $50 million. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=157.0s)]
*  In the law, there is no bright line between what constitutes a reasonable, perhaps, exaggeration. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=162.44s)]
*  But when you get to the point where the statement of value is so many multiples, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=170.44s)]
*  10, 20, 100 times what would be shown to be the actual value, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=176.76s)]
*  a judge or jury can draw the conclusion if he wishes, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=181.36s)]
*  and it would be justified that this is a fraud. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=184.8s)]
*  Trump has denied any wrongdoing and called the case a witch hunt. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=189.84s)]
*  His lawyers have argued that his business dealings have been profitable for the banks involved. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  The banks got back their money. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=198.0s)]
*  Again, there was never a default. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=200.56s)]
*  There was never a problem. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  Everything was perfect. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=203.84s)]
*  There was no crime. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=205.48s)]
*  In the early proceedings before the trial, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=206.92s)]
*  a New York judge ruled that Trump and two of his adult children, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=208.96s)]
*  Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., committed fraud. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=212.44s)]
*  Both Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have criticized the ruling, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=215.88s)]
*  saying they relied on the company's accountants to compile their father's financial statements. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=219.52s)]
*  Ivanka Trump was dismissed from the case after an appeals court ruled the state's legal claims against her were too old. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=224.72s)]
*  In September, the judge ordered the cancellation of business certificates that allow Trump to operate in the state, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=231.24s)]
*  which could lead him to lose control of some New York properties. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=236.96s)]
*  You can't just take assets from somebody without compensation. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=240.88s)]
*  If this goes forward, there has to be a process, which is certainly fair to the defendant, to Trump, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=244.64s)]
*  to realize the proper value of those assets. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=249.68s)]
*  Whether or not that Trump name is going to come off the buildings is very much intertwined [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  with what is the way to realize the most value if those assets are sold. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=258.12s)]
*  Trump is not hiding at all his displeasure with this entire process. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=266.76s)]
*  This is a case that should have never been brought. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=270.68s)]
*  It's a case that should be dismissed immediately. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=273.64s)]
*  The fraud was on behalf of the court. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=276.44s)]
*  The attorney general wants to prohibit Trump and his company from entering into New York State commercial real estate acquisitions [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  and applying for loans with state-registered lenders for five years. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=285.28s)]
*  In early January, James said Trump and his company should pay about $370 million in penalties, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=289.36s)]
*  more than the $250 million she originally estimated for their ill-gotten gains. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  There's a lot of questions of where Trump would get the cash freed up to satisfy that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=301.48s)]
*  One possibility is he would have to sell some properties off or other assets to free up that amount of cash. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=306.08s)]
*  In October, an appeals court temporarily postponed the cancellation of Trump's business certificates [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=313.16s)]
*  while his lawyers contested the ruling. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=318.48s)]
*  The irony here is if this goes forward and Trump is no longer involved, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=321.0s)]
*  the very thing that he says would lend extraordinary value to these properties beyond, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  for example, the appraisal values, would haunt him because these properties would no longer have the Trump brand [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=330.56s)]
*  and the values that would be realized, one would think would be substantially lower. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=337.0s)]
*  Some legal experts say Trump's lawyers seem focused on building a detailed legal record for an appeal. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=342.16s)]
*  The appellate road is long and it is not quick. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=348.04s)]
*  And if we consider where we are now, I think that the scale tips heavily in favor of the Trump organization [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=352.12s)]
*  in being able to delay any final resolution of this case until after the next presidential election. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=359.0s)]
*  Politically, Trump has so far used this and the other legal travails that he faces [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=366.0s)]
*  to paint himself as a victim of political persecution. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=371.79999999999995s)]
*  In a lot of ways, it's worked with Republican core voters, but a loss could kind of turn the tables on that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=375.15999999999997s)]
*  Some of his legal problems could compound and he could be hurt in the face of voters [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=381.64s)]
*  as he tries to return to the White House. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0DNFFXfThE&t=387.16s)]
