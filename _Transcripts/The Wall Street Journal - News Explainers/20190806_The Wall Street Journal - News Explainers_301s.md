# Why Are Wages Low in the Growing Job Market?  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 06, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4)
*  Right now in the U.S. labor market, we're looking at two numbers. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=0.0s)]
*  The first is 106. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=5.88s)]
*  That's the number of consecutive months the U.S. labor market has added jobs, the most [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=8.16s)]
*  ever recorded. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=12.42s)]
*  The second is 3.2%. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=14.6s)]
*  That's about how much wages have grown each month in 2019 from a year earlier. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=17.12s)]
*  In a healthy economy, annual wage growth is usually around 3.5%. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=21.72s)]
*  So despite record-breaking jobs growth, wages aren't growing as fast as expected. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=27.12s)]
*  And many economists aren't sure we're going to see much of a pickup from here. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=31.96s)]
*  Let's take a closer look at the numbers. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  In theory, low unemployment should encourage employers to raise wages, since they're competing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=46.36s)]
*  to retain workers and also hire from a shrinking pool of employees. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=51.34s)]
*  But that's not what's happening. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=56.12s)]
*  Employee pay and benefits as a percentage of gross domestic income fell to 52.7% in [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=58.48s)]
*  last year's third quarter, marking the fourth straight quarterly decline. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  Compare that to when it was as high as 59% in 1970 and 57% in 2001. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=68.92s)]
*  In other words, if workers commanded as much domestic income as they did in 2001, they'd [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=76.4s)]
*  have nearly $800 billion more in their pockets, or $5,100 per employed American. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=82.04s)]
*  Economists have identified some forces contributing to this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=89.16000000000001s)]
*  One of the factors squeezing Americans out of higher wages is automation. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  Rapid advancements in robotics technology and artificial intelligence are expected to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=96.36000000000001s)]
*  displace millions of jobs in coming decades as routine tasks from driving trucks to checking [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=101.2s)]
*  out at the grocery store become automated. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=107.42s)]
*  The share of tasks at risk for food preparation workers, for example, is 91%. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=111.14s)]
*  Economists say workers in industries where automation is taking over jobs have less power [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=118.18s)]
*  to bargain for higher wages. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=122.58s)]
*  Analysts at the Brookings Institution say less educated workers are especially likely [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=125.18s)]
*  to have their jobs displaced by automation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=130.22s)]
*  So it ends up being these workers who have a harder time demanding higher wages. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=132.86s)]
*  Another contributing factor to slower wage growth is the decrease in unions. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=138.06s)]
*  Union membership in 2018 is about half of what it was in 1983. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=143.1s)]
*  That means the power to bargain for higher wages has decreased, and employment contracts [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=147.86s)]
*  have become less favorable for workers. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=152.1s)]
*  For example, employment contracts have become increasingly riddled with non-compete agreements. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=155.06s)]
*  Evan Starr, an economist at the University of Maryland, estimates that roughly one in [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=161.78s)]
*  7 workers making $40,000 or less sign non-competes. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=166.46s)]
*  His research found that states that enforce the clauses see lower wages across the course [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=171.70000000000002s)]
*  of workers' careers than states that don't. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=176.10000000000002s)]
*  That's because non-competes can discourage workers in low-paying jobs from looking elsewhere, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  since they might not be able to move from one company to another. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=183.42000000000002s)]
*  Even interns are increasingly being hit by non-competes, which can prevent them from [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=187.10000000000002s)]
*  moving on from temporary jobs to full-time gigs that would pay them more. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=191.26000000000002s)]
*  Another factor contributing to lower wage growth is the growing gig economy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=196.38s)]
*  With the growth of the freelance and gig economy, there's more uncertainty for workers. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=200.14s)]
*  This gives them less leverage for negotiation and fewer rights than full-time employees [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=204.94s)]
*  would receive. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=208.98s)]
*  In some cases, gig economy workers have been able to push for bigger paychecks. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=210.38s)]
*  New York passed laws in 2018 that required Lyft and Uber to pay drivers a minimum of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=214.98s)]
*  $17.22 an hour. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=220.01999999999998s)]
*  But that's not been the case everywhere. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=223.54s)]
*  Globalization is another reason why wage growth has been sluggish. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=225.86s)]
*  Because of increased competition from overseas where wages are sometimes lower, American [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=229.82000000000002s)]
*  companies are often reluctant to raise wages for U.S. workers. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=234.46s)]
*  U.S. companies have been outsourcing jobs to places like Mexico, China, and India, where [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=239.02s)]
*  they can produce goods for much cheaper. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=244.18s)]
*  That means U.S. workers have been left with less bargaining power when it comes to their [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=246.98000000000002s)]
*  own wages. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=250.36s)]
*  The idea being, if your boss can find a worker overseas who's willing to take a much smaller [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=251.7s)]
*  paycheck, why would they be willing to pay you more? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=256.38s)]
*  For example, Mexican vehicle assembly workers made less than $8 an hour on average in 2017. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=260.26s)]
*  In comparison, the median wage for North American workers in the auto manufacturing industry [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=267.3s)]
*  was $15 to $16 an hour. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=272.34s)]
*  So how do we predict wage growth will change in the future? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=275.32s)]
*  Is this slower growth expected to continue? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=278.5s)]
*  It's tough to say how this will play out. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=282.06s)]
*  But members of Congress are pushing for legislation to increase the minimum wage. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=284.18s)]
*  And recently, the House did pass the Raise the Wage Act, although people say it's probably [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=288.84s)]
*  unlikely to make it through the Senate. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KrU2kG4t4&t=294.18s)]
