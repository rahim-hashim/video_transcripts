Video Description: China says its newly equipped Tiangong space station will be up and running by next year while the future of the nearly 23-year-old International Space Station remains uncertain after 2024. China says its spacecraft has more advanced technology, like a more efficient propulsion system and a tag-along space telescope. 

WSJ unpacks the design and technology of both space stations and takes a look at China’s history in space exploration.

# Tiangong: Behind China’s Answer to the International Space Station | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 20, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY)
*  If you want to conduct experiments like this in space, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=0.0s)]
*  we are trying to grow edible plants. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=3.0s)]
*  this is the only place to do it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=5.0s)]
*  But soon, the International Space Station will have company. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=7.0s)]
*  In April, China launched the core part of its new space station, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=13.0s)]
*  called Tiangong, which means heavenly palace in Chinese. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=16.0s)]
*  This is a brand new modular space station. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=23.0s)]
*  There are many exciting things about it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=26.0s)]
*  China says Tiangong will be up and running by 2022, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=28.0s)]
*  becoming a research spacecraft that will orbit Earth alongside [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=31.0s)]
*  the nearly 23-year-old International Space Station. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=34.0s)]
*  NASA and its partner countries have agreed that the older spacecraft [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=37.0s)]
*  will operate through 2024, though its future after that is unclear. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=41.0s)]
*  If the International Space Station retires in 2024, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=45.0s)]
*  the Chinese space station will be the only permanent space station [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=48.0s)]
*  in low Earth orbit. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=52.0s)]
*  It means that China could have a very strong global presence [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=54.0s)]
*  and influence. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=57.0s)]
*  So here's what's on China's new space station [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=58.0s)]
*  and how it compares with the International one. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=60.0s)]
*  The first thing you have to know about China's space station, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=65.0s)]
*  it's building it all by itself. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=68.0s)]
*  And some of the reasons for that go back about a decade. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=70.0s)]
*  China is not part of the International Space Station. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=72.0s)]
*  Quinton Parker is the director of the Laboratory for Space Research [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=76.0s)]
*  at the University of Hong Kong. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=79.0s)]
*  He's been researching space science for over four decades. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=81.0s)]
*  They're primarily political around issues of trust [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=84.0s)]
*  and technology transfer, which is driven principally by the United States. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=88.0s)]
*  Since 2011, China has been excluded by U.S. law from working with NASA. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=92.0s)]
*  As a result, China's astronauts have not been allowed to set foot [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=96.0s)]
*  on the International Space Station, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=99.0s)]
*  which is a collaboration with five space agencies. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=101.0s)]
*  China's Foreign Ministry said that the U.S. is judging an upright man [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=104.0s)]
*  with a petty mind. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=108.0s)]
*  In some ways, it's been extremely beneficial to China, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=109.0s)]
*  because it's given China the impetus and the political will [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=111.0s)]
*  to move forward with their own very ambitious space endeavors. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=115.0s)]
*  And China's space station ambition has been 30 years in the making. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=122.0s)]
*  In 2003, it sent its first astronaut to space, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=127.0s)]
*  making it the third country after the U.S. and Russia to do that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=130.0s)]
*  Less than a decade later, China said it successfully launched two test modules, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=134.0s)]
*  which are the basis for any space station design. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=138.0s)]
*  These modules are then put together a bit like Lego. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=141.0s)]
*  The reason they're modular, of course, is you can't put the whole thing up in one go. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=144.0s)]
*  You have to put it up bit by bit using many launches. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=147.0s)]
*  The International Space Station currently has 16 modules, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=149.0s)]
*  whereas China only has one in orbit. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=152.0s)]
*  But eventually, Tiangong will be made up of three. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=155.0s)]
*  It's only about a quarter or so of the size of the current International Space Station. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=158.0s)]
*  Three people can live on a Chinese space station at the moment. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=163.0s)]
*  Compare that with the six people usually on board the International Space Station, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=166.0s)]
*  or in 2009, when there was a record total of 13 astronauts at one time. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=170.0s)]
*  And China could potentially reach that capacity too, just by adding more modules. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=175.0s)]
*  Thanks to this design, the International Space Station has been an evolving project since 1998. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=179.0s)]
*  So if one module has failed catastrophically or is no longer cutting it, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=185.0s)]
*  you can detach it and just reattach a new one. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=191.0s)]
*  While the Tiangong spacecraft is smaller, China says it's equipped with more advanced technology. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=195.0s)]
*  When you're the last kid on the block, you have the opportunity to do things [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=200.0s)]
*  at the last minute with the best technology around. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=203.0s)]
*  And one of them is a system that helps power Tiangong with solar panels. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=206.0s)]
*  The electricity generated from the panel wings essentially helps keep the lights on. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=217.0s)]
*  But one unique part about China's setup is that it also powers the spacecraft's propulsion technology. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=221.0s)]
*  So even though Tiangong still uses regular fuel propellants like the International Space Station, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=226.0s)]
*  China says it doesn't have to use as much to stay afloat in orbit. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=231.0s)]
*  If you're not using liquid or solid fuel propellant for your propulsion, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=235.0s)]
*  then you're not carrying that weight. Then that's a saving. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=239.0s)]
*  China's space agency says its propulsion system is about five times more efficient and powerful [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=242.0s)]
*  than the International Space Station's, which is a gas guzzler. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=247.0s)]
*  We're going to fire the engines on the aft end of the space station. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=250.0s)]
*  Consuming about nine tons of fuel annually to stay in orbit. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=254.0s)]
*  Another piece of equipment that the International Space Station doesn't have, a tag-along space telescope. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=258.0s)]
*  It's called Shuntian, which means heavenly cruiser in Chinese, and will orbit parallel to the space station. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=263.0s)]
*  A bit like the Hubble Space Telescope, but this will have an enormously large camera, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=269.0s)]
*  which can look at 300 times the field of view of the Hubble Space Telescope in one hit. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=275.0s)]
*  The Chinese telescope will be able to refuel and be serviced by directly docking at Tiangong, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=280.0s)]
*  unlike the Hubble Telescope, which because it orbits on its own, requires astronauts to fly in from Earth for repairs. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=285.0s)]
*  And one day, China's space telescope could be used by other countries, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=291.0s)]
*  because China has said its new space station is designed for collaborations. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=295.0s)]
*  So for China, international cooperation in space means its space capacity has legitimacy, and second, it can build influence. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=299.0s)]
*  Namrata Goswami is an independent researcher who's been studying global space policy for more than 20 years. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=308.0s)]
*  With the completion of the Chinese space station by 2022, that will be a competitive alignment for countries [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=313.0s)]
*  that want to choose which space station they would launch their experiments on. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=321.0s)]
*  Goswami says China's decision-making process could be very different from the International Space Station, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=327.0s)]
*  which requires consensus among its partners. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=332.0s)]
*  The Chinese space station is going to be operated by China. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=335.0s)]
*  Any decision to allow a particular scientific experiment to be conducted in the Chinese space station will, of course, be taken by China. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=338.0s)]
*  And more of these decisions could come soon, since Tiangong is set to be completed by 2022. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=358.0s)]
*  And that milestone is another one in just a few years, in addition to landing on the far side of the moon, to sending a rover to roam Mars. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=370.0s)]
*  It is very clear that China's investment in space is about turning China into aerospace power. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=378.0s)]
*  But China won't be the only one left to fill the vacancy when the International Space Station heads into retirement. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=385.0s)]
*  NASA is leading a plan to launch an outpost that will work like the International Space Station, but instead orbit the moon. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=391.0s)]
*  And Russia has indicated that it could launch its own space station by 2030. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=397.0s)]
*  Space is always seen as a part of geopolitics. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=401.0s)]
*  The competition that is ongoing is which country has the more attractive space capacity in low-Earth orbit and beyond. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8qxSfdPBSY&t=405.0s)]
