# Why the Fed Is Considering a Digital Dollar  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 28, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4)
*  The Federal Reserve might want to fix your wallet by turning it from this into this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=0.0s)]
*  Though your wallet is still designed for dollar bills, Americans have been using cash to buy [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=6.2s)]
*  things less and less over the years. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  That's part of why the Fed is considering digitizing the US dollar, giving people money [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=12.64s)]
*  they can access on their phone, and bypassing electronic payments that can be slow and costly [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=18.04s)]
*  for businesses. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=22.98s)]
*  Some see this as a necessary upgrade to the US financial system, but others worry it could [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  potentially upend commercial banking. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=29.62s)]
*  There are some very, very difficult questions to answer, but I think we, and we are engaged [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=32.18s)]
*  in a serious program to understand both the technology and the policy issues. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=36.06s)]
*  Essential bank digital currency, or CBDC, is exactly what it sounds like. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=43.3s)]
*  A purely digital form of a country's money issued by its central bank that people can [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  use just like cash. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=51.86s)]
*  It's true that cards and apps already allow for electronic payment, but behind the scenes, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=53.94s)]
*  these financial transactions involve several steps, settling payments over a patchwork [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=58.7s)]
*  of systems. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=63.220000000000006s)]
*  The plumbing of the system is still based on a cash system. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=64.22s)]
*  Josh Lipsky is the director of the Atlantic Council's Geoeconomic Center, and says the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=68.86s)]
*  US financial system is still pretty old school when it comes to moving money around. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=73.22s)]
*  You know, it's based on banks talking to banks, saying, hey, I need you to transfer this to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=77.78s)]
*  me. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=81.66s)]
*  We've updated some of that over the years, but he actually, if you were to look back, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=82.66s)]
*  a lot of it dates back to the 1950s and before, and that's not a great way to run a modern [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=86.06s)]
*  global economy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=91.3s)]
*  After a debit card is swiped, the transaction can flow through several entities, including [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=92.86s)]
*  point of sale systems, payment networks like Visa and MasterCard, your bank, and the Merchants [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=96.42s)]
*  Bank. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=101.69999999999999s)]
*  The system can take up to three days to move money between accounts, and often comes with [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=102.69999999999999s)]
*  transaction fees that can weigh heavily on small businesses, who experts say may have [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=106.25999999999999s)]
*  to pass the cost onto customers or put restrictions on card usage. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=110.69999999999999s)]
*  These extra costs can limit their revenues and customer base. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=115.02s)]
*  CBDCs could bypass this system, allowing digital money to flow directly between two people, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=118.86s)]
*  in the same way you hand over cash to the register. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=124.38s)]
*  One method the Fed is considering is issuing digital wallets to Americans directly, or [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=127.38s)]
*  through commercial banks or other financial service providers. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=131.94s)]
*  The digital dollars themselves would be no more than computer code, possibly stored on [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=135.7s)]
*  a central ledger at the Fed or on a distributed ledger like many cryptocurrencies. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=139.94s)]
*  When you use your wallet to pay for something, the Fed would take the digital cash out of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=144.68s)]
*  your wallet and deposit it into the merchants, simplifying the process and doing it without [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=148.24s)]
*  fees. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  These could be done through an app on a phone, or for those without smartphones, an SMS text [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=154.28s)]
*  message or debit card. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=158.8s)]
*  Besides frictionless payments, a digital dollar could help the 8.4 million unbanked households [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  who don't have a debit or credit card and can get left behind in a cashless world. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=165.84s)]
*  For example, instead of mailing checks, the government could deposit your tax refund or [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=170.32s)]
*  stimulus payments directly into your Fed wallet, making the money available immediately. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=174.16s)]
*  Proponents also say CBDCs offer a much more effective tool for central banks to enact [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=180.12s)]
*  monetary policy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=185.04s)]
*  Right now, the Fed influences interest rates across the entire economy by setting borrowing [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=186.72s)]
*  rates between banks, known as the federal funds rate. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=191.28s)]
*  But this is often a fraught process that doesn't always produce the desired results. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=194.88s)]
*  The Fed sets this benchmark rate and other private banks are supposed to queue off it [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  and then your mortgage is supposed to queue off it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  Does that really work? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=205.32s)]
*  How much time does it take? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=206.32s)]
*  And the answer that economists will tell you is it works, but there are probably more efficient [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=207.92s)]
*  ways to transfer monetary policy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  Economists believe that if the Federal Reserve were to assign interest rates to the money [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=214.11999999999998s)]
*  stored in digital wallets, it would be much more effective at influencing economic decision [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  making at the household level. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=222.67999999999998s)]
*  According to a January survey, 60 percent of central banks around the world are currently [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=224.56s)]
*  experimenting with CBDCs. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  The Bahamas was the first country to release a digital currency called the San Dollar in [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=231.2s)]
*  October 2020. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  And China has been developing and testing a digital version of the Yuan. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=236.88s)]
*  But there are questions about how a digital currency would work in the U.S. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=240.88s)]
*  Legitimate digital public money could help drive out bogus digital private money. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=245.16s)]
*  It could help improve financial inclusion, efficiency and the safety of our financial [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=252.04s)]
*  system if that digital public money is well designed and efficiently executed, which are [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=257.24s)]
*  two very big ifs. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=264.36s)]
*  The recent rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and private currencies like Facebook's Diom [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=267.76000000000005s)]
*  have spurred central banks to explore CBDCs in an effort to keep pace. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=272.52000000000004s)]
*  Experts say these alternative currencies expose the risk of money and payments circulating [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=277.52000000000004s)]
*  outside the watchful eyes of central banks. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  This is a blind spot for them because when they're setting monetary policy, they like [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=284.0s)]
*  to know how much money is in circulation, broadly how that money is being used. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=288.2s)]
*  And so that helps them understand the macroeconomics and the fundamentals of the economy at any [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=293.04s)]
*  given time. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=297.68s)]
*  But by keeping up with new competitors, CBDCs could threaten to leave traditional banking [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=298.88s)]
*  behind. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=303.04s)]
*  So if the Fed were to become a bank in a traditional sense and actually issue people money and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=304.04s)]
*  hold people's money directly, then you might hold less money in your Bank of America app. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=308.88s)]
*  And that would cut into their business model. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=313.52s)]
*  So they have to think about how digital currencies affect their business. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=316.0s)]
*  Because of these issues, the Federal Reserve is still studying the scope and structure [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=320.52s)]
*  of how a digital dollar would work and how it could be integrated into the current banking [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=324.08s)]
*  system. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=328.26s)]
*  The Fed doesn't want to start dealing with 300 million customers overnight. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=329.26s)]
*  You know, they're not equipped to do that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=332.64s)]
*  So you don't want to call up the Fed at midnight and say, I forgot my password. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=334.64s)]
*  This is not something the Fed wants to be doing or can do. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=338.24s)]
*  So they need to think about who to work with to deliver digital dollars. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=342.12s)]
*  The Fed would also have to tackle privacy concerns over how anonymous digital dollar [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=345.6s)]
*  payments should be and whether the money should be restricted to specific transactions or [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=349.88s)]
*  programmed to expire after a certain time period to encourage spending. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  It plans to release a discussion paper on the benefits and risks of a digital dollar [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=358.36s)]
*  this summer and has said it wouldn't move forward without support from Congress. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=362.2s)]
*  Many experts say the Fed will need to figure out a digital dollar to keep up with the pace [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=366.8s)]
*  of a rapidly changing global economy. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=370.66s)]
*  What that looks like remains to be seen, but it could mean using this a lot less. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8qZT33DX4&t=373.42s)]
