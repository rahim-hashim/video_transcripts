Video Description: As storms begin to batter the East and West coasts, officials rely on NOAA to predict storm paths and track hurricanes. But NOAA doesn’t just use satellites – it also uses drones to track storms. 

Gliders are torpedo-shaped drones that dive underneath the ocean’s surface to track water temperature. Saildrones track what’s happening on the surface of the ocean including wave height, wind speed and salinity. Aerial drones can be launched directly into the eye of a hurricane to give a wealth of new data about how these storms are intensifying.

WSJ explains the tech behind these three important drones and looks at how NOAA uses the data to predict storms.

# How High-Tech Drones Are Tracking the World’s Most Dangerous Hurricanes  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c)
*  This video is taken near the eye of a category four hurricane in the middle of the Atlantic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=0.0s)]
*  With waves as high as a four-story building and winds reaching 94 miles an hour [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=5.76s)]
*  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is sending three state-of-the-art drones each with its own important mission [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=11.0s)]
*  straight into the center of these monster storms [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  The drones are a new piece of technology that is helping us uncover [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=22.8s)]
*  Information about the storms that we didn't know before [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=27.68s)]
*  Let's take a look inside Noah's lab to see how the agency uses drones to dive, sail, and fly into parts of a hurricane [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=31.28s)]
*  Where humans could never go [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=38.96s)]
*  At the laboratory a team of Noah engineers work on this torpedo-shaped drone called the glider [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=42.68s)]
*  It's five feet long can weigh up to 150 pounds and it's controlled by drone pilots like Yuli Rivera [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=48.56s)]
*  A glider could cost anywhere from a hundred and seventy five thousand to two hundred thousand dollars [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=55.44s)]
*  Depending on what sensors are they're equipped with [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=61.04s)]
*  Those sensors are used to track storms half a mile beneath the ocean surface measuring water temperatures along the way [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=64.8s)]
*  This is not a handle [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=75.64s)]
*  This is where you have the conductivity depth and temperature sensor in here [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=77.08s)]
*  And this is a dissolve oxygen [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=81.36s)]
*  The unit can find the warmest sections of water which can intensify hurricanes [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  Normally we dive to 900 meters and it takes about four hours [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=88.12s)]
*  So it's about six dives per day [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  The drones collect data underwater and send it to computers like this using satellite radio waves [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  So one of the things we want to know is when the glider goes into the water if you look here [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=101.44s)]
*  This is the actual track of what the glider did and you see this is like almost a perfect V shape [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=106.52s)]
*  Which is what we strive for when the drones surface after each dive [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=111.88s)]
*  They transmit their location to Yuli's computer which shows up as those little dots between the lines [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  So here is a map of where our gliders are right now [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=121.8s)]
*  So we have gliders south of Puerto Rico these three that is right here [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=126.66s)]
*  one south of the Dominican Republic and one north of Puerto Rico [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=131.12s)]
*  While gliders take measurements underwater sail drones track what's happening on the ocean surface [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=135.92s)]
*  They want to get the sail drone to be at the same location as the glider [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=141.2s)]
*  This way you have information from the surface down and then also you know [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=145.52s)]
*  I'm a surrogate information because the sail drones have [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=150.0s)]
*  Capability of doing that built for extreme conditions the robots are [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=153.6s)]
*  23 feet long with a 15 foot wing that powers the drone and solar panels that power the sensors [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=157.28s)]
*  These sensors test surface level temperature wave height wind speed and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  Solinity or how fresh the water is and if they are fresh we know that they will remain in the surface [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=169.16s)]
*  And if that water is also warm it indicates a site that could intensify a hurricane [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  So one of Gustavo Goni's teams marks those areas on a map to keep an eye on and when a hurricane is coming [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=181.83999999999997s)]
*  The robots can sail straight into the storm [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=188.83999999999997s)]
*  But it's still under those conditions it has to conduct the observations and transmit them [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=191.92s)]
*  2022 was the first year that NOAA deployed gliders and sail drones to the same areas of the Atlantic and this season [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=199.36s)]
*  NOAA is adding super tough new aerial drones that can fly through the 200 mile per hour winds around the eye of a hurricane [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=206.52s)]
*  These drones provide us that information from the temperature the relative humidity the pressure [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=214.76s)]
*  Information wind wind speed and wind direction all of those factors are key on how we understand how the hurricane is is evolving [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=221.24s)]
*  That data goes into the computer models so that we can better forecast what's going to happen the next day and so on [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=229.28s)]
*  Shirley Murillo is in charge of the hurricane research department at the lab [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=235.76s)]
*  For years hurricane hunter planes have flown above hurricanes to take measurements [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=240.24s)]
*  Oh [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=245.95999999999998s)]
*  Today aerial drones are launched from those planes flying into the eye of the storm giving experts a wealth of new data about how these [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=248.92s)]
*  monster storms intensify [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=256.96s)]
*  Hurricane intensity is a tough nut to crack there are so many different pieces of the puzzle that need to be solved [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=259.24s)]
*  From looking at the different layers of the atmosphere from vertically to horizontally to two different timescales [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=265.68s)]
*  From the air scientists at these stations pilot the drones gliding them like hawks into gale force winds [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=273.68s)]
*  sometimes closer than 100 feet from the ocean surface [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=280.84s)]
*  Last year NOAA flew this drone the Altia 600 into the eye of a category 4 hurricane for over two hours [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=285.08s)]
*  But the drone crashed and wasn't recovered [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=293.2s)]
*  We experiment with aerial drones to see which one is going to give us the best information [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  At the best time while we're flying in the storm [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  And so it's you know, it's a trial and error for the 2023 season [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=305.2s)]
*  NOAA is also using black swift s0 and dragoon drones with a new probe that can measure vertical winds [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=309.4s)]
*  Allowing researchers to predict how long a storm will last at its highest intensity as NOAA [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=316.52s)]
*  Scientists continue to chart the seas in anticipation of hurricanes. They see the information provided by drones as vital [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=323.0s)]
*  These data sets whether it's in the ocean [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=330.8s)]
*  Under the water or even in the air there are key piece for us to understand and forecast those those storms [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1asjOoQGm0c&t=333.72s)]
