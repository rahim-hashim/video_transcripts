# What’s Inside Zyn Nicotine Pouches? We Tested Six Flavors.  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c)
*  These white pouches may be the future of the tobacco industry, but there's no tobacco inside. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=0.0s)]
*  The main ingredient inside Zins is pure nicotine. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=8.4s)]
*  These are Zin nicotine pouches. The oral nicotine product comes in these cans. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=12.88s)]
*  You may have seen them for sale in convenience stores, gas stations, and even your local pharmacy. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=18.16s)]
*  Or on social media, where they've birthed a devoted subculture. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=23.76s)]
*  Good morning, boys. Popping a little. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=27.52s)]
*  Over the past year, sales of Zin have skyrocketed. In the fourth quarter of 2023, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=30.56s)]
*  116 million cans were sold in the U.S., a 78% increase over the same period a year earlier. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=36.0s)]
*  Zin is definitely having a moment. Pouch packed with problems. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=43.04s)]
*  But Zin's remarkable success has provoked a backlash and thrust it into the culture war. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=47.44s)]
*  Many people see it as a threat. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=52.72s)]
*  So, what can we learn about Zin when we test it in a lab? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  And how transformative a product could Zin be for the tobacco industry? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=58.959999999999994s)]
*  Today we're going to be finding out what's in Zins. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=67.84s)]
*  Ben Katz is an analytical chemist at UC Irvine specializing in mass spectrometry. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=70.32s)]
*  Outside of his university work, Katz has been testing nicotine pouch products. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=76.08s)]
*  What's in the pouch? Spearman edition. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=80.4s)]
*  And sharing the findings on his TikTok channel, MassSpecEverything. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=83.04s)]
*  Now we're going to test a chill, the wintergreen. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=87.04s)]
*  Today, Katz is testing six different Zin flavors. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=89.84s)]
*  All right, so now we're going to be analyzing the samples on the mass spectrometer. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=96.4s)]
*  A mass spectrometer is capable of weighing the exact mass of a molecule so that you can determine [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=101.76s)]
*  the composition of the chemical structure and identify what is in a sample. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=109.28s)]
*  Oh, it works. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=114.48s)]
*  In the data analysis software, we see a series of peaks. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=116.56s)]
*  There is a common peak that's in all of the samples, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=120.8s)]
*  and it's the most abundant peak in all the samples. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=124.0s)]
*  That is our nicotine peak. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  Based on these tests, nicotine is the bioactive molecule in Zin. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=128.0s)]
*  And the nicotine is the only tobacco-related alkaloid that we can see in this product. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=133.2s)]
*  Zin looks like a little tea bag. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=139.83999999999997s)]
*  It's a tiny little white pouch that tucks inside the cheek, and inside there's no tobacco leaf. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=142.72s)]
*  There is cellulose or wood pulp, along with some artificial sweeteners and flavorings and nicotine. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  In January, Senator Chuck Schumer called for a federal crackdown on the pouches. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=156.56s)]
*  I'm delivering a warning to parents because these nicotine pouches seem to lock their [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=161.52s)]
*  sights on young kids, teenagers, and even lower, and then use the social media to hook them. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  This scrutiny has in turn triggered another chapter in America's culture war, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=172.72s)]
*  with some on the right declaring a Zin-surrection. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=177.12s)]
*  Senator Tom Tillis responded on X with a message that said, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=180.24s)]
*  come and take it, Chuck. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=184.08s)]
*  So we're going to make him a Zin birthday cake. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  Fueling Zin's rise are self-styled Zinfluencers who feature the nicotine [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=187.76s)]
*  pouches in their social media content. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=192.16s)]
*  Unlike cigarette brands, nicotine pouch brands are permitted to advertise on billboards and television. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=198.32s)]
*  And unlike e-cigarettes such as Juul, they are sold in fruity flavors. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=204.56s)]
*  There are lots of brands of pouches on the market, including Rogue, Velo, and Lucy. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  But it's Zin that has emerged as the Kleenex of nicotine pouches. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=214.24s)]
*  Zin is sold by Swedish Match, a Swedish smokeless tobacco company. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=218.32s)]
*  In 2022, tobacco giant Philip Morris International acquired Swedish Match in a $16 billion deal. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=222.88s)]
*  Just last year, Philip Morris shipped 385 million Zin cans in the US. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=229.76s)]
*  And this year, the company forecasts shipment volumes of about 520 million cans. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=235.04s)]
*  Zin now represents 24% of the smokeless category, which includes traditional smokeless tobacco [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=240.4s)]
*  such as Copenhagen, Grizzly, and Skoll. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=246.0s)]
*  Nicotine pouches are still in their early days in terms of their share of the overall tobacco market. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=249.12s)]
*  They still would have a long, long way to go to really take a bite out of cigarettes. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  Despite the brand's success, Zin's unofficial brand ambassadors have created a headache for Zin's owner, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=264.0s)]
*  The most famous Zin influencer is Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=270.47999999999996s)]
*  He is sort of a self-appointed and unofficial Zin brand spokesman. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  In October, Tucker Carlson made unfounded claims that Zin helps with focus and erectile dysfunction. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=282.0s)]
*  Zin is a powerful work enhancer and also a male enhancer, if you know what I mean. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=288.32s)]
*  Philip Morris has pushed back very hard on these claims and has actually [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=294.32s)]
*  sort of asked his team to cease and desist on that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=298.96s)]
*  Philip Morris said it has reached out to social media influencers, asking them not to promote Zin [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=301.92s)]
*  in any form, but the audience includes people under 21. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=306.8s)]
*  The company said its products are intended for adults who already use nicotine. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=310.08s)]
*  Senator Schumer's interest in Zin, I think, is related to his long-standing interest in [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=314.48s)]
*  tobacco control, especially risk to youth. However, the national data, survey data, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=320.96s)]
*  tells us that kids are not really using this product at significantly high levels, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=327.92s)]
*  so there's not really evidence for any kind of epidemic. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=333.2s)]
*  A 2023 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that around 1.5% [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  of middle school and high school students reported using nicotine pouches in the last 30 days. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  Some public health experts say nicotine pouches like Zin could save lives by helping adult [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=348.32s)]
*  cigarette smokers switch to a much safer alternative. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=353.52s)]
*  Would I consider, you know, recommending Zin to friends or family that smoked cigarettes? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=356.56s)]
*  Yes, I would. We know that smoking is bad, bad, bad for you. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=361.84s)]
*  Anecdotally, I've heard from e-cigarette users who have switched over to Zin. It's very, very [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=367.11999999999995s)]
*  hard to detect that someone has a nicotine pouch in their mouth. I've done interviews with folks [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=373.35999999999996s)]
*  who would talk to me for half an hour and I never noticed until at the end of the interview they [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=378.55999999999995s)]
*  would take the pouch out. According to the FDA, nicotine is addictive, but by itself, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=382.96s)]
*  it doesn't cause cancer or lung disease. We don't really, you know, 100% know what the long-term [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=388.32s)]
*  effects of nicotine use are. However, we do have some pretty good indications from evidence that [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  comes from other parts of the world. So, for example, the country of Sweden is famous for [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=403.36s)]
*  using a product called Swedish snus. Snus is a moist, pasteurized, smokeless, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=409.28s)]
*  oral tobacco product which is placed under the lip to deliver nicotine through the gums. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=415.44s)]
*  It's been used by consumers in Sweden since the 1970s. And this is a product that's in some way [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=420.40000000000003s)]
*  similar to Zin. It's actually the precursor to Zin and it's known to be much less toxic compared [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=426.08000000000004s)]
*  to other oral tobacco products. Since snus pouches were first introduced in Sweden in 1973, smoking [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=432.72s)]
*  rates have fallen considerably. Sweden now has the lowest smoking rate of all of the European Union [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=439.91999999999996s)]
*  countries. They also now have the lowest rates of smoking-related cancer. So that tells me that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=446.56s)]
*  people who use clean nicotine products are much less likely to develop serious diseases that we [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  know are related to smoking. So Schimmer asked the FDA to investigate and the FDA already has been [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  conducting a review of Zin because all nicotine pouch manufacturers were required to submit their [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=469.12s)]
*  products for FDA review in order to get authorization to keep them on the U.S. market. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=476.24s)]
*  If the agency does authorize a nicotine pouch, the authorization might come with marketing [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=481.68s)]
*  and flavor restrictions. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpLRiduF8c&t=487.03999999999996s)]
