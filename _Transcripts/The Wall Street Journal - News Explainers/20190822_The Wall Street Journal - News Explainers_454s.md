# How Radicalization Online Can (And Can't) Be Stopped | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 22, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ)
*  White supremism. It's like one of the rarest things in this country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  It's happened to Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Richard Spencer. The list goes on. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=3.44s)]
*  All of these individuals were deplatformed or kicked off of different web services [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=8.64s)]
*  after those services deemed comments they made hateful, a characterization they all deny. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=13.44s)]
*  We are experiencing what we see as a wave of deplatforming right now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=19.92s)]
*  Oftentimes when we talk about deplatforming, we talk about someone losing their account [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=25.32s)]
*  on social media. But deplatforming can exist in many different ways. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=29.6s)]
*  Deplatforming isn't just limited to individuals. The tactic is also being used to silence extremist websites. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=34.56s)]
*  Shortly before he allegedly murdered 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=41.52s)]
*  Patrick Cruz has shared his manifesto to an obscure web forum called 8chan. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=46.24s)]
*  Website 8chan. That's where the suspected gunman in Saturday's attack. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  Hosted a four-page anti-immigrant manifesto. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  This wasn't the first time that an alleged mass shooter had posted a manifesto to 8chan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=58.16s)]
*  The individuals who allegedly carried out the Christchurch mosque shootings [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  and the Poway synagogue shooting also posted their manifestos to 8chan. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=66.72s)]
*  But this time the response to the shooting was different. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=72.0s)]
*  Cloudflare, an internet infrastructure company, decided to deplatform or stop providing its [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=75.19999999999999s)]
*  services to 8chan, effectively shutting down the site, at least for now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=80.64s)]
*  There are about one million users of 8chan. 8chan is an empty piece of paper for writing on. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=85.52s)]
*  In response to the takedown, 8chan's owner, Jim Watkins, posted this video to YouTube. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=93.92s)]
*  It is clearly a political move to remove 8chan from Cloudflare. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=99.6s)]
*  It has forced a lot of people to find other places to talk. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=104.32s)]
*  Today, deplatforming is the most popular tactic to deal with extremist content online. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=108.64s)]
*  But does it actually work? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  It's not necessarily going to create a causal chain where we get rid of hate online. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=115.52s)]
*  But what it does do is it disrupts this community of people that have been building, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=121.36s)]
*  over the last five years, a culture of harm and harassment and incitement. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=126.08s)]
*  According to Professor Donovan, deplatforming might solve the problem of the use of online [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=132.4s)]
*  platforms. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=137.2s)]
*  Deplatforming might slow the growth and the impact of these websites, but it can't wipe [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=138.2s)]
*  their ideology away entirely. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  The individuals who carry out such attacks are not the lone wolves the media often portray [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=144.28s)]
*  them as, Donovan says, noting that their manifestos suggest they are part of a growing and global [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=148.14s)]
*  white supremacist movement. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=153.76s)]
*  When we say that they're lone wolves, what we're pointing to is that these are disaffected [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=156.48s)]
*  people who live in isolation and are coming out of nowhere to conduct this violence. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=160.6s)]
*  Instead, the research is actually pointing to that these people are never alone, that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=166.8s)]
*  they reach out online, they have a lot of questions. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=170.72s)]
*  Mostly they look into white supremacist theories of how political parties and media are colluding [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  to keep white people down. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=183.88000000000002s)]
*  It wasn't that long ago that Scott Ernest believed in that white nationalist narrative. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=187.32000000000002s)]
*  I got involved by accident. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=193.36s)]
*  It was 2004 and I was just searching the internet. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=197.36s)]
*  I'm not even sure what I was doing, just surfing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=202.96s)]
*  And I came across a blog. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  Like many young extremists, Ernest was radicalized online. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  Eventually it did become a community thing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  You get in there and you meet these people. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  And I mean, even if you don't necessarily like all of them, you know, you start feeling [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=218.52s)]
*  connected to them. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  He eventually became a moderator on Stormfront, a popular white nationalist website. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=225.0s)]
*  It's for all white nationalists. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=230.44s)]
*  So you could be a moderate, you could be extreme, you could be KKK, you could be NSM, National Socialist. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=231.6s)]
*  He says he began to distance himself from the movement as it became more violent. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=238.76s)]
*  You know, a lot of the movement actually believe in the mass shootings. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=242.52s)]
*  In an email to the Wall Street Journal, Stormfront's founder, Don Black, said, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=247.68s)]
*  We have always clearly stated that we do not tolerate any posts even suggesting illegal violence. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=252.08s)]
*  Any such posts are immediately deleted by moderators and the user band. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=257.24s)]
*  The first time I ever questioned why I was in the movement was when Anders Brevik shot [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  a bunch of kids in Norway. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=267.44s)]
*  That caught my eye because at some point previous to that, Anders Brevik had actually been on [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=269.52000000000004s)]
*  my Facebook friend list under the name of Andrew Berwick. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=274.68s)]
*  Brevik, who murdered 77 people in 2011, has since become an icon of sorts for white nationalists. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  On sites like 8chan, users have celebrated his kill count for years and done so legally. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=285.56s)]
*  That's because vile or not, the racist and violent speech often found on sites like 8chan [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=291.72s)]
*  is protected under the First Amendment. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=296.24s)]
*  There's much discussion about social media, its implications, the harms done. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=298.48s)]
*  And the question is posed, what should government do about social media? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=303.44s)]
*  Civil libertarians like John Samples are skeptical of any government reforms, arguing that regulation [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=309.4s)]
*  of speech will backfire and be abused. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=315.1s)]
*  We have very strong protections and that's going to mean that there's not much government can do. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=317.48s)]
*  But that hasn't damped calls for reform. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=323.72s)]
*  For her part, Professor Donovan would like to see legislation regulating the amplification [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=325.96s)]
*  of hate speech online. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=330.5s)]
*  Individuals who own websites are allowed to decide what stays and what goes. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=333.64s)]
*  That is non-controversial. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=339.28s)]
*  But when we run into the problem of scale, when that speech scales so that it is comparable [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=341.76s)]
*  to broadcast, when you have 50, 60,000 people that are looking at particular posts or videos [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=348.32s)]
*  online that contain racist speech, hate speech, harassment, incitement, then we have to come [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=357.04s)]
*  up with a schema related to amplification like we did with broadcast radio, like we've [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=364.92s)]
*  done with television, that sets a different set of rules. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  For decades now, radio and television stations have had to follow regulations meant to ensure [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=374.8s)]
*  they serve the public interest, based in part on their reach. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=379.88s)]
*  Although the internet is different, Donovan says it's clear our current laws have not [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=383.52s)]
*  kept up with our technological advancements and that perhaps we should consider a new framework. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=387.56s)]
*  You can say that any regulation around what someone says online is protected, but I think [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=393.12s)]
*  that's clearly not right today. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=398.35999999999996s)]
*  The third way forward is already in the works. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=400.0s)]
*  Zuckerberg announced that Facebook is creating an independent body that will review controversial content. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=402.35999999999996s)]
*  You know, it's not clear to me that we want a private company to be making that kind of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=408.08s)]
*  a fundamental decision about what is political speech and how should that be regulated. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=412.6s)]
*  In a blog post addressing the El Paso Shooters manifesto, the chief executive of the web [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=418.76000000000005s)]
*  services company Cloudflare wrote that 8chan's lawlessness had contributed to multiple horrific [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=423.32000000000005s)]
*  tragedies and as a result, Cloudflare would no longer be supporting the site. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=428.84000000000003s)]
*  But Cloudflare's post also highlighted how some web service companies are being thrust [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=433.96000000000004s)]
*  reluctantly into the role of policing speech. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=438.32000000000005s)]
*  Cloudflare wrote, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6984NNJyWQ&t=441.84s)]
