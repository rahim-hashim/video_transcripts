# Why Putin Is Suspending the Last U.S.-Russia Nuclear-Arms Treaty Left  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0)
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow would suspend its participation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=0.0s)]
*  in the last remaining major nuclear arms control treaty between the US and Russia, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=5.28s)]
*  the New START Treaty. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=10.44s)]
*  We want to be hit by a strategic defeat and then climb on our nuclear object. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Mr President, any reaction to Putin's any point out of his start? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=16.68s)]
*  I'm not going to make any. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=20.76s)]
*  I beg your stay. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=21.76s)]
*  Here's what the New START Treaty is [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=22.76s)]
*  and what Russia's suspension means for global nuclear arms control. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=25.16s)]
*  The New START, meaning New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=30.28s)]
*  was signed in Prague in 2010 by former President Barack Obama [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=34.52s)]
*  and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=39.4s)]
*  It was an extension to START I, which was signed in 1991. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=43.04s)]
*  This was a way to try to reset relations between Russia and the US after the Cold War. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=47.68s)]
*  The agreement was important because these two countries hold approximately 90% [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  of the world's nuclear weapons, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=58.8s)]
*  so the pact was created to make sure this arsenal was controlled. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  The treaty limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=66.52s)]
*  that can be deployed by either Russia or the US to 1,550 [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=70.12s)]
*  and allows both sides to inspect each other's nuclear facilities. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=76.16s)]
*  Vladimir Putin said it was time to suspend this deal [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=81.96s)]
*  because Russia feels the US has not abided by the agreement [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  by not allowing Russian inspectors on US nuclear sites. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=89.27999999999999s)]
*  The US said it is Russia that is blocking on-site inspections. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  NATO Secretary-General urged Vladimir Putin to reconsider the suspension. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  We have to remember that this is one of the last major arms control agreements we have. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=104.52s)]
*  The Foreign Ministry has said, following Mr Putin's announcement, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=109.96s)]
*  that Russia would continue to observe the limits on the number of nuclear warheads [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=114.12s)]
*  it can deploy under the treaty. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=119.04s)]
*  And it also said that Russia would continue to notify the US when it plans to test launch [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=121.44s)]
*  intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=126.84s)]
*  They don't leave the agreement. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=131.88s)]
*  No, they are stopping their participation. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  We'll be watching carefully to see what Russia actually does. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=136.96s)]
*  We'll of course make sure that in any event we are postured appropriately [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=140.88s)]
*  for the security of our own country and that of our allies. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  This suspension means that the US will lose access to inspect some of Russia's nuclear facilities. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=149.0s)]
*  And it's worrisome because what Russia is planning, whatever that is, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=155.12s)]
*  it could become more shrouded in secrecy. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=158.92s)]
*  But moreover, it calls into question whether or not this agreement to control nuclear weapons [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=161.68s)]
*  can actually last now. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=167.6s)]
*  China, for example, has indicated that it wants to build a large nuclear arsenal. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=171.28s)]
*  North Korea, as we know, has been testing intercontinental ballistic missiles. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=175.96s)]
*  And there's also concern among Western officials that Iran might actually be close to making [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=180.48s)]
*  bomb-grade nuclear fuel. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  The Journal spoke to the director of the pro-Kremlin Institute for Political Studies, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=189.68s)]
*  who said that if Washington doesn't listen to Moscow now, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=194.56s)]
*  Putin may officially withdraw from the treaty. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=197.8s)]
*  And if that happens, we could expect a change that would reduce the US's nuclear security. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISZYMyWA9L0&t=200.68s)]
