# How the Permian Basin Became North America's Hottest Oilfield  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 28, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc)
*  This is a map of known sediment basins in the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=0.0s)]
*  Many of these regions hold deposits of natural gas and crude oil. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=5.0s)]
*  Now, this map compares how much crude oil each basin holds. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=10.0s)]
*  Of the many formations scattered across the country, one reigns supreme. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=14.0s)]
*  With our new estimates of the Permian Basin, that resource estimate is on par with what has been estimated in the Middle East. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=20.0s)]
*  The first oil well was drilled in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico roughly a century ago. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=29.0s)]
*  And now, the basin produces more than 4 million barrels of crude oil on a daily basis. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=35.0s)]
*  Surging Permian production has helped make the U.S. the top oil producer in the world. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=41.0s)]
*  That growth hasn't come without challenges. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=47.0s)]
*  Let's unravel how this strip of desert propelled America's ascent to crude oil superpower. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=51.0s)]
*  The Permian Basin's first commercial operations began at Mitchell County in Big Lake, Texas. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=57.0s)]
*  The region's resources soon proved critical. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=64.0s)]
*  Data collected in the 20th century show wells in the Permian yielding 10 to 22% of national crude oil production. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=67.0s)]
*  That oil was key in moments of international conflict. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=75.0s)]
*  Crude was a key commodity in World War II. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=79.0s)]
*  Refined fuels stemming from the Gulf Coast powered engines and aided in the manufacture of everything from roads to uniforms and bombs. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=81.0s)]
*  And during the global oil crisis of 1973, oil from the Permian helped stabilize U.S. markets as OPEC nations cut supply in an embargo. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=89.0s)]
*  For years, there was steady growth in the region. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=100.0s)]
*  But following the 1970s energy crisis, oil prices dropped and drilling became far less profitable. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=102.0s)]
*  Production dwindled. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=109.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, new extraction methods developed incrementally. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=111.0s)]
*  Hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, was invented in the late 1940s, but decades would pass before it was used widely. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=115.0s)]
*  In the modern version of this process, producers drill through several layers of the Earth's crust. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=123.0s)]
*  Then they blast a mixture of water, sand, and chemicals through the rock at a high pressure. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=128.0s)]
*  This fractures the rock and unlocks oil from the crust. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=134.0s)]
*  For many years, producers used fracking to maximize production from conventional resources, large reservoirs of crude oil that were easy to draw to the surface. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=137.0s)]
*  But a breakthrough in the nearby Barnett Shale unlocked vast new reserves in shale rock formations. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=147.0s)]
*  In 1998, an engineer at Mitchell Energy used a dramatically higher ratio of water to chemicals and sand to blast through sediment. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=153.0s)]
*  The new method made it possible to extract resources that weren't previously commercially viable. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=161.0s)]
*  While fracking helped producers recover every drop possible, new drilling technologies expanded their reach, especially horizontal drilling. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=166.0s)]
*  It became common in the Permian in the 2000s. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=174.0s)]
*  The advent of horizontal drilling meant that producers could target multiple formations from a single site at the surface. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=177.0s)]
*  These wells can sometimes stretch for miles. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=184.0s)]
*  Fracking and horizontal drilling are particularly effective for the basin's geology. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=187.0s)]
*  The Permian's western subbasin, the Delaware, has more depth than other parts, according to the USGS. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=193.0s)]
*  Because they are so thick, industry is able to put in multiple wells within that stack of units and drill multiple horizons to produce oil. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=199.0s)]
*  And that is really what's unique about that area. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=210.0s)]
*  The Permian has significant deposits of shale rock, and the combination of fracking and horizontal drilling in the 2000s made the tight oil and shale recoverable. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=214.0s)]
*  This combination set the stage for the shale revolution, which picked up steam in the 2010s. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=223.0s)]
*  This put the basin at the center of a crude oil renaissance in America. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=229.0s)]
*  The national production rate, which had dwindled for decades, mounted a turnaround. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=233.0s)]
*  Since the mid-aughts, the national crude production rate has mostly climbed upward on the strength of the Permian, save for a short decline that began in 2015. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=239.0s)]
*  The year prior, US crude prices plunged 50%. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=248.0s)]
*  Many producers in the basin scaled back production to prevent further losses. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=252.0s)]
*  But the producers that survived were in position to drive the Permian to new heights. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=257.0s)]
*  Moving ahead to 2018, the United States surpassed Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the world's leading oil producer. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=262.0s)]
*  But this production brought new challenges. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=269.0s)]
*  First is the issue of well placement. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=273.0s)]
*  Here's an oil field outside of Odessa, Texas in 2003. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=276.0s)]
*  By 2018, these fields were brimming with well pads. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=279.0s)]
*  That can put a damper on production rates. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=283.0s)]
*  Producers in recent years have tried to space wells more closely together to maximize the amount of oil and gas that they're able to get out of their acreage. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=286.0s)]
*  They've found in some instances that that hurts the output of individual wells. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=299.0s)]
*  Producers are kind of going back and increasing the distance between the wells that they drill. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=306.0s)]
*  The result is that they have fewer overall locations to drill on the acreage that they have. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=313.0s)]
*  And the problems don't end there. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=321.0s)]
*  The pipelines that run through the Permian have had a capacity issue. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=323.0s)]
*  In recent years, oil production in the Permian has increased faster than pipeline capacity, leading to bottlenecks and discounted prices. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=327.0s)]
*  And when capacity isn't sufficient, producers are instead left to transport resources by rail or truck. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=334.0s)]
*  Or they have to slow down production. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=341.0s)]
*  New pipelines are scheduled to come online in late 2019, which could help alleviate price discounts. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=343.0s)]
*  But the energy producers in the Permian can't escape their fraught connection to the climate and environment. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=349.0s)]
*  Consider the issue of flaring. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=356.0s)]
*  The natural gas flowing from the Permian is mostly a byproduct. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=358.0s)]
*  When producers drill for oil, they also unearth natural gas, which is less profitable. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=362.0s)]
*  Facing limited profitability and pipeline capacity issues, many drillers choose to burn their fuel on site. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=367.0s)]
*  Flaring in the Permian is at all time highs, according to Ristad Energy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=374.0s)]
*  That's a concern, first of all, because it's a colossal waste of energy. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=378.0s)]
*  But more so, they can cause local air quality issues if they're not burning properly. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=382.0s)]
*  And we're releasing a bunch of greenhouse gas into the air as carbon dioxide that we're wasting. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=387.0s)]
*  So flaring benefits nobody. The only thing that it's better than is releasing the methane into the air directly. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=393.0s)]
*  The string of boom towns and man camps along the Permian Basin represent the heartbeat of American energy. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=400.0s)]
*  All eyes are on the region as the U.S. fights to maintain its position atop global oil markets. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfPZ8tlUnBc&t=406.0s)]
