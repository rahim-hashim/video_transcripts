# What China’s New Peacemaker Diplomacy Means for the U.S.  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA)
*  Chinese President Xi Jinping met with his Russian counterpart during a state visit to Moscow [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=0.0s)]
*  Dear friend, welcome to Russia and Moscow [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=6.0s)]
*  and is soon expected to talk to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the first time since the war started [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=9.0s)]
*  While the West has expressed concerns over China's deepening ties with Russia, Beijing has indicated an ambition to help bring about talks toward a ceasefire in Ukraine [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=15.0s)]
*  Xi Jinping, one of his main goals is to make China into a superpower [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=24.0s)]
*  and so part of that is being involved in security discussions and peace talks around the world [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=29.0s)]
*  Recent diplomatic breakthroughs brokered by China offered tangible evidence that Beijing is willing to use its influence to help resolve foreign disputes [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=36.0s)]
*  Austin Ramsey covers China's global reach for the journal and explains what Beijing's model of a new diplomacy means for the US [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=44.0s)]
*  On March 10th, Iran and Saudi Arabia announced that they agreed to reestablish diplomatic relations after seven years of estrangement in a deal mediated by China [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=51.0s)]
*  This is a sort of thing that would be difficult for the US to bring about [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=71.0s)]
*  The US doesn't have formal ties with Iran and is of course very critical of the Iranian authorities [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=75.0s)]
*  There was obviously a concern that the US had lost clout, particularly in the Middle East, and China was now playing this much more important role [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=83.0s)]
*  And this wasn't the first showcase of Xi's diplomatic ambitions [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=92.0s)]
*  Last June, China offered to quote, silence the guns across the troubled Horn of Africa at its first regional peace conference [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=97.0s)]
*  Delegates from six countries gathered in Ethiopia to hear China's pledge that Beijing was best placed to restore stability to the region [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=105.0s)]
*  The Chinese approach to these negotiations can be very different from the United States [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=113.0s)]
*  China has a policy of non-interference which often means not being critical of governments and just focusing on bringing them together [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=119.0s)]
*  That can be very appealing especially to governments that don't want their records examined [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=127.0s)]
*  While China has sought to contrast its regional policy with the US, Washington has accused Beijing of using the mediation dialogues to bolster authoritarian regimes and expand its security footprint [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=132.0s)]
*  An analyst says securing any diplomatic wins in Ukraine would be a much tougher challenge for Beijing [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=144.0s)]
*  European capitals and Washington have so far greeted Beijing's diplomatic push with skepticism [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=150.0s)]
*  China can't have it both ways when it comes to the Russian aggression in Ukraine [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=156.0s)]
*  It can't be putting forward peace proposals on the one hand while actually feeding the flames of the fire that Russia has started with the other hand [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=161.0s)]
*  Both Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin share a deep distrust of the US and the West [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=172.0s)]
*  And they see the world order as led by the West to the detriment of their own countries [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=178.0s)]
*  And so it's very harmful for China if Russia is damaged by the war and it no longer can play a role in supporting this effort to sort of lessen American and Western influence over the world [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=184.0s)]
*  As part of its push for what Xi calls big power diplomacy, Beijing increased its budget for diplomatic travel and other related expenses by 12% this year [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=197.0s)]
*  In a bid to counter China's inroads [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=208.0s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken travelled to Ethiopia and Niger in mid-March [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=211.0s)]
*  And he's just one of the many US officials who are visiting regions where Washington and Beijing are competing for influence [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=218.0s)]
*  I think nothing focuses the US like a competitor [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=224.0s)]
*  This could sort of bring about a sort of renewed American efforts to engage in diplomacy around the world, engage in diplomacy in some places that the US might have ignored a little bit in recent years [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id5XLeZmcUA&t=227.0s)]
