# How Taliban Expanded in Afghanistan During America's Longest War | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 02, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA)
*  May 1, 2003, the U.S. declares victory in Afghanistan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=0.0s)]
*  The bulk of this country today is permissive, it's secure. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=8.76s)]
*  The Taliban had been toppled only months after 9-11, and there were some 13,000 NATO troops [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  in the country. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=18.28s)]
*  Fast forward nearly 20 years. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=19.88s)]
*  American soldiers have left, the Taliban have come back, and the United Nations says civilian [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=21.8s)]
*  deaths of women and children in Afghanistan have hit record levels. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=26.6s)]
*  While it's difficult to map exactly how much territory the group actually controls, limited [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=30.840000000000003s)]
*  data suggests it's more than half of the country, with the insurgents claiming authority [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=35.52s)]
*  over major border crossings and infrastructure. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=39.94s)]
*  Many people both inside and outside the country have been surprised by the speed and the scale [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=42.6s)]
*  of the Taliban's advances and by how fragile the Afghan government's authority is looking. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=47.96s)]
*  It's time to end America's longest war. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=52.92s)]
*  It's time for American troops to come home. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=55.76s)]
*  Before Biden ordered America's troops to leave, the U.S. have been trying to exit for a while. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=58.32s)]
*  And by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=63.12s)]
*  The Taliban victories meant that U.S. soldiers remained in the country much longer than intended. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=68.24s)]
*  And now the foreign troops have gone and the Taliban is steadily taking over large parts [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=73.08s)]
*  of the country. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=77.12s)]
*  Here's how the insurgent group has expanded to become stronger than it's been in 20 years, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=78.12s)]
*  keeping the conditions for potential chaos as U.S. troops leave behind a country on the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=82.92s)]
*  brink of civil war. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=86.64s)]
*  At the beginning of the war, America's campaign in Afghanistan reached some milestones in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=89.72s)]
*  just a few months. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=93.6s)]
*  When the U.S.-led coalition invaded Afghanistan, the Taliban had controlled the country for [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=94.6s)]
*  five years after taking power following an extremely violent civil war. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=98.88s)]
*  They had imposed strict Islamic rule on Afghanistan. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=104.4s)]
*  All that changed after 9-11, when President Bush set out to punish the group for harboring [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=107.0s)]
*  al-Qaeda terrorists. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=111.64s)]
*  The United States military has begun strikes against al-Qaeda terrorist training camps [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=113.0s)]
*  and military installations of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=118.8s)]
*  Bush deployed some 2,500 U.S. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=122.84s)]
*  troops into the country, causing the Taliban to abandon Kabul and soon thereafter Kandahar, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  their main stronghold. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=130.6s)]
*  The Taliban were a broken force at that time. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=131.88s)]
*  They gave up barely without a fight and melded back into society and retreated into [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=134.6s)]
*  villages. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=139.84s)]
*  Some Taliban commanders actually offered to surrender in return for amnesty, but the U.S. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=140.88s)]
*  declined that offer and wanted to keep fighting them. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=145.8s)]
*  They wanted to stamp out every last terrorist from Afghanistan. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=149.52s)]
*  Instead, the Taliban regrouped in Pakistan, where they received shelter and support with [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=152.88s)]
*  the aim of returning later. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=157.52s)]
*  The Taliban began their resurgence, and by the middle of the decade, they had launched [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=160.44s)]
*  hundreds of suicide attacks and thousands of bombings, killing hundreds of U.S. soldiers. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=164.6s)]
*  So to counter their renewed presence, Obama began deploying more forces in the region. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=171.68s)]
*  The United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=176.52s)]
*  al-Qaeda. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=181.56s)]
*  May 1, 2011, Osama bin Laden, the man held responsible for the 9-11 attacks, was killed. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=182.56s)]
*  And around that period, the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan hit a peak of around [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=188.56s)]
*  100,000. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  The policymakers and experts began to question the effectiveness of that large military presence. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=193.92s)]
*  What became clear was that the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy did not eradicate the Taliban. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=201.88s)]
*  In fact, some of the more controversial tactics that the U.S. used in Afghanistan, such as [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=207.32s)]
*  night raids and arbitrary detentions and airstrikes that sometimes kill civilians, created discontent [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=211.27999999999997s)]
*  in local communities and actually helped the Taliban recruit more fighters. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=217.27999999999997s)]
*  The Taliban's recruitment drive enabled them to increase in numbers and gain control of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=222.24s)]
*  yet more territory, launching near-daily attacks against the U.S. and Afghan forces. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=226.24s)]
*  So with bin Laden dead and facing mounting pressure from Democratic lawmakers in Congress, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=231.74s)]
*  Obama announced his plan to withdraw some 33,000 troops from the region and transfer [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=236.32000000000002s)]
*  power to the Afghan military. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=240.72s)]
*  Our mission will change from combat to support. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  By 2014, this process of transition will be complete and the Afghan people will be [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=246.56s)]
*  responsible for their own security. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=252.56s)]
*  That plan didn't work as intended. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=254.9s)]
*  The Afghan security forces were plagued by problems that continued to haunt them, such [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=256.66s)]
*  as corruption, which made them an ineffective fighting force against the Taliban, who continued [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=260.76s)]
*  to fight allegedly armed and funded by Pakistan. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=265.6s)]
*  The Afghan government has acknowledged problems with effectiveness and corruption among its [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=269.16s)]
*  security forces, but told the Journal that corruption is decreasing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=272.96s)]
*  And Pakistan's government has denied backing the Taliban, but says it has some limited [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=277.28s)]
*  influence over the group. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  This map shows just how much territory the Taliban had taken over in 2017. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=283.68s)]
*  The Taliban's gradual advances across the country really began alarming people in the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=288.32s)]
*  capital. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=292.32s)]
*  After NATO announced the end of its combat mission, the Taliban scored symbolic victories [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=293.32s)]
*  such as capturing the city of Kunduz. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=298.44s)]
*  While mapping the Taliban's exact presence has been tricky in such a fluid situation, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=302.64s)]
*  some analysts have drawn maps based on news reports and social media that outline the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  group's territorial control from 2017. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=311.36s)]
*  At the time, the Afghan military was already struggling to hold the Taliban back, and Trump [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=314.4s)]
*  announced he was sending more troops. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  The security threats we face in Afghanistan and the broader region are immense. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=321.0s)]
*  President Trump's announcement fueled the will to fight among some fighters. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=327.34s)]
*  I remember speaking to young Taliban fighters who said that they'd actually considered [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=330.52s)]
*  giving up the war once the American troops left. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=334.64s)]
*  But once President Trump said he was going to send more troops, they said there was no [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  way they were going to give up the fight. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=341.0s)]
*  Around four years later, on July 4th, 2021, U.S. troops finally left Bagram, their main [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=343.12s)]
*  base of operations in the country. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=348.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Taliban's expansion accelerated. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=350.35999999999996s)]
*  We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=353.44s)]
*  As foreign troops pulled out, insurgents took many districts without having to fight. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=359.9s)]
*  The group has been trying to show a friendlier face, posting propaganda videos purporting [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=364.14s)]
*  to show Taliban fighters shaking hands with Afghan soldiers, or guarding borders without [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=368.41999999999996s)]
*  disrupting trade. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=373.06s)]
*  The Afghan government didn't respond to a request for comment on these images. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=379.26s)]
*  Analysts say it's part of a campaign to legitimize the insurgency amid negotiations with the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=383.41999999999996s)]
*  Afghan government. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=387.82s)]
*  While the Biden administration says America's military campaign has accomplished its objectives, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=390.54s)]
*  U.S. airstrikes against the Taliban are expected to continue, and America plans to keep monitoring [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=395.18s)]
*  terrorist threats. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=400.74s)]
*  People in Afghanistan question what the Taliban's plans are and whether they can coexist with [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=402.78s)]
*  the Afghan government. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=407.18s)]
*  The Taliban's gains raised two main risks for Afghanistan. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=408.42s)]
*  One that the country might split possibly along sectarian lines, which could throw the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=412.46s)]
*  country into another bloody civil war. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=416.54s)]
*  Or that a fundamentalist Islamist group takes power in Afghanistan again, which would undermine [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=418.54s)]
*  the whole purpose of the war, which was to eradicate terrorism risks from the country. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1DJHcju-oA&t=423.06s)]
