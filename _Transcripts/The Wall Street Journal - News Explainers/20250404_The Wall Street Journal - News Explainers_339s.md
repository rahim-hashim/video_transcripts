# How the Trump-Musk Alliance Sunk Tesla’s Market Cap Almost 50% | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc)
*  Fires, vandalism and protests, attacks on property carrying the Tesla logo, have been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=0.0s)]
*  surging across the globe. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=6.78s)]
*  Demonstrators gathering around the world. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=8.32s)]
*  A string of attacks targeting Tesla. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Promising to use domestic terrorism laws. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=12.06s)]
*  With Tesla's global vehicle deliveries falling 13% last quarter, questions are being asked [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  about the politicisation of the brand. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=20.02s)]
*  Elon Musk's forays into the political space and his close association with President Trump [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=22.76s)]
*  are driving some of this changed consumer behaviour and the changed public image of Tesla. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=27.479999999999997s)]
*  In the last year, Elon Musk has made a number of moves that have given a high political charge to his persona. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=36.16s)]
*  USA, USA. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=43.2s)]
*  He invested about a quarter of a billion dollars into the re-election effort behind President Trump. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=45.959999999999994s)]
*  During Donald Trump's one of his inaugural celebrations, he gave a salute that many interpreted [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=52.2s)]
*  to be a Nazi salute. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=57.0s)]
*  He started trying to have an influence in elections overseas, for instance backing the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=58.28s)]
*  far-right AFD party in Germany. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=63.56s)]
*  And he's become President Trump's budget cutter-in-chief and has not only led this [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=67.08s)]
*  effort to cut the federal budget and cut the bureaucracy, but has done it with an attitude. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=72.16s)]
*  The Tesla brand appears to have become a focal point for public anger. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=79.56s)]
*  In the European Union, new car registrations for Tesla fell 47% in February from a year earlier. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=84.11999999999999s)]
*  And in the US, sales fell by 2% in the first two months of this year. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=90.92s)]
*  Several factors are behind this. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  Beyond politics, there's more competition in the EV space. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=97.84s)]
*  Some consumers might be waiting for Tesla to refresh one of its models and come out [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  with an updated version. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  And because of Trump's tariffs, investors generally have been spooked in this country [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=107.64s)]
*  and markets have fallen, or at least been rocky, as a result. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=113.0s)]
*  However, the Trump administration believes these attacks are politically motivated. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=116.72s)]
*  Isn't it shocking how much violence and hatred is coming from the left? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  We've seen for a while now that political attitudes can affect consumer choices and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=128.28s)]
*  that companies that make a decision to back a certain political point of view or a cultural [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=134.04s)]
*  issue, whether it's Bud Light endorsing a transgender influencer. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=139.24s)]
*  This month I celebrated my day 365 of womanhood. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  Or Nike siding with the racial justice movement by giving an endorsement contract to Colin [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  Kaepernick that these things can win you support and show that a brand is in tune with the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=155.08s)]
*  political values of its customer base, but they also can engender pushback, which in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=160.88s)]
*  some cases can be damaging, as it was for Bud Light. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=166.2s)]
*  It dropped from being the top-selling brand of beer in America to third place after a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=172.28s)]
*  consumer boycott. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=177.0s)]
*  While experts believe the vandalism carried out across the US and Europe have, so far, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=179.04s)]
*  been the acts of a handful of lone actors, there are also organised protests. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=184.0s)]
*  Media group Planet Overprofit told the Journal that of all the brands Musk is associated [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=191.68s)]
*  with, including SpaceX and X, carmaker Tesla is the obvious choice to rally against. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=196.6s)]
*  They said Tesla is an accessible consumer product, with showrooms and charging stations [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=202.36s)]
*  everywhere, and that Musk has marked himself as the face of the brand, making it an easier [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=207.96s)]
*  target. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=213.32s)]
*  Tesla did not reply to the Journal's request for comment. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=214.32s)]
*  One of the twists here is that the more Elon Musk aligns himself with a conservative philosophy, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=217.68s)]
*  the more he kind of has a problem because it was the more liberal consumers who seemed [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=224.86s)]
*  to be open to electric vehicles, partly because of the environmental aura around them. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=229.32s)]
*  Conservative voters might be less likely to buy electric vehicles than liberal voters. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=235.38s)]
*  In the US, the Attorney General has described incidents of violence against Tesla as acts [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=240.12s)]
*  of domestic terrorism. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=245.0s)]
*  I think they're going to suffer very grave consequences because they're really terrorists [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=246.56s)]
*  when you think about it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=250.28s)]
*  They're very, they're terrorists at a high level. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=251.28s)]
*  While there is no catch all federal law to address domestic terrorism, prosecutors can [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=255.0s)]
*  pursue attackers for other offences, including arson, property destruction and gun charges. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=259.56s)]
*  Business leaders and politicians have long shared ties, but analysts believe that Musk [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=266.72s)]
*  has taken it to a whole new level. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=272.32s)]
*  Thank you, Elon. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=274.8s)]
*  You're working very hard. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=275.8s)]
*  One thing that Elon Musk and Donald Trump now have in common is that they're not both [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=277.36s)]
*  political figures. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=282.36s)]
*  They're both brands that you can buy. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=283.64000000000004s)]
*  You can decide whether to buy a Tesla or not. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=286.42s)]
*  And in doing so, you might be making a statement about whether you want to be aligned with [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  Elon Musk or not. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=293.76s)]
*  You could have voted for or against Donald Trump, but now you can also buy the Trump [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=295.20000000000005s)]
*  meme coins that he has put out for himself and for his wife, Melania, and any number [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=299.5s)]
*  of Trump products. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=304.58s)]
*  In some ways, the consumer purchases you make are a form of voting in many places in our [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=306.14s)]
*  consumer political culture. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=311.14s)]
*  Politics is everywhere. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=313.38s)]
*  And that's part of what's going on here with the story of Elon Musk and Tesla. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=314.7s)]
*  It's the most dramatic example, really, since Bud Light, of how political attitudes are [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=318.94s)]
*  informing consumer choices and how the product you buy is wrapped up in what you believe [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=324.82000000000005s)]
*  politically. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVEj9-MyhHc&t=331.34000000000003s)]
