# Inside Disney’s ‘Area 51,’ Where Lightsabers and Other Tech Are Invented  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY)
*  Playful droids. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=0.0s)]
*  Electromagnetic eyes. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=2.0s)]
*  And... [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=4.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=6.0s)]
*  That's real. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=8.0s)]
*  Pretty cool. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=10.0s)]
*  These inventions represent Disney's most experimental technologies. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=12.0s)]
*  Made here, at its research and development lab. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=15.0s)]
*  It's more like Area 51, and we've done a really good job of making sure that people don't understand what's happening inside of this building. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=18.0s)]
*  Inventors here build creations that are crucial to drawing guests to Disney's parks. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=25.0s)]
*  The centerpiece of the company's most profitable unit. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=30.0s)]
*  Disney is facing increasing competition from rivals like Universal. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=33.0s)]
*  And Lanny Smoot, the guy behind that lightsaber, is Disney's most decorated inventor. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=37.0s)]
*  If I see something that, in the real world, that is kind of quirky, maybe an illusion, I can build a whole attraction out of that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=44.0s)]
*  With Disney about to embark on a major expansion of its theme park business, and with competition in the industry intensifying. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=54.0s)]
*  So, any direction? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=61.0s)]
*  The company gave the journal a behind-the-scenes look at the tech that could make its next attraction. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=63.0s)]
*  This is my lab. I keep an inventory of the things that I need to do, prototypes that come about quickly. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=71.0s)]
*  Because an idea, I think, is fleeting. If you don't capture it and don't bring it out of your mind into the physical world, you can sometimes lose it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=80.0s)]
*  And I want to be fast. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=89.0s)]
*  Smoot is Disney's leader in patents. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=91.0s)]
*  He's named on more than 70 with the company, and more than 100 throughout his career. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=93.0s)]
*  This is the electromagnetic eye. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=98.0s)]
*  The idea for it is to replace a lot of the mechanisms that would be inside of a robotic head. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=101.0s)]
*  We call those the animatronics. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=106.0s)]
*  This, of course, is a much bigger version of it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=108.0s)]
*  There are magnets at the top, bottom, left and right of the inner eye. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=111.0s)]
*  And these coils create a magnetic field that move the eye left and right and up and down. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=115.0s)]
*  In his 25-plus years at Disney, he helped create those eyeballs, seen here in the chameleon Pascal. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=121.0s)]
*  The floating head of Madame Lyotard inside the haunted mansion. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=129.0s)]
*  Awake, the spirit! [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=133.0s)]
*  The water harps at Epcot. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=135.0s)]
*  And an x-ray flashlight used to teach fire safety with tech. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=137.0s)]
*  But that's not the focus. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=142.0s)]
*  Story is king here. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=144.0s)]
*  If you have technology, but it doesn't fit into a bigger picture, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=146.0s)]
*  which is the story of Star Wars or the story of one of our characters, it's of no use. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=151.0s)]
*  Some of those ideas take seemingly impossible things from the screen. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=156.0s)]
*  A computer-generated lightsaber, for instance. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=161.0s)]
*  And make them real. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=164.0s)]
*  Can someone get the lights? I'd like to show off my Jedi powers. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=166.0s)]
*  We have to make something that a guest can wield or that they can see on the stage, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=173.0s)]
*  and it has to look just like it does in the movies. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=179.0s)]
*  This is what Smoot calls the hero lightsaber, the most realistic one Disney has ever come up with. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=183.0s)]
*  It was used in performances at the company's immersive Star Wars hotel before it closed in 2023. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=189.0s)]
*  The key issue here was to have something that was both retractable, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=195.0s)]
*  but had the same diameter along its blade. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=199.0s)]
*  It's really hard to do. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=204.0s)]
*  According to the patent, a motor in the hilt activates two long plastic semi-cylinders, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=206.0s)]
*  which come together and extend, making the blade, which is then lit by a flexible strip of LEDs. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=211.0s)]
*  This is just one of the lightsabers that Smoot has worked on. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=218.0s)]
*  Another was used in displays. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=222.0s)]
*  So I have control of what we call the penumbra, the light that is sort of ephemeraly attached to the saber. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=224.0s)]
*  He's also helped develop technology for two more, one of which guests used in real life lightsaber training. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=233.0s)]
*  I have a sort of a cottage industry in lightsabers. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=240.0s)]
*  Each of those inventions is actually a completely technically different thing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=243.0s)]
*  The pressure is greater when a guest already is familiar with what this thing should be. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=248.0s)]
*  And the challenge is to deliver on that belief. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=255.0s)]
*  Getting the magic right is the kind of thing that can draw in new guests and turn them into repeat customers. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=259.0s)]
*  Which Disney needs. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=265.0s)]
*  Its rival Universal plans to open a major expansion to its Florida theme park in 2025, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=267.0s)]
*  something Disney hasn't done there since 2019. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=273.0s)]
*  And fans are clamoring for new experiences. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=276.0s)]
*  Walt Disney Imagineering is in service of making the parks attractive. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=279.0s)]
*  And if you can make something more fun, more amazing, more surprising, more people come, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=284.0s)]
*  and that's part of our business to make sure we have happy people and a lot of happy people in our parks. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=291.0s)]
*  One recent addition was these beady X-Droids for Star Wars Land. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=297.0s)]
*  But recreating the familiar isn't all Imagineering does. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=303.0s)]
*  Sometimes Smoot's job is creating things no one has seen before. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=308.0s)]
*  Like the holotile. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=313.0s)]
*  It's the world's first and only multi-directional, modular, multi-person holotile floor, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=315.0s)]
*  which is sort of an omnidirectional treadmill for multiple people. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=324.0s)]
*  Here's how it works. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=329.0s)]
*  The floor is made up of tiles of small articulating disks that spin and tilt to undo walking or push items in any direction. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=331.0s)]
*  In order for the floor to know where I am walking and to counteract my motion, we use LIDAR. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=341.0s)]
*  Beams of light or circles of light are emitted from these devices, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=348.0s)]
*  and the reflected time of flight of light lets them know where my feet are on the floor. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=354.0s)]
*  And knowing where my feet are and the strides I'm taking, we can use software to control the floor to undo my forward motion or my sideways motion. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=362.0s)]
*  Smoot says holotile is one of his longest projects. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=373.0s)]
*  He started on it almost seven years ago. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=376.0s)]
*  I was inspired. I'm going to go a little off brand, off the Disney brand to Star Trek, where they have a thing called a holodeck. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=379.0s)]
*  And that allows people to walk around in a place that is physically small, but they can walk forever as anywhere they want. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=388.0s)]
*  This woodland pattern is quite popular, sir. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=397.0s)]
*  Disney hasn't announced plans for holotile yet, but in the future, it could allow guests to harness the force. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=400.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=407.0s)]
*  Or make them feel like they are physically moving through space while using VR. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=408.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. Okay. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=413.0s)]
*  The work that Lanny Smoot has done on the holotile is an incredible contribution to both how we could potentially design new attractions in virtual reality, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=415.0s)]
*  in mixed reality in order to leverage that investment that we've made. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=424.0s)]
*  Smoot's inventions at Disney have even been awarded outside of the company. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=428.0s)]
*  Tonight we have the privilege of celebrating Lanny, whose work has taken us to places we could only imagine. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=434.0s)]
*  In May, he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=441.0s)]
*  I must have been doing something right during my years at Disney. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=446.0s)]
*  Making him the second person from Disney to receive the honor. The first, Walt himself. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=449.0s)]
*  It's a wonderful honor, but it is also a responsibility to carry on the bringing of new people, many people who look like me, into the fields of science and engineering. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=455.0s)]
*  When I was a kid, I didn't see black engineers almost till the time I was one. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=470.0s)]
*  I grew up in Brownsville, Brooklyn. It's not a wealthy area, I'll say that. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=475.0s)]
*  And being able to be a role model for folks again that may not have believed that you could go into a field, it's wonderful. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=480.0s)]
*  But Smoot's induction doesn't mark an ending. He's still tinkering. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=490.0s)]
*  So as I talk and my voice is louder or lower, I am making my little friend that's just a still image in eight places talk. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=495.0s)]
*  I'm proud of the things that I've been able to do over my career that on the technical side are good technically and used. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=506.0s)]
*  And on the fun side at the Walt Disney Company are technical and are used. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=514.0s)]
*  So it's been a good, good time and I want to keep going. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9miiL-nb1bY&t=519.0s)]
