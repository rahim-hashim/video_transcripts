# How the Trump-Musk Feud Risks Billions for SpaceX and NASA | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI)
*  Amid the fallout between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=3.52s)]
*  Musk threatened to decommission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=6.72s)]
*  That's a big deal for U.S. space missions. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=10.72s)]
*  Dragon has been the only U.S. spacecraft launched by a U.S.-based company transporting [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=13.6s)]
*  astronauts to and from the station from the U.S. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  I find this to be disconcerting how quickly this went to the threatening [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=23.36s)]
*  from contracts that's not good for the United States. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  Musk retracted the threat just hours later. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=33.2s)]
*  Still, as the feud continues, SpaceX remains one of the largest financial [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=36.16s)]
*  and logistical vulnerabilities for both Musk and Trump. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=40.8s)]
*  Since 2008, the government has awarded SpaceX more than 20 billion in contracts [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=45.68s)]
*  across at least 10 different agencies. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Most of it is focused here. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  NASA needs SpaceX. SpaceX needs NASA. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=55.6s)]
*  Musk said recently that SpaceX is expected to generate $1.1 billion in revenue this year [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=58.4s)]
*  from NASA. The company is less dependent on government contracts than it was in the past, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=64.0s)]
*  but still does big business with agencies. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=68.88s)]
*  SpaceX has really deep relationships with a lot of government agencies. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  Unraveling that would not be easy for either side. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=77.44s)]
*  NASA made a push during the Obama administration to contract with commercial companies. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=81.28s)]
*  We want to leap into the future. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  We had one launch provider, United Launch Alliance. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=87.36s)]
*  They were the result of a merger of Lockheed and Boeing. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=89.92s)]
*  When they consolidated, the costs went up and the U.S. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=93.2s)]
*  lost market share to the rest of the world, namely China, France, and Russia. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=97.92s)]
*  We set up competitions and SpaceX has been by far the leader in these major competitions. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=103.52s)]
*  Elon brought the cost of his Dragon down to under a billion and then under hundreds of millions. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=112.32s)]
*  I mean, just the savings are wonderful from a customer perspective because I can now [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=118.16s)]
*  purchase services rather than have to do them all in-house myself. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=122.96s)]
*  Since then, NASA has obligated more than $15 billion in awards to SpaceX, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=126.63999999999999s)]
*  including $2.9 billion to develop a human landing system as part of the Artemis program. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=131.92s)]
*  In 2022, NASA said the contract for ferrying astronauts to and from the ISS would total $4.9 billion. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=137.12s)]
*  Beyond sort of the dollars and cents, as we've been talking about with these astronaut missions, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  it's SpaceX that has been allowing NASA to do some of its highest profile operations. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=149.44s)]
*  When NASA says it's safe to fly on a SpaceX rocket, the world will follow. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=156.32s)]
*  The government's industries, anyone will say if it's good enough for NASA, it's good enough for us. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=162.08s)]
*  SpaceX recently had to step in with another NASA contractor. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=168.24s)]
*  Boeing was unable to bring back two astronauts from the ISS. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  The fact that SpaceX was tapped by NASA last summer to bring those two astronauts back to Earth, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=175.68s)]
*  NASA did not want Boeing to sort of finish that job, shows how comfortable NASA is or has gotten [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=181.44s)]
*  over the years with using SpaceX and the trust that the agency has that the vehicle and the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=188.08s)]
*  operational side of it works and can be safe. It also very much did highlight the dependence NASA [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=193.52s)]
*  has on SpaceX for this particular operation. Between Starlink flights and missions for [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=200.24s)]
*  outside customers, SpaceX carried out nearly double the amount of launches than the next [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  three most active companies combined. That is like a huge ongoing business and something that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=211.52s)]
*  SpaceX is expected to be doing for years to come. Agencies also contract SpaceX for its own [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=217.44s)]
*  satellites. Its growing and strategically important Starlink system. You see sort of Starlink popping [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=223.84s)]
*  up in everything from military bases or government agencies needing some kind of satellite internet [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=229.52s)]
*  solution. One of the most notable contracts is one to provide Starlink to Ukraine. A lot of military [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=236.8s)]
*  officials who are thinking about the future of war have been obsessed and really interested in [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=243.12s)]
*  how the Ukrainians have used Starlink. That experience in that conflict zone has created [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=248.16s)]
*  just a lot of awareness at the Pentagon and frankly in governments around the world about the need for [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=254.48s)]
*  fast, reliable, secure communications in conflict areas. Starlink is also a big revenue generator [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=259.52s)]
*  for SpaceX outside of the government. Quilty Space, a consulting firm, estimated that Starlink [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=266.8s)]
*  revenue is set to grow to $12.3 billion this year. Starlink has provided a very significant [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=272.96s)]
*  revenue source for SpaceX that isn't dependent on government contracts and the budget cycles in [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=279.52s)]
*  Washington and all the rest. SpaceX has a number of important future projects with the U.S. government [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=285.84s)]
*  lined up. SpaceX, because they've been successful, have been built into the ecosystem and the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=293.76s)]
*  architectures of future missions for both NASA and also the Department of Defense and other [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=299.6s)]
*  spacefaring agencies. So a lot of the U.S. government is dependent upon SpaceX for their very good [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=304.48s)]
*  vehicles. It's not just responsible for shuttling people and supplies to the ISS. It was also [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=310.88s)]
*  selected to de-orbit the station at the end of its operational life in 2030. And in April 2025, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=316.56s)]
*  the company was awarded almost $6 billion from the Department of Defense for future satellite [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=322.8s)]
*  launches. SpaceX also submitted a proposal for Trump's Golden Dome, a missile defense shield that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=327.76s)]
*  combines ground-based interceptors with satellites. A lot of people I've talked to believe that SpaceX [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=333.92s)]
*  will have to be involved one way or the other in that because it has the most launch capacity. And [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=338.96s)]
*  of course, it's also developing a huge new vehicle that could potentially be involved in the future. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=345.12s)]
*  So with all of this, what does it mean for SpaceX and NASA in Musk and Trump's potential divorce? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  Getting more competition is probably the biggest answer. Elon himself says he wants competition. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=355.68s)]
*  Unfortunately, SpaceX is so far ahead in so many areas that will take years. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  NASA experts think that a full breakup is unlikely. SpaceX, Elon, have every incentive to [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=368.48s)]
*  do this work. It all supports what his long-term vision is as stated to colonize [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=374.56s)]
*  Mars and make life interplanetary, make humanity interplanetary. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=382.32s)]
*  Ideally, we can take anyone who wants to go to Mars. We can take to Mars. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=386.96s)]
*  A NASA spokesperson said in a statement that NASA will continue to execute upon the president's [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=391.28s)]
*  vision for the future of space and that they will continue to work with industry partners [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=396.08s)]
*  to ensure the president's objectives in space are met. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxokG-MjgI&t=400.71999999999997s)]
