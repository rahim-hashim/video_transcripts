# How NASA Satellites Can Help Predict Volcanic Eruptions and Limit Damage | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 06, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ)
*  Volcanic eruptions like this may look mesmerizing, and sometimes attract flocks of tourists. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  But there are also dangerous events that impact human activities, displace people, and cost [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=8.0s)]
*  lives. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=12.36s)]
*  The prediction is that we will lose some 50% of our GDP as a result of the volcanic eruption. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=13.36s)]
*  Take this volcano on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=20.14s)]
*  No deaths were reported, but many people had to evacuate and ash-blanketed entire neighborhoods. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=22.84s)]
*  For this Icelandic volcano that erupted in 2010, paralyzing air traffic and costing nearly [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=27.9s)]
*  $5 billion to global GDP. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=32.699999999999996s)]
*  So far, tools like seismicity monitors have allowed volcanologists to forecast unrest [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=35.739999999999995s)]
*  days or weeks in advance. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=40.1s)]
*  But now, NASA scientists say they can help forecast eruptions months or even years ahead [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  of time, using satellite imagery and monitoring changes in ground temperature. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=46.7s)]
*  We wanted to understand to what extent the heat released by volcanoes can be used to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=50.86s)]
*  detect when volcanoes start to reactivate. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=56.08s)]
*  There are many impacts of volcanic eruptions. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  Our goal is to minimize those impacts as much as possible. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=62.6s)]
*  So here's how it works, and how scientists say we could benefit from this new research. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=66.12s)]
*  An early sign of a volcanic eruption is heat, as magma underground rises, bringing warm [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  gases to the surface. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  We see that these heat emissions start to appear for several months to years before [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=78.72s)]
*  We observe these signals prior to the changes that we observe with other types of signals. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=85.24s)]
*  The problem is that these heat emissions can be hard to monitor on the ground, so Girona [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=90.72s)]
*  and his team turned to the sky. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  NASA satellites have already been recording years of information on thermal activity. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=97.44s)]
*  In fact, none of these satellites have been designed specifically to explore volcanoes. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=101.72s)]
*  We can still use that information for monitoring volcanic eruptions. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  After looking at two decades of radiant heat data for several volcanoes, the researchers [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=111.56s)]
*  found a pattern. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=115.76s)]
*  In the years leading up to an eruption, temperatures increased over much of each volcano, before [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=117.22s)]
*  dropping again after the eruption. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=121.92s)]
*  We are detecting the early reactivation of the volcano, which is crucial to improve the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  monitoring efforts. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=129.6s)]
*  But before this technology can be fully deployed in the real world, scientists will have to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=132.56s)]
*  process much more data. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=136.7s)]
*  Hopefully in a few years we can have a better understanding of these signals, better understanding [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=138.6s)]
*  of volcanoes, and we can provide accurate forecasts. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=142.28s)]
*  With about 1,500 active volcanoes on Earth and troves of satellite data for each one [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=147.44s)]
*  of them, the NASA team is seeking help from algorithms and other researchers around the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=152.68s)]
*  world. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  This is another tool in our toolbox. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=158.24s)]
*  That's Mike Poland. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  He's a geophysicist for the US Geological Survey. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  He says that these satellite images will have to be used in tandem with other traditional [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  methods. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=168.92s)]
*  If you're building a house, you don't just show up with a screwdriver. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=169.92s)]
*  You've got a screwdriver, a hammer, a saw. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  We need a diverse toolkit so that we can recognize all the different types of signs that volcanoes [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=175.48s)]
*  might be giving us. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  Seismometers, gas sensors and radar sensors are some of the tools that volcanologists [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=182.68s)]
*  will continue to use. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=187.48s)]
*  Giving communities more time to prepare could make the difference between saving livelihoods [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=189.88s)]
*  or not. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=193.72s)]
*  In St. Vincent, the local observatory noticed signs of unrest weeks in advance, and officials [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=196.84s)]
*  were ready to evacuate 20,000 residents before the volcano erupted, helping to avoid casualties [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=201.68s)]
*  and greater damage. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=207.06s)]
*  But with even more warning, officials say they may have been able to avoid damage such [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=208.44s)]
*  as water contamination, for example. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=212.32s)]
*  When the massive eruption that took place, it compromised our entire water supply. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=214.76s)]
*  All of our reservoirs were contaminated with ash. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=219.48s)]
*  We were without water for a couple of days. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=222.72s)]
*  And perhaps going forward we can look at putting in tanks where persons can store water properly. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=224.76s)]
*  We have to look at greater mitigation where natural disasters are concerned. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=232.64s)]
*  And in the case of that Icelandic volcano, scientists say that more warning would have [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  given the aviation industry more time to adapt and find alternative routes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=241.96s)]
*  It's important to forecast eruptions because we can reduce the impact at a local scale, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=246.28s)]
*  but also at a global scale if we are talking about much larger eruptions. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8-FxCqyKQ&t=251.44s)]
