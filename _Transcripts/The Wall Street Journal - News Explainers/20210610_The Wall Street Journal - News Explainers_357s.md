# Elon Musk’s Power Over Crypto, Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 10, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs)
*  So you woke up this morning, you checked your crypto portfolio and what happened to my crypto? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=0.0s)]
*  Lately, cryptocurrency prices have been going on a wild ride and a lot of it has to do with Elon Musk. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=4.4s)]
*  Look, I know I sometimes say or post strange things, but that's just how my brain works. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=11.44s)]
*  The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has a lot to say about cryptocurrencies, often on Twitter. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=15.36s)]
*  Surprise, you just got Elon'd. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=20.32s)]
*  While Musk is not the only thing impacting crypto prices, one thing is clear. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=22.56s)]
*  When he tweets about cryptocurrencies, it can move markets and that power is unparalleled. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=27.12s)]
*  Here's how Musk has amassed such influence over cryptocurrencies and why some experts are raising alarms. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=32.4s)]
*  To understand just how influential Musk can be, take a look here. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=40.24s)]
*  On May 12th, Bitcoin was continuing on a steady downward trend, running off of an all time high the month before. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=44.64s)]
*  At 5 o'clock p.m., the cryptocurrency was hovering around $55,000. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=51.68s)]
*  And then at 6 o'6 p.m., this happened. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=57.12s)]
*  Musk tweeted that his electric vehicle company, Tesla, would no longer accept Bitcoin as payment due to concern over rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=60.56s)]
*  After the tweet went out, the price of Bitcoin plunged more than 5 percent, losing around $150 billion by the end of the day. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=72.68s)]
*  After that, you did have a lot of people who were really upset with Elon Musk. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=80.52s)]
*  Caitlin Ostroff, who has been following Musk's influence on the crypto market for The Wall Street Journal, says that there's been speculation that a lot of the selling after Elon's tweet was because retail traders weren't used to the high volatility. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=83.92s)]
*  People have to understand that this thing, this is a dice roll. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=96.0s)]
*  They suddenly got nervous that they were going to lose profits and sold. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=99.84s)]
*  They were replying to him on Twitter and they were saying, you know, you just cost me X thousands of dollars because all of a sudden my investment portfolio was worth $5,000. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  And now it's worth maybe four. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  But it hasn't just been Bitcoin. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=115.4s)]
*  Musk has tweeted about other cryptocurrencies as well. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=117.48s)]
*  Take the once joke crypto Dogecoin. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=120.64s)]
*  It keeps climbing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  The meme inspired cryptocurrency nearly doubling over the past week alone. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=124.92s)]
*  This ahead of Elon Musk's appearance on SNL. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=129.36s)]
*  Early on May 8th, before Musk was slated to host an episode of Saturday Night Live, Dogecoin was trading around 73 cents. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=132.2s)]
*  Investors had been pumping money into the cryptocurrency based on speculation that it could finally reach a dollar. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  But that didn't happen. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=146.76s)]
*  During a stidhi performed in the guise of a financial expert, the self-proclaimed Dogefather jokingly explained what Dogecoin is. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=148.67999999999998s)]
*  It's a cryptocurrency you can trade for conventional money. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  Oh, so it's a hustle. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=160.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's a hustle. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  By the time the episode ended, the price of the crypto had plummeted around 30 percent. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=164.2s)]
*  That comment alone rattled the confidence that people had that Dogecoin could keep pushing higher and people took profits and all of a sudden it sold off. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=169.08s)]
*  But then two weeks later, Musk tweeted a picture of a Shiba Inu on a dollar with the question, how much is that Doge in the window? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=177.6s)]
*  Following his tweet, the price spiked. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=185.36s)]
*  Dogecoin, unlike Bitcoin, doesn't really have an investment case. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=187.8s)]
*  And that means that Dogecoin is really just a cryptocurrency built on memes. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=192.16s)]
*  The only reason it has any value at all at the moment is because Elon Musk first started caring about it and then Snoop Dogg started caring about it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=196.8s)]
*  And then all of these other, like, rappers and celebrities started tweeting about Dogecoin. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=205.32000000000002s)]
*  While these are two of the most recent examples of Musk influencing crypto, there are many more. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=210.0s)]
*  And there are other forces at play that have allowed Musk to amass the influence he has on crypto. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=215.28s)]
*  Over the last year, there has been a flood of new retail investors, largely driven by the rise in no-fee [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  trading apps like Robinhood. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=226.48s)]
*  Meltem Demir, an executive at the asset management firm CoinShares, says that no-fee trading apps have increased the popularity of crypto because people can access more types of assets on the same platform. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  It's also made really illiquid cryptocurrencies of the past much more liquid because there's now much more retail participation. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=240.64s)]
*  Some experts say younger people gravitate towards Musk because they like his idea of the future and see him as rebellious. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=248.12s)]
*  And Demir says that Musk's huge Twitter following is a big part of his influence. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  He has over 56 million followers. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=259.04s)]
*  Financial markets, to some people, are a form of entertainment. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=261.48s)]
*  And so I think what we are seeing is the gamification of clout on social media, where people are recognizing that they can manipulate markets using social media as a tool. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=265.76s)]
*  But she says Musk's influence on the crypto market has downsides. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=276.48s)]
*  There is a wide range of ways through which market participants are acting on their desire to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=280.24s)]
*  And as a result, we see is more liquidity, but also more volatility when people like Elon Musk are tweeting directly to retail. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=287.64s)]
*  All assets are subject to ups and downs. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=296.79999999999995s)]
*  But as you can see from the big swings on this chart, crypto is especially volatile. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  All of a sudden, Elon has reminded people, no, this isn't just going up in a straight line. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=303.79999999999995s)]
*  It does come down and when it does, it can be fast. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=308.20000000000005s)]
*  These market swings can have a very real impact on retail investors. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=311.20000000000005s)]
*  But for some, the risk is worth it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=315.12s)]
*  Because there's no fundamentals, it makes it really hard to try and figure out where the floor is, like where the fair value and where the sell-off should stop when it happens. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=317.32000000000005s)]
*  And so you inherently wind up having a much more volatile market, which is what appeals to some investors for this. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=326.56s)]
*  Like they don't want the steady returns of the S&P where they have to wait, you know, 30 years to get where they want to be. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=333.36s)]
*  They want to get these fast, sharp returns. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=340.12s)]
*  Some experts think that Musk's influence on Bitcoin may be waning. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=343.32s)]
*  But for now, his tweets continue to send shockwaves through the crypto market. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kp0mtpHpIs&t=347.16s)]
