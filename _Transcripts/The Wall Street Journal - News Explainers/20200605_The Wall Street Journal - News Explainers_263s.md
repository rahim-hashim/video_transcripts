# A Professional Voice Actor's Tips for Sounding Good on Calls | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 05, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA)
*  In a world of quarantine, where no one is allowed outside, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=0.0s)]
*  and the only way to connect online is through the internet. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=5.0s)]
*  This is John Bailey, a professional voiceover artist. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=9.5s)]
*  You may also know him as... [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=13.0s)]
*  My name is Optimus Prime. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=14.5s)]
*  Autobots, transform and roll out! [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=17.0s)]
*  And I fill in quite a few times for Mr. Ryan Reynolds, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=20.0s)]
*  depending on what he's in the mood for, you know, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=23.0s)]
*  what color pants he's wearing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=25.0s)]
*  I've also filled in for Chris Hemsworth quite a few times. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=27.0s)]
*  And most recently Leonardo DiCaprio [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=30.0s)]
*  in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=33.0s)]
*  But really, he has actually subbed in for them, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=35.0s)]
*  in trailers and movies. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=37.0s)]
*  Clearly, we're not all voiceover artists with fancy setups, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=38.5s)]
*  but we are trying to sound our best, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=42.0s)]
*  whether it's on a phone call or a Zoom call. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=44.0s)]
*  Even John here doesn't sound perfect over Zoom, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=47.0s)]
*  without his fancy whisper room sound booth. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=49.5s)]
*  How's it going? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=52.0s)]
*  It's pretty good. Stuck inside like everybody else. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=53.5s)]
*  Nice. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=56.0s)]
*  You want me to call back from my booth [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=57.0s)]
*  so I can get better audio? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=59.5s)]
*  So I asked John to share the best ways [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=62.0s)]
*  we can sound better from home. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=64.0s)]
*  He had three big tips. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=65.5s)]
*  Hi, does that sound better? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=67.0s)]
*  Number one, your environment. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=68.5s)]
*  You don't want the sound to bounce around. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=70.5s)]
*  Like, the environment you're in right now, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=72.5s)]
*  you're hearing a lot of this room echo. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=74.5s)]
*  Hello, hello! Echo, do you hear me? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=76.0s)]
*  Where in my booth you don't hear that anymore, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=80.0s)]
*  because the sound absorbs into it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=82.0s)]
*  John's best advice? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=84.0s)]
*  Get some moving blankets. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=85.5s)]
*  Some super professional voice actors, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=87.0s)]
*  they don't even have a fancy booth, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=89.0s)]
*  they're just using moving blankets from the hardware store. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=90.5s)]
*  The takeaway? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=93.0s)]
*  Hard flat surfaces like these are your enemy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=94.0s)]
*  You could get fancy acoustic foam to hang on your walls, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=98.0s)]
*  like the kind that John has, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=100.5s)]
*  but choosing a room with a lot of soft stuff, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=102.0s)]
*  rugs, couches, things hanging on the walls, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=104.5s)]
*  will get you close. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=107.5s)]
*  Number two, your microphone. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=109.0s)]
*  When it comes to your microphone, size matters. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=111.5s)]
*  The part of the microphone that captures your voice [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=114.5s)]
*  is called a capsule. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=117.0s)]
*  The bigger the capsule, the better the sound. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=118.5s)]
*  I've been doing some testing, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=120.5s)]
*  and if you're looking for something better than your earbuds, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=121.5s)]
*  try this one. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=124.0s)]
*  Sure, it's not as good as John's $1,000 professional mic, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=125.5s)]
*  but the $130 Blue Yeti does a great job [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=129.5s)]
*  at producing warm, clear audio for video calls. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=132.5s)]
*  It's not a solution for phone calls on your smartphone. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=135.5s)]
*  It's best if you're at your computer. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=138.5s)]
*  It works with a Mac or PC, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=140.5s)]
*  and its mic is pretty much plug and play, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=142.0s)]
*  though there are some knobs in the back you need to know about. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=144.0s)]
*  You can actually flip it onto a setting [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=146.5s)]
*  that's more built for voice only, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=148.0s)]
*  as opposed to picking up other stuff. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=150.5s)]
*  Is it this one? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=152.5s)]
*  Yep, that's the one. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=154.0s)]
*  If you work in a large echoey room like me, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=155.0s)]
*  you can also turn the gain dial down [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=157.5s)]
*  to reduce some of that environmental noise. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=159.0s)]
*  There is one important no button trick to remember, though. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=161.5s)]
*  That is all you have to do. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=165.0s)]
*  You make a Y-shaped bra, all right, hang ten, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=166.0s)]
*  take your ten and put your pinky at the mic [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=168.5s)]
*  and your thumb at your mouth. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=171.0s)]
*  That's how far away from the mic you should be. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=172.0s)]
*  Yes, if you have a high quality microphone, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=174.0s)]
*  maintaining that hang loose distance is very important. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=176.5s)]
*  But for smaller microphones, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=179.5s)]
*  you'll tend to get better audio if it's closer to your mouth. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=181.0s)]
*  That's why for important calls, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=184.0s)]
*  I prefer a headset like this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=186.0s)]
*  Call center style. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=188.5s)]
*  This one is the Logitech Zone Wireless, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=190.0s)]
*  which has a little arm that holds out the microphone. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=192.5s)]
*  Number three, your connection. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=195.0s)]
*  Connection is obviously very important. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=197.5s)]
*  You know, if you have a great setup, great mic, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=199.5s)]
*  it doesn't matter if you have a shoddy connection. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=201.5s)]
*  It's 100% true. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=203.5s)]
*  Slow internet speeds or a bad Wi-Fi signal [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=205.5s)]
*  can make you sound terrible. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=208.5s)]
*  So for video calls, a wired connection [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=210.5s)]
*  over an Ethernet cable is best. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=212.5s)]
*  But if that's not an option, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=215.0s)]
*  sitting close to your router can also improve [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=216.5s)]
*  the strength of your connection. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=218.5s)]
*  You can also turn off your video [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=220.5s)]
*  to save that bandwidth for audio. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=222.5s)]
*  The service you choose also matters. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=224.5s)]
*  For instance, the Zoom video conferencing app [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=227.0s)]
*  automatically suppresses background noise and echo. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=229.5s)]
*  Test your mic in the app's audio settings. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=233.0s)]
*  Then click on Advanced to turn up the feature [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=235.5s)]
*  to Aggressive or Off. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=238.0s)]
*  Lastly, using a wired headset like this one [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=240.0s)]
*  can eliminate any Bluetooth or interference issues. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=243.0s)]
*  And while all of these tips should help you sound better, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=246.0s)]
*  they probably can't transform you into John. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=249.0s)]
*  Rated PG-13, starts writing in theaters everywhere, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=253.5s)]
*  except that the theaters are closed. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24XvPV8XlyA&t=256.0s)]
