# NASA’s Plan B Why SpaceX Is Completing Boeing’s Starliner Mission  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk)
*  Two NASA astronauts, Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore, who traveled to the International [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=0.0s)]
*  Space Station on an eight-day mission, could now end up staying there for over eight months [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=6.82s)]
*  because of problems with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=11.96s)]
*  To add insult to injury, NASA announced that the crew will return to Earth on a spacecraft [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  from Boeing's competitor, SpaceX, in February of 2025. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=19.6s)]
*  There's just a lot of uncertainty about what happens to the Starliner program. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  You know, this might not look good right now, but we don't know the end of it yet. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  Here's a breakdown of Boeing's Starliner saga and what it could mean for the aerospace giant. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=32.96s)]
*  Boeing has faced a lot of technical challenges with developing this vehicle all the way back [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=39.24s)]
*  to, you know, 2019. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=44.04s)]
*  One ignition and liftoff of Starliner and Atlas V. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=46.04s)]
*  When Starliner did finally take off on June 5th, more technical problems disrupted the flight. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=52.4s)]
*  There are two main kind of buckets of problems that came up during Starliner's flight to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=58.12s)]
*  the International Space Station. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=63.4s)]
*  One relates to thrusters that are used to maneuver the spacecraft. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=65.12s)]
*  A handful of them temporarily failed as the vehicle was docking, you know, with the space station. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  And then the second bucket of problems are helium leaks. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=76.28s)]
*  The helium is used to pressurize the propulsion system and NASA and Boeing discovered several [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=79.66000000000001s)]
*  leaks on board that system, you know, during the flight. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=86.42s)]
*  The crew did manage to arrive at the International Space Station safely. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=90.58000000000001s)]
*  And followed shortly behind by Commander of Starliner Butch Wilmore. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=94.9s)]
*  But Starliner's problems raised concerns at NASA. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=99.14000000000001s)]
*  The agency talked about returning Starliner as early as June 14th, but NASA delayed the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  return several times. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=107.34s)]
*  On August 7th, NASA said that the return date could be pushed to February 2025. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=109.61999999999999s)]
*  NASA has been debating risk, basically, and how much risk does Starliner pose to the astronauts, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=115.34s)]
*  Barry Wilmore, Sunita Williams? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=126.34s)]
*  I'm not sure that NASA has had to make a call, make a decision in the face of uncertainty [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=128.42s)]
*  about a human spaceflight program with humans on orbit and human lives potentially at stake [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=134.76s)]
*  in a really long time. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=140.04s)]
*  In early August, NASA said it was considering tapping SpaceX to ferry the astronauts back [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=141.56s)]
*  home. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=146.72s)]
*  SpaceX didn't respond to a request for comment. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=147.72s)]
*  Boeing has said, just sort of simply put, that Starliner is ready to go and the data [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=150.67999999999998s)]
*  supports using Starliner to take the two astronauts back to Earth. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  NASA has been in this kind of intense, you know, one leader there recently called it [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=163.4s)]
*  vigorous like debate about the risks that Starliner may pose to the two astronauts [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=169.44s)]
*  if it is used to ferry them back to Earth. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=175.6s)]
*  Long before this current Starliner mission, the spacecraft's development was dogged by [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=179.52s)]
*  problems. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=184.16s)]
*  Boeing has been working on Starliner for more than a decade and the program has been [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=185.16s)]
*  beset with delays. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=189.36s)]
*  Starliner was born at the end of NASA's space shuttle program in 2011. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=193.6s)]
*  Shortly after that, the agency hired Boeing and SpaceX to each independently develop spacecrafts [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=198.2s)]
*  to ferry astronauts to and from the space station. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=204.04s)]
*  NASA wanted to have two different American companies to basically back each other up. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=206.72s)]
*  If something happens with one company, the other could be right there to continue the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=211.72s)]
*  flights, continue the missions, continue the science. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  You never want to just have one option. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=220.4s)]
*  That's what we found with the space shuttle way back when, you know, when we had the first [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=222.36s)]
*  accident. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  There was a lot put into one vehicle. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=227.88000000000002s)]
*  So having a second option is really important and we're seeing it now because even though [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=229.88000000000002s)]
*  we're having some issues and delays with the Starliner, we're still able to at least [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=234.8s)]
*  carry on the operations of the space station by using the Crew Dragon. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=240.16000000000003s)]
*  Boeing struggles with Starliner, contrasted sharply with the development of SpaceX's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=244.36s)]
*  Crew Dragon. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=248.4s)]
*  SpaceX has now flown nine different missions for NASA. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=249.44s)]
*  That includes their test flight, you know, a few years ago. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=253.8s)]
*  Boeing has flown, you know, call it half of one. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=257.12s)]
*  I mean, they've taken astronauts up to the space station, no easy feat, but have not, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=261.6s)]
*  you know, brought them back yet. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=267.56s)]
*  I think right now it's a tough time for Boeing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=268.76s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=270.72s)]
*  Maybe it makes it a little harder, at least the optics of it, because the perception now [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=272.4s)]
*  is that SpaceX is running things splendidly, you know, they're having a lot of success. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=276.56s)]
*  And I think the game's not over yet. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=281.44s)]
*  When NASA selected Boeing and SpaceX to develop the Starliner and Crew Dragon spacecrafts, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=283.96s)]
*  the agency signed fixed price agreements with each contractor. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=289.52s)]
*  The company and NASA agree to a number and then it's up to the company to come up with [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=293.16s)]
*  a way to stay under that number. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=298.76s)]
*  The idea is you're incentivizing your contractor to, you know, perform well so they can make [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=300.88s)]
*  some money. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=308.64s)]
*  Boeing has struggled financially with Starliner. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=309.64s)]
*  They've disclosed more than 1.4 billion in charges or losses related to the program. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=314.52s)]
*  And there's some real questions about whether the company is going to ever, you know, see [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=322.04s)]
*  any return from years and years of investment. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=328.4s)]
*  That NASA has now turned to SpaceX to complete the mission is a tough outcome for Boeing, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=332.67999999999995s)]
*  which has deep ties to NASA that date to the Apollo moon landings. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=337.64s)]
*  If you look back at executive commentary from Boeing, you know, years ago, folks there thought [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=341.44s)]
*  that they would be first, that Boeing would beat SpaceX to transport NASA astronauts to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=346.28s)]
*  and from the International Space Station. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=351.79999999999995s)]
*  And it obviously has not worked out the way they, many executives and leaders at Boeing [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=354.36s)]
*  thought it would. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=361.32s)]
*  It kind of signals a changing of the guard in the space industry. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=362.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's not all roses. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=364.88s)]
*  You know, you have ups and downs. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=366.36s)]
*  That's the way life is. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  And I think from the experience I've had as an astronaut, I think it's really the mark [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=369.64s)]
*  of a good team to be able to recover from that. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  And how do you recover from that adversity? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=376.24s)]
*  So I think it's an opportunity for Boeing. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=378.44s)]
*  They didn't plan this. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=380.6s)]
*  They didn't want this to happen. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=381.6s)]
*  They would have much rather have brought them home in eight days. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=382.6s)]
*  Okay, next, you know, and move on. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=384.8s)]
*  But that didn't happen that way. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=386.6s)]
*  We'll be happy to go back home when it's our time to go back home. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  But you can't do this on Earth. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  So this makes it special. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgqkZC4hKTk&t=394.72s)]
