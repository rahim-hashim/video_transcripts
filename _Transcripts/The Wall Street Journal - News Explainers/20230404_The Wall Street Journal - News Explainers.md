# Why Gold Still Shines Through Inflation, Banking Crises and More  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU)
*  For commodities, it seems that all that glitters is gold. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=0.0s)]
*  Amid recent turmoil in the financial system and concerns over the health of the global [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=3.54s)]
*  economy, gold has remained stable. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=7.36s)]
*  Here's why the precious metal is continuing to shine. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=9.6s)]
*  Investors piled into gold in March, the price is currently hovering at just under $2,000 [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  an ounce, and it has risen 8.4% this year. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  The recent rise comes after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=21.16s)]
*  the US and the takeover of Swiss bank Credit Suisse by its rival UBS. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=25.16s)]
*  A late March selloff in Germany's Deutsche Bank has also ramped up concerns about the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=29.56s)]
*  financial system, but yet gold has sparkled through the chaos. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=33.6s)]
*  Investors value gold for its stability during uncertain times, and often look to the precious [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=38.08s)]
*  metal as an alternative to the traditional banking system. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=42.2s)]
*  Here's one example of its recent appeal. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=45.36s)]
*  In the week following the SVB collapse, net inflows into gold exchange traded funds stood [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=47.8s)]
*  at roughly 14 tonnes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=52.2s)]
*  That's over $1bn worth. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=53.68s)]
*  For a couple of months before the collapse, investors had been pulling money out of funds. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=56.32s)]
*  In March, gold benefited from expectations that central banks would reduce the speed [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=61.32s)]
*  of interest rate hikes in order to cut pressure on the financial system. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=65.76s)]
*  Over the last year, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates in a bid to tame inflation. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=70.04s)]
*  These hikes made gold less attractive for investors because unlike other investments, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  the metal does not pay interest. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=79.36s)]
*  In March, Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced yet another rate rise, but he hinted that [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=81.84s)]
*  it could be the last one for now, leading to a jump in gold prices. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=87.0s)]
*  We no longer state that we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  to quell inflation. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=95.0s)]
*  Gold is also getting a boost from a decline in the dollar. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=96.68s)]
*  A week of dollar lifts the price of commodities that are backed by the US currency, one of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  which is gold. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=103.36s)]
*  To compare, gold had a more lacklustre year in 2022. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=104.98s)]
*  It was briefly trading at about $2,000 an ounce following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=109.5s)]
*  However, as the Fed began lifting its rates to curb inflation, the dollar soared to a [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=114.5s)]
*  20-year high, which led to a slight climb down in gold prices. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=119.06s)]
*  But the US dollar has since retreated from its 2022 peak, which has enabled gold prices [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=122.1s)]
*  to bounce back. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=127.06s)]
*  Towards the end of March, gold prices rose towards its record level, before dropping [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=128.06s)]
*  down slightly. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=132.58s)]
*  That's as rescue measures for struggling banks helped ease contagion fears. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=133.58s)]
*  However, analysts expect gold to remain resilient. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=137.82s)]
*  It has been performing strongly, remaining above $1,500 an ounce for the last three years, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=140.82s)]
*  according to the World Gold Council. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=146.02s)]
*  Analysts at Fitch Solutions believe that mounting global financial instability is likely to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=148.1s)]
*  keep on driving up gold prices, solidifying its reputation as a safe haven asset. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK69yhjZHKU&t=152.06s)]
