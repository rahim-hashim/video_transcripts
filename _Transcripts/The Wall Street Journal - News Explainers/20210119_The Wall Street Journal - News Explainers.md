# The Coronavirus Is Mutating. Hereâ€™s What We Know  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 19, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg)
*  New coronavirus variants have been detected in over 40 countries, including the UK, South [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=0.0s)]
*  Africa, Nigeria and Brazil, where they first emerged. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=5.96s)]
*  Now health officials say a new threat is identified in South Africa. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  British officials imposed a new lockdown across England. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=12.76s)]
*  Recent reports of a new highly contagious coronavirus variant in the United States. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=16.88s)]
*  In the U.S., multiple states have reported new variants or versions of the virus with [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=22.44s)]
*  mutations that could change how it spreads. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=27.78s)]
*  New research suggests that some of these variants are highly transmissible, and at least one [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=30.5s)]
*  may reduce how well vaccines work. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=35.38s)]
*  With countries around the world already facing escalating infections and overwhelmed hospitals, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=37.78s)]
*  these mutations could make ending the pandemic more difficult. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  We'll explain. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=47.14s)]
*  Like other viruses, the coronavirus spreads by infecting cells and then reproducing within [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=50.02s)]
*  creating copies of itself that spread throughout the body. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=56.1s)]
*  As new versions are made, the virus's genetic code, which holds the instructions for building [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=59.06s)]
*  new virus particles, is copied over and over again. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=64.06s)]
*  But the code isn't always reproduced correctly. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=68.22s)]
*  Small genetic mistakes or mutations can create new viral variants. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=71.5s)]
*  If the new version of the virus has mutations that allow it to spread faster than the current [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=76.10000000000001s)]
*  most common variant, it could lead to a surge in new cases. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=80.98s)]
*  This is already happening in places like the U.K. and South Africa, where some of the newest [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=85.5s)]
*  ones were first found. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=90.36s)]
*  Current data suggests the U.K. variant could be 50% to 70% more transmissible, but the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=92.42s)]
*  research is still early. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=98.5s)]
*  To determine how transmissible and dangerous a virus mutation might be, scientists run [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  a series of experiments in the lab. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=105.9s)]
*  The first step is genetic sequencing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=108.4s)]
*  As genetic sequencing gets to the blueprint of what the viruses are, we can use samples [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=110.7s)]
*  and data from actual humans to figure out what the genetics of the viruses are. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=117.42s)]
*  To do this, scientists take a sample of the mutated virus and sequence its genes. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=122.54s)]
*  Then computational programs help scientists identify mutations. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=127.98s)]
*  Once we know what they are and now we can see that, oh, well, this is an important population, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=132.18s)]
*  we can start manipulating the virus. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=137.34s)]
*  We can either start working with clinical isolates of that virus or we can actually [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=139.02s)]
*  make the strains. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=142.38000000000002s)]
*  So putting those individual mutations into the backbone of viruses that we already have. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=144.18s)]
*  After sequencing the virus, scientists test the variant in a lab. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=148.78s)]
*  What we do is we compare how well the virus replicates in different types of cells. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=152.18s)]
*  And so there are two ways. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=156.78s)]
*  We will just do infections and kind of measure the level of the virus over time in these [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=157.98000000000002s)]
*  cell types. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=163.5s)]
*  And the other thing that we'll do is a competition assay, where we'll take 50% of the wild type, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=164.5s)]
*  the original strain, and 50% of the mutant strain, and then compare how well they grow. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=168.78s)]
*  If there's an advantage, we'll see that, that after 24 hours or after 48 hours, one [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=174.1s)]
*  of the two might outcompete. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=178.78s)]
*  During lab experiments, researchers can also test whether human antibodies created by infection [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=180.66s)]
*  or vaccines are effective at fighting the new form of the virus. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=186.3s)]
*  After culture testing, scientists typically move on to animal models and then sometimes [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=190.54s)]
*  to humans. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=195.42000000000002s)]
*  Right now, the research is still early, but scientists are beginning to get a clearer [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=196.42s)]
*  picture of what these variants look like. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=201.01999999999998s)]
*  From sequencing, they know the UK variant has 17 key mutations. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=203.98s)]
*  These variants that we're seeing, these changes, give a small advantage in terms of the ability [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=209.1s)]
*  of the virus to replicate or transmit. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=214.22s)]
*  This has a lot to do with the spike protein, which is critical to how the virus spreads. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=216.22s)]
*  A portion of the spike binds to a receptor on human cells, like a key, fitting into a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=221.22s)]
*  lock. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=226.7s)]
*  This enables it to enter and infect. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=227.7s)]
*  Scientists found that the UK variant spike proteins have eight amino acid changes. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=230.94s)]
*  Previous research appears to show that some of these changes may be increasing the protein's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=235.66s)]
*  ability to cling onto and enter human cells. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=240.94s)]
*  This could be making it more transmissible, which means a higher vaccination rate may [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=244.73999999999998s)]
*  be needed to reach herd immunity. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=248.61999999999998s)]
*  Another big question is the virulence, or how harmful these new versions of the virus [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=251.06s)]
*  could be. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=255.78s)]
*  Scientists say that most likely, the new variants don't cause a more severe form of COVID-19. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=257.34s)]
*  Another question is whether the new versions will show up on tests. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=264.18s)]
*  Early data appears to show that most COVID and antibody testing will continue to work. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=268.06s)]
*  We should still be able to tell if you have COVID. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=273.1s)]
*  What's less clear is that we can tell if you have a specific variant or not. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=275.62s)]
*  The most pressing issue is whether vaccines will still be effective. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=279.14000000000004s)]
*  For the UK variant, it appears that they will. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=283.5s)]
*  However, for the variant originating in South Africa, preliminary data is worrying some [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=286.1s)]
*  scientists. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=291.3s)]
*  Researchers say that any of the more transmissible variants could eventually become dominant. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=293.1s)]
*  We've seen variants take over in terms of the D614G mutation, and it wouldn't surprise [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=297.66s)]
*  me if the South African or the UK variant do a similar thing where it becomes a dominant [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=303.70000000000005s)]
*  variant around the world just because of a small fitness advantage or small changes that [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=308.62s)]
*  make the virus more thin. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=314.02s)]
*  To try to stem the spread, certain countries like the UK have already imposed strict lockdown [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=315.97999999999996s)]
*  measures. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=321.7s)]
*  The number of patients in hospitals in England is now 40% higher than the first peak in April. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=322.7s)]
*  It is inescapable that the facts are changing and we must change our response. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=328.82s)]
*  And so we have no choice but to return to a national lockdown. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=333.9s)]
*  While the new variants are concerning, experts say that current prevention measures should [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=338.5s)]
*  continue to work. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=343.41999999999996s)]
*  This isn't something that's completely overcoming masks or distancing. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  And so if these measures are put in place in more strict or more effective ways, it'll [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=348.73999999999995s)]
*  be just as effective, if not more effective. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=354.65999999999997s)]
*  And the outcome may be that, you know, being a little bit more serious about this will [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=356.85999999999996s)]
*  get transmission as a whole to be reduced. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=360.94s)]
*  And I think that's an ideal. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=363.5s)]
*  Experts say the coronavirus pandemic could be on the cusp of a major shift. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=365.66s)]
*  But more research is needed to know how severe the impact of the new variants will be. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8I00TWPtg&t=370.26000000000005s)]
