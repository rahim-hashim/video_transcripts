# The Disney v. DeSantis Lawsuit: What's at Stake? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0)
*  The Walt Disney Company filed a lawsuit against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=0.0s)]
*  accusing the conservative politician of a, quote, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=5.4s)]
*  targeted campaign of government retaliation against the media giant. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  DeSantis has dismissed the lawsuit as political. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=12.36s)]
*  The days of putting one company on a pedestal with [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=15.52s)]
*  no accountability are over in the state of Florida. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=18.76s)]
*  Ariane Campoflores has been covering the year-long power struggle for the journal. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=21.72s)]
*  He explains what you need to know about Disney versus DeSantis. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=26.04s)]
*  The dispute between Disney and Governor DeSantis began over a law that DeSantis signed last year [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=31.84s)]
*  called the Parental Rights and Education Law, which critics call the Don't Say Gay Law. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=41.56s)]
*  And it essentially restricted classroom instruction on issues of gender identity and sexual orientation. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=45.84s)]
*  We were opposed to the bill from the outset, but we chose not to take a public position on it [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=52.92s)]
*  because we thought we could be more effective working behind the scenes, engaging directly with lawmakers. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  And after Disney came out against that law, it triggered this escalating battle [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=65.04s)]
*  between the company and the governor that culminated in the governor basically stripping Disney [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=70.16s)]
*  of its control of a special tax district that allowed it to self-govern the land that houses its theme parks [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=76.28s)]
*  and save tens of millions of dollars. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=82.88s)]
*  The corporate kingdom finally came to an end. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  Earlier this year, the governor and the legislature decided that instead of ending the district, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  they would retain it, but rename it the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  and remove the board of supervisors that had long been controlled by Disney, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  instead authorize the governor to pick the members of that board of supervisors. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  Okay, it is in the books right here. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  Disney had secured a number of agreements with the previous board that basically locked in zoning and infrastructure [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  and other rights that would allow it to develop these properties in the future. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  On April 26th, this new board declared that these agreements were null and void. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=132.24s)]
*  Disney picked the fight with this board. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=137.72s)]
*  We were not looking out for a fight. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=140.56s)]
*  Disney sued the governor and the board members and others in federal court in Tallahassee. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=143.36s)]
*  What they said in the lawsuit was that the governor had basically orchestrated a campaign of retaliation [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=150.24s)]
*  against the company for having exercised its free speech rights. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=157.24s)]
*  And so what Disney is seeking with this lawsuit is for a court to find that these agreements that Disney secured are valid. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  Governor DeSantis has given very little indication that he's going to back down on this fight. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't think the suit has married. I think it's political. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  And so it looks like the parties are going to be locked in litigation for quite some time. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  What's at stake for DeSantis is the potential effect of all this on his presidential aspirations. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=182.68s)]
*  It's widely expected that he will likely run for president in 2024. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=190.28s)]
*  The argument that he has made for a potential presidential run is that he is someone who is willing to take on corporations. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=196.48s)]
*  We will never, ever surrender. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=203.72s)]
*  And that he is someone who wins policy fights. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=205.84s)]
*  And so that puts an imperative really on him to emerge victorious from this battle. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4mWpbRaKf0&t=208.4s)]
