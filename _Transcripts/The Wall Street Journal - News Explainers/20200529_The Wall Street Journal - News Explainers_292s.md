# How the Government Creates Stimulus Money | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 29, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI)
*  When the economy screeched to a halt in mid-March, businesses shut down almost overnight, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=0.0s)]
*  quickly millions of workers became unemployed. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Within weeks, the government moved to provide trillions of dollars of stimulus relief to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=10.86s)]
*  workers and businesses throughout the economy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=14.9s)]
*  $1,200 checks to anyone who makes less than $75,000. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=17.84s)]
*  This is another $600 a week for four months. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=22.32s)]
*  Congress approving another $484 billion for loans. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=25.2s)]
*  So where does all this money come from? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  Is it taxpayer funds? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=33.16s)]
*  Is the government printing a bunch of new cash? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=34.64s)]
*  As you might expect, there's a lot more to know. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=37.44s)]
*  Congress can authorize taxes to pay for new spending, but that's not where the stimulus [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=42.32s)]
*  money is coming from. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=46.34s)]
*  That money is being raised through borrowing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=48.04s)]
*  The government expects to borrow a record $4.5 trillion for the fiscal year that ends [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=51.16s)]
*  in September. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=56.279999999999994s)]
*  That's more than three times the $1.28 trillion it borrowed the year prior. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=57.279999999999994s)]
*  That borrowed money is being used to subsidize small business payrolls, send checks to households, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  and offer taxpayers a temporary holiday on making tax payments. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=68.19999999999999s)]
*  The Treasury Department is in charge of the borrowing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=72.52s)]
*  The agency borrows by selling Treasury bills or bonds to the three main groups of savers. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=75.42s)]
*  The public sector, like other parts of the government. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=81.3s)]
*  The private sector, which includes companies or individuals like you and me, and foreign [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  entities. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=88.66s)]
*  These bills are like IOUs. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=90.86s)]
*  Someone agrees to buy them and the government agrees to pay them back with a little bit [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=92.94s)]
*  of interest. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=96.54s)]
*  In the meantime, the government can use that borrowed money for stimulus to support private [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=97.54s)]
*  individuals and companies or state and local governments. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=102.22s)]
*  This year, the federal government will get most of its borrowing from the private sector. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=104.86s)]
*  And the reason for that is because private borrowers who would normally be competing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=110.53999999999999s)]
*  with the federal government for private savings have basically disappeared. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=115.06s)]
*  That stimulus money can make the economy larger than it otherwise would have been. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=120.42s)]
*  It encourages employers to keep people employed. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=124.42s)]
*  And it encourages individuals to spend. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=127.42s)]
*  Here's a hypothetical example. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  Let's say Congress authorizes $1 billion in stimulus spending. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=131.94s)]
*  The Treasury would borrow $1 billion by selling Treasury bills. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=136.1s)]
*  It would then use that borrowed money on the stimulus programs with the hopes of keeping [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=140.18s)]
*  the economy churning. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=144.34s)]
*  But it doesn't end there. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=146.26s)]
*  If the economy keeps moving, households and businesses can keep earning income and some [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=148.02s)]
*  of that income can be saved. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=152.5s)]
*  And in the future, they can use those savings to invest in more Treasury bills supplying [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=154.62s)]
*  the government with more money to spend. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=158.78s)]
*  The amount of saving in the economy is not a fixed amount. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=161.38s)]
*  Federal stimulus can actually result in more people working, more firms having profits, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  higher incomes than would have been the case if there hadn't been any federal stimulus [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=168.98s)]
*  at all. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=172.54s)]
*  This is known as Keynesian stimulus, named for the British economist John Maynard Keynes, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=173.54s)]
*  who first came up with the concept back in the 1930s. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=177.46s)]
*  The government is not like a family that has a fixed amount and can't borrow more than [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=180.78s)]
*  it can pay back because it'll go bankrupt. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=185.01999999999998s)]
*  The government can, in effect, borrow enough to actually make the economy bigger. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=187.46s)]
*  Now, on top of the three main sources of borrowing, there's another source too, the Federal Reserve. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=193.46s)]
*  The central bank is like the other sources, but with a key difference. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=199.86s)]
*  The Fed can raise funds to buy Treasuries by simply printing money. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=203.66000000000003s)]
*  So when we say the Fed is printing money, we don't literally mean it's firing up the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  printing presses and creating paper money. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=211.94s)]
*  Instead, what we mean is the Fed basically clicks a button and credits the Treasury's [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=214.34s)]
*  account with this money. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=218.82s)]
*  It's electronic money. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=221.02s)]
*  It's not paper money. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  In effect, the Treasury sells a bond and in return gets brand new money. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=223.58s)]
*  Right now, the Fed is ramping up its lending. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=229.3s)]
*  Assets on the central bank's balance sheet topped $6.7 trillion during the first week [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=232.22s)]
*  of May 2020. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=237.18s)]
*  That gives the Treasury more money to spend on stimulating the economy and other programs. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=239.06s)]
*  Critics of the stimulus say the government competing with other borrowers for savings [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=244.73999999999998s)]
*  will push up interest rates, making it harder for private companies and individuals to borrow [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=248.85999999999999s)]
*  and invest. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  They also say that if the Fed prints money to finance the borrowing, that will lead to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  inflation and economic turmoil like what's seen in Venezuela and the trillion-dollar [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=259.14s)]
*  notes seen in Zimbabwe. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=263.14s)]
*  It's only a problem if they print and they print and they print and those dollars get [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=265.3s)]
*  spent and spent and spent again until all that spending far exceeds the supply of goods [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=268.26s)]
*  and services in our economy. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=273.46s)]
*  That's when you get high inflation. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=275.38s)]
*  How will we know that's happening? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=277.18s)]
*  Well, we probably see long-term interest rates start to rise as investors get ready for the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=278.34s)]
*  approach of inflation. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=282.38s)]
*  Then we'd start to see actual inflation rise. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=283.94s)]
*  But we're not seeing that now. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZpYgQiZXhI&t=285.97999999999996s)]
