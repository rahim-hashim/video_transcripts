# Why the U.S. Buys So Much Nuclear Fuel From Russia  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ)
*  The U.S. is the world's largest producer of nuclear power, but it depends on Russia [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=0.0s)]
*  for about 24% of its enriched uranium, a key ingredient for nuclear fuel, even with enrichment [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=4.96s)]
*  facilities owned by friendly countries. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=11.0s)]
*  We still don't have enough if Russian supply was not available in the marketplace. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=13.1s)]
*  That's why nuclear fuel is one of the few Russian energy sources not banned by the West [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=18.36s)]
*  as a result of the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=22.88s)]
*  But Russia is incredibly willing to use energy as a weapon. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=25.04s)]
*  Here's how the U.S. is working to revive domestic production, to reduce the risk of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=29.2s)]
*  a critical fuel shortage in the future. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=33.44s)]
*  Nuclear reactors generate nearly 20% of U.S. electricity, but demand is quickly rising [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=36.9s)]
*  as the U.S. races to meet its clean energy goals. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  We're seeing it from our utilities. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=44.2s)]
*  We're seeing it from oil, gas, chemical companies, big tech firms. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=46.0s)]
*  But more nuclear energy requires more nuclear fuel, and the U.S. currently lacks the capacity [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  to produce its own. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  That's because uranium ore goes through four main processes to become nuclear fuel. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=56.63999999999999s)]
*  And the U.S. relies on other countries for three of those steps. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=61.72s)]
*  First, raw uranium is mined out of the ground and milled. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=65.52s)]
*  Then it's converted into a gas and enriched, increasing the percentage of the radioactive isotope. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  Finally, the uranium is fabricated into fuel pellets that are stacked inside metal fuel [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=74.84s)]
*  rods and loaded into a nuclear reactor. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=79.08s)]
*  The U.S. gets most of its uranium ore from Canada and Kazakhstan. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=81.94s)]
*  Even though Russia isn't a leader, it is substantially involved in Kazakhstan's mining operations. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=85.98s)]
*  There's only one U.S.-owned converter, and there's no U.S.-owned enricher for the current [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=91.42s)]
*  fleet of nuclear reactors. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=95.94s)]
*  Meanwhile, Russia dominates both of those steps. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=97.74000000000001s)]
*  We've seen that Russia is willing to use its energy resources as a tool of leverage. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=100.62s)]
*  The sooner we can move ourselves away from that potential vulnerability, the better off [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=106.38000000000001s)]
*  we're all going to be. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=111.22s)]
*  In an effort to reshore as many steps of this supply chain as possible, a number of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=112.66s)]
*  U.S. companies are ramping up capacity. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=117.02s)]
*  For example, mining company Energy Fuels is restarting this conventional uranium mine [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=119.7s)]
*  in LaSalle, Utah, after signing long-term contracts with two nuclear utilities in 2022. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=124.38s)]
*  LaSalle Complex, as we call it, is a mine that dates back to the 50s and operated for [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=130.5s)]
*  20, 30 years. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=135.98s)]
*  And then it really kind of went dormant for a number of years. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=137.74s)]
*  The last commercial production of uranium at LaSalle was in 2014. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=141.14s)]
*  Now with increasing uranium prices, we're going back into full production in 2024. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=145.1s)]
*  Energy Fuels is currently hiring about 50 miners, purchasing and refurbishing equipment, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=150.77999999999997s)]
*  and doing maintenance work. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=156.38s)]
*  Our plans are to restart mining about 70,000 tons of uranium per year, at least initially. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=157.6s)]
*  Not quite enough for a single large-scale nuclear reactor. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=164.17999999999998s)]
*  Chalmers says he doesn't expect uranium mining in the U.S. to replace larger producers like [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=167.9s)]
*  Canada. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=172.70000000000002s)]
*  Instead, he sees it as a way to diversify the country's sources of raw uranium. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  With the contracts that we have, we can make nice margins, but we're going to need higher [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=178.6s)]
*  uranium prices that justify restarting of production, because every time we restart [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=182.70000000000002s)]
*  a mine, they get more expensive. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=188.14000000000001s)]
*  Along with its mines, Energy Fuels also plans to restart White Mesa Mill in 2024, the only [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  operating conventional uranium mill in the U.S. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=195.66s)]
*  This is where uranium ore goes after its mined and before it goes to a conversion facility. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=198.7s)]
*  This came from the LaSalle complex, and that's Utah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  This came from New Mexico. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=205.96s)]
*  On the enrichment front, Centris Energy launched the only U.S.-owned uranium enrichment plant [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=208.9s)]
*  earlier this year. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=213.5s)]
*  It made its first delivery of high-assay, low-enriched uranium, or HALU, to the U.S. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=214.74s)]
*  Department of Energy in November. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=219.5s)]
*  HALU will be used in the next generation of advanced reactors. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=221.62s)]
*  As these reactors are still being developed, many proponents of nuclear energy see the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=225.14s)]
*  HALU supply chain as an opportunity for the U.S. to become a global leader. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=229.54s)]
*  When these advanced reactors were initially coming to market, their plan was to buy from [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=234.1s)]
*  Russia, which is the only commercial supplier of that fuel type today. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  In light of the Russian assault on Ukraine, those plans have changed. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=242.94s)]
*  As part of the Inflation Reduction Act, $700 million was invested to support the development [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=246.56s)]
*  of a domestic supply chain for HALU. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=251.42s)]
*  Russia's dominance in the uranium supply chain can be traced back to a program called [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=254.46s)]
*  Megatons to Megawatts. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=258.42s)]
*  The goal of this program was for Russia to downgrade the uranium from its nuclear weapons [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=260.26s)]
*  to levels needed for nuclear reactors, and then sell that fuel to the U.S. for cheap. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=264.58s)]
*  Since 2013, when that program expired, we've still had a lot of commercial activity with [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=269.5s)]
*  Russia because of those strong commercial relationships that had been built up. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=275.5s)]
*  In the 90s, the U.S. also privatized its uranium enrichment operations. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=280.62s)]
*  But without federal support, the country's two enrichment facilities eventually had to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=284.86s)]
*  be shut down. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=289.1s)]
*  Kotech says one of the biggest challenges of building up domestic capability is giving [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=291.18s)]
*  companies the confidence that their investments will pay off. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=295.5s)]
*  Federal support, we think, is crucial. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=299.1s)]
*  There's no such thing as a nuclear fuel cycle without some level of government support. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=300.98s)]
*  Russia is really operating as a state-owned enterprise. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=305.38s)]
*  Kotech says the industry needs federal investment in both infrastructure and long-term contracts [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=308.9s)]
*  with utility companies. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=314.09999999999997s)]
*  Utilities are the owners and operators of nuclear reactors that pay for each step of [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=315.82s)]
*  this process. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=320.06s)]
*  In October, the Biden administration sent a proposal to Congress to invest around $2 [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=321.5s)]
*  billion to improve long-term domestic enrichment capabilities. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=326.09999999999997s)]
*  We requested this as an administration because it is a high priority. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=329.82s)]
*  In the long term, we would like to see this commercial industry stand on its own without [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=334.06s)]
*  consistent and forever federal investment. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=338.68s)]
*  A bipartisan group in Congress is also pushing legislation to ban U.S. use of Russian uranium. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=341.96s)]
*  Nothing happens quickly in the nuclear fuel cycle. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=348.16s)]
*  When you lose your capabilities, like we've done in the United States, you're looking [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=351.08s)]
*  at probably 10 to 15 years plus to reestablish those capabilities. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=355.22s)]
*  It's important to invest quickly so that it's an aggressive expansion and we don't [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=360.36s)]
*  run out of uranium before we need it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  Meeting the fuel demands for both today's plants and new plants are going to require [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=367.16s)]
*  a lot of investment in all of those technologies. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFYSAgBNTQ&t=371.16s)]
