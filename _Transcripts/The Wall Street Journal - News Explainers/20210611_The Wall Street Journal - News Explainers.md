# How VW Is Turning Engine Factories Into EV Battery Plants  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 11, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs)
*  This factory in Germany has made engines for some of the most popular cars in the world for over five decades. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=0.0s)]
*  Erewish, you owned a Volkswagen. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=6.0s)]
*  But more recently, some of those cars have lost their shine. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=9.0s)]
*  VW owners coming to grips with the realization that their diesel cars can emit from 10 to 40 times more pollutant. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=12.0s)]
*  We all know that we have let down customers. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=18.0s)]
*  What's more, global sales of internal combustion engines are predicted to drop by over 50% by 2035. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=21.0s)]
*  The hot new market? Electric vehicles. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=27.0s)]
*  So to try and capture that market, VW is transforming this engine factory into its new EV battery facility. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=30.0s)]
*  The first of six that it plans to build in Europe, at a cost of about $15 billion, according to analysts. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=36.0s)]
*  What you see behind has nothing to do with combustion engines, and that shows the size of this transformation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=42.0s)]
*  That means going from making combustion engines that have more than 2,000 moving parts to high-tech electric motors that only have about 20. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=48.0s)]
*  And changing its workforce to do that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=56.0s)]
*  Traditional automakers, if they want to be in this market in 2035, they need to develop just as much as the startups need to develop. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=59.0s)]
*  The EV market is currently dominated by Tesla and faces disruption from a bunch of new startups. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=66.0s)]
*  They have nothing to lose. They start from scratch. We have a lot to lose. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=71.0s)]
*  So could this factory be a blueprint for traditional automakers to survive the EV revolution? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=75.0s)]
*  While VW says that its battery factory in Salzgitter won't be online for another two years or so, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=82.0s)]
*  Tesla already has several Gigafactories in operation and completed its Shanghai facility in under a year. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=89.0s)]
*  It also says it's nearing completion of a huge plant here in Germany. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=95.0s)]
*  We've decided to put Tesla Gigafactory Europe in the Berlin area. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=99.0s)]
*  Other well-funded startups like Lucid and Rivian have set up brand new factories to start EV production this year. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=105.0s)]
*  So legacy automakers like GM, Ford and VW have all announced they're investing billions into EV production to defend their market share, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=111.0s)]
*  with VW committing to $43 billion in five years. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=119.0s)]
*  When you look at what the startups are doing, they don't have to transition. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=123.0s)]
*  They don't have to change a legacy footprint. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=126.0s)]
*  So traditional automakers don't have the luxury of sitting back and saying, ah, we'll wait and see how it goes. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=129.0s)]
*  We are responsible for the people and for our customers, and we have to transform. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=136.0s)]
*  So how is VW investing that money in Salzgitter? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=142.0s)]
*  Well, some of those decisions are made by this engineer, Frank Blom. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=145.0s)]
*  We are building small-scale cells right now, and now we are building up the first mass production plant. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=148.0s)]
*  VW has converted part of its existing factory into labs and a pilot line to test and refine the science behind its batteries. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=155.0s)]
*  It plans to build a brand new facility right next to it, which could produce batteries for over 600,000 vehicles a year [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=162.0s)]
*  and is expected to cost around $2.5 billion, according to analysts. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=168.0s)]
*  Although it says it hasn't finalized the designs for its new facility yet, the factory is expected to be similar to this one in Sweden. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=173.0s)]
*  It's owned by battery supplier Northvolt, and VW is a major investor in the company. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=179.0s)]
*  Thomas Schmoll is CEO of VW's component division. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=185.0s)]
*  The bottleneck will be how fast you can establish, increase and ramp up your battery business. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=188.0s)]
*  Within its labs, VW is trying to figure out what kind of batteries its electric vehicles will need in the future. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=194.0s)]
*  It's testing battery recycling technology, and to get ahead of the competition, it's experimenting with next-generation solid-state batteries, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=199.0s)]
*  which don't contain liquid lithium and promise far faster charging and greater mileage. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=207.0s)]
*  Fast charge is a big, big topic for us. We are working on that with a big workforce. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=212.0s)]
*  The transition will affect everyone in this plant. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=218.0s)]
*  The company will need fewer mechanical engineers and will need new people with totally different skills, like electrochemists or developers, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=222.0s)]
*  as EVs need so much software that VW is set to become one of the largest tech companies in Europe. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=229.0s)]
*  To find the right people is a challenge. It's a new industry. Everybody wants electrochemistry people. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=235.0s)]
*  I think the big outstanding question is we know that it will take fewer employees to build a battery cell pack. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=240.0s)]
*  So therefore, how do you figure that out? Where do you transition people to? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=249.0s)]
*  As the battery plant grows, over time, part of the staff will be retrained, while some legacy jobs are expected to go away. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=254.0s)]
*  At the end of this transition, it's unclear whether the overall number of workers on this site will go down. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=261.0s)]
*  Globally, VW has already made some cuts. In 2019, the company announced that it was cutting some 7,000 jobs over five years, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=265.0s)]
*  and since 2016, it has eliminated at least 23,000 positions by offering early retirement and not replacing workers. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=273.0s)]
*  We always have this issue, oh, maybe it's destroying business. No, it's not right. You can, if you do it right, you can create jobs. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=281.0s)]
*  We will have 1,500, 1,600 employees in the new cell business, what we are doing here, and that's not the end, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=289.0s)]
*  because this is only the first portion, the first part of the cell plant. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=298.0s)]
*  The stakes are particularly high for VW, as it's trying to change its image as a polluter, while also meeting new environmental regulations around the world. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=302.0s)]
*  After the emissions scandal in 2015, VW pleaded guilty to installing a device on its vehicles to cheat US emissions tests. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=310.0s)]
*  It is not only our cars we have to fix, we know we have to repair our credibility too. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=317.0s)]
*  Today, as VW bets big on electric, its US sales are much lower than they were in 2012. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=325.0s)]
*  I think it does dovetail with needing to prove that they're clean and having that kind of hanging over their heads, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=331.0s)]
*  because the news doesn't stop on that. It still does pop up, so the issue isn't completely dead. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=337.0s)]
*  So just like this factory, the decades-old company has to reinvent itself to keep up with technology and beat competitors old and new. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrDzgUXCKgs&t=343.0s)]
