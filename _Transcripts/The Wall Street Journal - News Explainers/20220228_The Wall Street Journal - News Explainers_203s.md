# Swift Sanctions on Russia: How Cutting Off Banks Applies Pressure | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0)
*  I say it's the most important thing right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=0.0s)]
*  After Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the West's sanctions on Russia were [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=3.36s)]
*  not enough to prevent further Russian attacks on his country, a powerful coalition representing [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=7.4s)]
*  some of the world's biggest democracies announced it would block some Russian banks from Swift. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=12.620000000000001s)]
*  The move was part of a series of severe economic penalties, and it was seen as a significant [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=18.48s)]
*  step up in the West's efforts to punish Russia and its president Vladimir Putin for its military [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=23.2s)]
*  assault on Ukraine. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=28.16s)]
*  The European Union and its partners are working to cripple Putin's ability to finance his [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=29.68s)]
*  war machine. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=35.24s)]
*  So what is Swift, and what does this move mean for Russia and the rest of the world? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=36.92s)]
*  Swift, which stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=41.84s)]
*  a global system that banks use to securely send and receive transfer requests. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=47.72s)]
*  Similar to how phone networks facilitate calls, Swift facilitates the movement of money. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=53.0s)]
*  The infrastructure is what connects people together, right, to be able to talk to each [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=58.96s)]
*  other. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=64.48s)]
*  This is the same thing for banks. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=65.48s)]
*  It's simply instead of ideas and love and messages like that you're sending on the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=67.16s)]
*  phone, you're sending money. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=72.6s)]
*  Swift handles billions of financial messages each year. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=74.48s)]
*  And while there are other systems designed to circumvent Swift and challenge the dominance [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=77.68s)]
*  of the dollar, Swift is by far the most commonly used system around the world. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=81.62s)]
*  It connects more than 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=86.44s)]
*  Headquartered in Belgium, Swift is a member-owned cooperative. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=92.56s)]
*  Iran and North Korea are cut off from it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=95.96s)]
*  So how could Swift's sanctions impact Russia? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=99.36s)]
*  By cutting off some Russian banks from the system, the sanctions significantly hinder [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=102.68s)]
*  the movement of money into and out of Russia. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=106.6s)]
*  And that could lead to higher inflation and a weakening of the Russian ruble. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=109.6s)]
*  It's like you're putting a noose around the pipeline of money into and out of Russia. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=113.36s)]
*  Not only do the sanctions aim to cripple Moscow's ability to finance the Russian military, but [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=119.44s)]
*  they'll also affect every other aspect of the economy, trickling all the way down to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=124.16s)]
*  the ability of businesses and households to move money outside of the country. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=128.4s)]
*  The leverage is the leverage on the economy and the markets that puts political pressure [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=132.96s)]
*  internally on Putin to reverse course. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=138.38s)]
*  Swift is a global network, and experts say the sanctions could have an impact on countries [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=142.14s)]
*  around the world. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=146.7s)]
*  Foreign banks have about $121 billion in assets owed to them by Russian-based entities. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  So cutting Russian banks off from Swift could make it hard to collect that money. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=153.85999999999999s)]
*  And companies will undoubtedly face problems conducting trade with Russian counterparts, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=158.1s)]
*  paying Russian staff, or buying goods from Russia. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=162.42s)]
*  However, the West is planning, for now, to keep some Russian banks online for oil and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=165.66s)]
*  gas exports critical to the European and global economies. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=170.56s)]
*  You know, the willingness for the West, particularly Europe, to accept these economic sacrifices, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=174.72s)]
*  which are not small, right? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=183.6s)]
*  But what that reflects is the seriousness they take Russia's actions as a threat to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=185.56s)]
*  Western democracy, European democracy, post-war World II sort of agreements. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG1U-Qb38z0&t=192.84s)]
