# Why Trump Is Losing His Patience With Putin Over Ukraine | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E)
*  Trump has for a long time tried to be friendly and maybe even friends with Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=0.0s)]
*  I think I'd get along very well with Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=4.96s)]
*  I don't know Putin. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=8.56s)]
*  He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=9.6s)]
*  And Putin and I get along fine. We get along very well. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=13.36s)]
*  But in recent days, Trump hasn't been just mad with Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=17.84s)]
*  I was very disappointed with my call with President Putin. I was very disappointed. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=21.12s)]
*  We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin for you want to know the truth. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=26.159999999999997s)]
*  Here's how Trump's talk about Vladimir Putin and his actions towards Russia [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=30.0s)]
*  have changed dramatically over the years. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Do you like Vladimir Putin's comments about you? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=36.4s)]
*  Sure. When people call you brilliant, it's always good. Especially when the person heads up Russia. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=39.12s)]
*  Donald Trump used to be kind of an admirer of Vladimir Putin. Or if anything, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  he would say very nice things about the Russian president. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  The fact that you say you can get along with him. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=53.04s)]
*  I think I'll be able to get along with him. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=55.2s)]
*  Do you think the day that you become president of the United States, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=56.720000000000006s)]
*  he's going to change his mind on some of these key issues? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=59.2s)]
*  Possibly. It's possible. I don't know, Matt. It's possible. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  When Trump first joined the political scene, he was pretty open about wanting to revive relation [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=64.8s)]
*  with Russia. Russia had already invaded Ukraine in 2014. And there was a lot of discussion in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=69.84s)]
*  Washington about whether the US should increase the pressure on Moscow or if there should be a more [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  conciliatory measure. And that was Trump's whole MO during the 2016 election. Putin was not so [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=80.72s)]
*  much of a bad guy. Will I get along with him? I have no idea. He's a killer, though. Putin's a killer. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=86.56s)]
*  A lot of killers. We get a lot of killers. Why, you think our country's so innocent? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=93.12s)]
*  Well, Democrats use this moment to basically caricature Trump as some sort of Russian puppet. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=96.72s)]
*  From everything I see, has no respect for this person. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  But it became a kind of meme. We think you're the best candidate. Sure. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=111.44s)]
*  The smartest candidate. No doubt. The Manchurian candidate. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=116.08s)]
*  I don't know what that means, but it sounds tremendous. Putin leveraged Trump's sweet talk [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=119.68s)]
*  of Russia in order to flatter Trump. US intelligence shows, including US intelligence [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=124.72s)]
*  assessments during Trump's presidency, is that Russia did interfere in the election, or to at [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=129.76s)]
*  least harm Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016. Trump refuses to even admit that point, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=135.36s)]
*  because in his mind, it seems that to admit that would mean there's an asterisk on a 2016 election win. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=140.8s)]
*  I believe that President Putin really feels, and he feels strongly, that he did not [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  meddle in our election. What he believes is what he believes. What I believe is that we have to get to work. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  Trump was actually quite tough on Russia. There had been an increase of sanctions because of the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=160.24s)]
*  Ukraine war, and Trump even was the first president to send offensive weapons in order to fight Russia [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=164.64s)]
*  in its war. So there was already a seed in there where Trump did not like being called weak on Russia. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=171.04s)]
*  Trump's 2024 messaging on Russia was a little different, and Trump made this case that he could [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=177.44s)]
*  end the Russia-Ukraine war that had expanded dramatically during the Biden administration. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=183.11999999999998s)]
*  If I'm president, I will have that war settled in one day, 24 hours. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=188.16s)]
*  And it's been interesting to watch Trump in these first six months, because he has been able to get [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  a ceasefire in Gaza that did break, but he did also stop a growing fight between Pakistan and India. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  He also brokered a deal between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, but the one [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=204.8s)]
*  place he's still unable to make it happen is the one place he promised he could do quickly, and that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=209.68s)]
*  was the Russia-Ukraine war. You've now been in office for five months and five days. Why have [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  you not been able to end the Ukraine war? Because it's more difficult than people would have any idea. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=219.68s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has been more difficult. Trump keeps calling for a ceasefire and has even, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=227.6s)]
*  at one point, put on truth social, Vladimir, stop. Putin has only responded with more missiles and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=232.4s)]
*  more bombings of Ukraine, and that has clearly angered the president. I said, when are we going [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=237.44s)]
*  to end this, Vladimir? I've known him for a long time now. I said, when are we going to end this [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=243.68s)]
*  bloodshed, this bloodbath? It's a bloodbath. I was very unhappy with my call with President Putin, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=248.4s)]
*  and it just seems like he wants to go all the way and just keep killing people. What we're seeing [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=255.36s)]
*  now is Trump realizing that his efforts to end the war, that his own boast that he could end the war [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=262.48s)]
*  because he knew both Putin and Zelensky well from his first term, that those boasts aren't panning [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=268.24s)]
*  out. And it is a promise he has not yet fulfilled, and his anger is spilling out into public. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=273.76s)]
*  Does it portend some sort of radical policy shift where all of a sudden a Trump-led United States [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=287.2s)]
*  is going to pressure Russia in a way that it hasn't, that it's going to support Ukraine in a [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  way that Trump has not yet done so? It's hard to know, but for right now, in this moment, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=297.2s)]
*  Trump is as angry at Putin and at Russia that he's ever been. And that could make this quite [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=303.52s)]
*  the pivot point, not only for Trump's foreign policy, but for Trump's presidency. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eGsMBhT0E&t=308.79999999999995s)]
