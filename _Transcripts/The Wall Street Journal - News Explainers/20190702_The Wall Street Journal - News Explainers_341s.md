# What's Happening With Trump's Trade Fights? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 02, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0)
*  If you've taken a nap at any point in the last couple of months, there's a good chance [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=0.0s)]
*  you've missed at least one US threat to impose tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=4.0s)]
*  of US imports. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=9.1s)]
*  Tariffs are a beautiful thing. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=10.1s)]
*  It's a beautiful word. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=11.6s)]
*  We're going to put tariffs on. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=12.6s)]
*  And those tariffs, we're ready to go on Monday morning. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=13.6s)]
*  We always have the option to raise it another 300 billion. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=16.22s)]
*  As part of the president's efforts to rewrite the global rules of trade and rebalance our [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=19.36s)]
*  trading relationships, he's imposed tariffs on almost every country in the world over [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=23.34s)]
*  the past year and a half. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=27.52s)]
*  That includes our biggest trading partners, China, Canada, Mexico, and Europe. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=29.2s)]
*  Recently, a lot has been happening. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=33.8s)]
*  We're going to try to bring you up to speed. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=35.36s)]
*  So let's start with our biggest trading partner, China. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=37.32s)]
*  The US imported about $540 billion of goods from China last year and exported about $120 [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=40.92s)]
*  billion, making it the biggest trading relationship of any two countries in the world. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  One of President Trump's big goals is to balance this relationship out. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=52.0s)]
*  Last summer, he slapped 25% tariffs on goods like machinery, commodities, semiconductors, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=55.92s)]
*  and plastics. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=60.56s)]
*  China retaliated, mostly on vehicles and agricultural products, especially soybeans. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=61.56s)]
*  The US hit back in the fall, this time with 10% tariffs on an additional $200 billion [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=66.92s)]
*  worth of products, furniture, handbags, luggage, and many computer and auto parts. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=71.6s)]
*  China once again retaliated. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=76.92s)]
*  In December, the US and China called a truce, but it didn't last. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=79.04s)]
*  The talks broke down in May, and the US moved forward with plans to raise those 10% tariffs [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=83.06s)]
*  to 25%. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=87.7s)]
*  China retaliated, and then the US threatened to impose tariffs on everything else that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=89.46000000000001s)]
*  comes in from China, an additional $300 billion of goods. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=93.9s)]
*  So where do things stand now? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=98.7s)]
*  President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping held a summit on June 29th, where [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=100.5s)]
*  they reached a truce for now. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=104.1s)]
*  We're going to work with China on where we left off to see if we can make a deal. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=105.78s)]
*  The US will hold off on its final round of tariffs, but all the original rounds of tariffs [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=113.46000000000001s)]
*  will still remain. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=117.9s)]
*  And if they can't get a deal, it's likely we'll be talking about tariffs again soon. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=119.26s)]
*  But the trade tensions haven't just been with China. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=123.66s)]
*  Canada and Mexico have also been in the US crosshairs. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=126.5s)]
*  I have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  About $600 billion a year worth of trade flows between Canada and between Mexico and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=135.22s)]
*  the United States each year. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=142.74s)]
*  One of President Trump's big campaign goals was to rewrite the 25-year-old North American [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=144.66s)]
*  Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=148.74s)]
*  The talks started in 2017. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=150.82s)]
*  But last year, when they weren't making progress quickly enough, President Trump imposed tariffs [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=153.06s)]
*  on steel and aluminum imports from everyone in the world, including Mexico and Canada. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=157.3s)]
*  And to further up the pressure, he threatened tariffs on the entire global automobile industry. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=161.7s)]
*  About $372 billion worth of imports. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=166.82s)]
*  Last summer, the three countries finally reached a new deal, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=170.14s)]
*  Called USMCA. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=174.82s)]
*  It sort of just works. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=175.82s)]
*  MCA. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=178.26s)]
*  But the deal doesn't go into effect until all three countries have ratified it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=179.26s)]
*  So far, only Mexico has done so. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=184.1s)]
*  To ease the road to getting it passed, the US did two things. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=186.54s)]
*  First, it dropped the threat of auto tariffs against Canada and Mexico. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=189.3s)]
*  And second, in May, it finally removed the tariffs against steel and aluminum. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=193.06s)]
*  And Mexico and Canada removed their tariffs, too. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=197.10000000000002s)]
*  But then things got complicated. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=200.06s)]
*  Mexico shouldn't allow millions of people to try and enter our country. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=202.18s)]
*  And they could stop it very quickly. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  And I think they will. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=208.46s)]
*  And if they won't, we're going to put tariffs on it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=209.46s)]
*  President Trump, citing too many migrants arriving at the US-Mexico border, threatened [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=212.10000000000002s)]
*  tariffs on everything the US imports from Mexico. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=216.86s)]
*  About $350 billion a year of goods. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=220.46s)]
*  Those tariffs go from 5% to 10% to 15% to 20% and then to 25%. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=223.22000000000003s)]
*  Mexico rushed a delegation to DC, pledged to do more at its own southern border to stop [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=229.18s)]
*  the flow of migrants, and avoided the threat of tariffs for now. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=234.10000000000002s)]
*  But President Trump has made it clear that the threat remains and will be revisited within [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=238.0s)]
*  90 days. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=241.86s)]
*  When it comes to trading relationships, there's an even bigger one that's still unsettled. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=242.86s)]
*  We're talking about Europe. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=248.02s)]
*  If you look at the European Union, it's very solidly against us in terms of trade. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=249.5s)]
*  The European Union sets trade policies for all its member countries. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=255.88000000000002s)]
*  So collectively, the US imports about $500 billion a year of goods from the EU and exports [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=259.78000000000003s)]
*  about $320 billion, making US-EU trade the biggest trading relationship in the world. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=265.94s)]
*  Remember those steel and aluminum tariffs? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=272.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=274.3s)]
*  They still apply to Europe. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=275.3s)]
*  And there's a couple big threats still hanging out there. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=276.3s)]
*  First, autos. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=279.18s)]
*  They send the Mercedes, they send BMWs, they send everything. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  We tax them practically nothing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=285.26000000000005s)]
*  We can't send our cars. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=287.26000000000005s)]
*  The US imports a lot of cars from Europe. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  For now, the Trump administration has postponed the threat of auto tariffs until November, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=291.34000000000003s)]
*  but not removed it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=295.38000000000005s)]
*  There's also a threat of tariffs because of a long-running dispute between Airbus and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=296.38000000000005s)]
*  Boeing. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=300.3s)]
*  The EU and US have each threatened $11 billion of tariffs because of this. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=301.3s)]
*  Negotiators here aren't making any progress, and the Europeans are getting worried. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=305.58s)]
*  President Trump has already shown he's willing to threaten tariffs against everything the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=310.1s)]
*  US imports from China and everything the US imports from Mexico. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=313.90000000000003s)]
*  Put it all together, and there's over $2.5 trillion of trade hanging in the balance. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=318.46000000000004s)]
*  So far, the Trump administration hasn't gotten any major trade deals across the line. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=324.26s)]
*  And so the worry is that they could keep adding tariffs. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=329.1s)]
*  A billion dollars here and a billion dollars there, and pretty soon you're talking about [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=332.46000000000004s)]
*  real money. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8VqxwJYTu0&t=337.18s)]
