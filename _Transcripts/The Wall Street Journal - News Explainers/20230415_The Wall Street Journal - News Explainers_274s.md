*  Turn on the AP. Take off. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=12.8s)]
*  This spacecraft is embarking on an eight-year journey [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=14.8s)]
*  to study Jupiter and three of its largest moons. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=17.48s)]
*  The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, also known as JUS, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=20.56s)]
*  is on a mission to characterize what makes a world habitable [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=23.68s)]
*  so it can sustain life in our solar system. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=26.84s)]
*  Are we really so special in the cosmos that Earth is the only place [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=29.96s)]
*  that can support life forms? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=34.36s)]
*  Here's a look at what JUS will explore once it arrives at its destination [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=36.24s)]
*  and what it might reveal about the search for life in outer space. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=39.84s)]
*  The JUS mission is led by the European Space Agency, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=44.36s)]
*  partnering with other space agencies across the world, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  including those in the US, Japan, and Israel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=50.32s)]
*  On board, the spacecraft carries a suite of 10 scientific instruments, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=53.8s)]
*  making it the most powerful payload flown to the outer solar system. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=58.04s)]
*  Those instruments include a camera system, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=62.28s)]
*  they include a radar system that can penetrate several miles into the surface. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=64.6s)]
*  They're bringing a laser altimeter, which will sort of help them create a 3D map. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=68.96s)]
*  Any spacecraft headed into outer space will face challenges, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=73.32s)]
*  from navigating the asteroid belt to a long roundabout journey. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=76.88s)]
*  But JUS was designed to withstand some of the universe's extremes, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=80.56s)]
*  including radiation and harsh temperatures. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=84.28s)]
*  On its journey, JUS will encounter nearly 500 degree temperatures around Venus [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  and close to minus 400 degree temperatures near Jupiter. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=91.6s)]
*  When they build these instruments, they not only need to ensure that they can [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=94.72s)]
*  deliver on the science that's proposed, like they're sensitive enough [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=98.56s)]
*  and calibrated enough to identify differences in magnetic fields and things, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=102.08s)]
*  but also need to survive the journey, right? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=105.72s)]
*  You can't send the plumber to go fix the instruments. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=108.12s)]
*  JUS, which weighs about 10 tons, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=110.76s)]
*  must first complete flybys of Earth, the Moon, and Venus, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=112.8s)]
*  so it can adjust its trajectory and gain enough speed. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=116.52s)]
*  It was challenging to design the spacecraft because it has to take [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  such a sort of long journey to get to Jupiter. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  By the time JUS reaches its destination in July of 2031, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=126.56s)]
*  the spacecraft will have traveled nearly 4 billion miles. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=130.16s)]
*  Sitting nearly 450 million miles away from Earth, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=134.32s)]
*  Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=137.6s)]
*  more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  One of the NASA scientists described Jupiter's planetary neighborhood [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  as sort of like the Disneyland, Universal, and Six Flags of the solar system [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=147.44s)]
*  all rolled into one. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=151.72s)]
*  The planet is mostly composed of gases like hydrogen and helium [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=152.92s)]
*  and has a powerful magnetic field that affects thousands of objects in its orbit. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  JUS will in part study this atmosphere to understand how the harsh environment [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=161.44s)]
*  shapes the conditions on its surrounding moons. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=165.76s)]
*  Among nearly 100 moons orbiting Jupiter, three of the largest, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=168.64s)]
*  Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, are all thought to possibly harbor oceans [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=172.32s)]
*  of liquid water beneath their icy crusts after previous missions [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=176.84s)]
*  shed light on what lies beneath the surface. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=180.56s)]
*  JUS's radar instrument will sort of help scientists peer under the surface. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=183.28s)]
*  It might help them understand how thick the ice is above what is potentially [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=187.4s)]
*  a subsurface ocean. It might also help reveal whether or not this ocean is salty. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=191.72s)]
*  Scientists will look for liquid water, a heat source, and organic materials [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  which are among the ingredients needed to sustain life. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=201.96s)]
*  It's likely going to be microbes. We're not looking at aliens living under the ocean surface. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=205.28s)]
*  It could also be maybe more advanced species sort of similar to what we might find [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=209.72s)]
*  near deep sea vents in our own oceans on Earth. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=213.76s)]
*  While JUS can't detect life, the mission is a step toward identifying [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=217.52s)]
*  whether these ingredients exist elsewhere in our solar system. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=221.12s)]
*  The JUS mission is expected to collect about four years of data before ending in 2035. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=225.68s)]
*  But it's not the only spacecraft observing Jupiter and its surrounding moons. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=231.28s)]
*  NASA is also sending a mission to Europa next year named Europa Clipper. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=236.12s)]
*  That mission will arrive in 2030 and will observe the moon at the same time as JUS. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  Space science has matured over the past couple of decades and really honed in on [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  Jupiter and to look for those other life forms. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=249.95999999999998s)]
*  And JUS is a key requisite to really making that objective a reality. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=253.04s)]
*  There's no promise that we'll detect life on these moons. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=258.84s)]
*  But if we don't look and see whether or not they're potentially habitable, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=263.44s)]
*  we won't actually ever get the answer. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWpYQ6NYRIU&t=267.4s)]
