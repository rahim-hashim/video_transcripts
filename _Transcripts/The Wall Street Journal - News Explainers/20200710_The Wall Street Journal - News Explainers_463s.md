# Why The Coronavirus May Forever Change Grocery Shopping | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 10, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A)
*  Few industries have been as impacted by the coronavirus as the grocery business. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=0.0s)]
*  When lockdowns began, grocery stores transformed themselves physically to respond to safety [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=8.08s)]
*  concerns. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  At the same time, demand skyrocketed, pushing food retail sales to record highs and in many [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=14.88s)]
*  cases remaking entire supply chains. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=20.92s)]
*  I've been in this business since I was a child. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=23.44s)]
*  COVID-19 was something we've never seen before. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=26.28s)]
*  Everybody has been affected and I think the industry will be remade in the future as a result. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=29.92s)]
*  The pandemic has triggered a boom in online shopping. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=36.72s)]
*  Instacart, the nation's biggest independent grocery delivery service, reported that its [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=40.0s)]
*  order volumes are up as much as 500% year over year. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  So what happens next? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  What will be the lasting legacy of COVID-19 for the food retail industry and its workers? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Simply put, how will we shop in the near future? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=57.8s)]
*  Plastic shields, masks, social distancing markers. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=63.32s)]
*  If you've visited a grocery store any time in the past few months, you've almost certainly [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=67.64s)]
*  encountered these new cosmetic changes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=72.32s)]
*  But what about consumer behavior? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=75.84s)]
*  Are we shopping differently? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=78.28s)]
*  To find out, I spoke with Bill Bishop, a veteran industry analyst. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=83.4s)]
*  Consumers are first of all going to the store less frequently. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  They are rushing through the shopping experience more quickly than normal. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=93.48s)]
*  Browsing is not fashionable. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=98.56s)]
*  During the pandemic, people definitely started buying different things. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  Kelvin Rodriguez operates an independent family-run grocery store, Billy's Marketplace, in Ridgewood, Queens. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  Number one was paper, paper products, a lot of non-perishables, and they were buying more bulk. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=112.84s)]
*  Before the pandemic, local independent stores like Billy's Marketplace made up only about [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=119.76s)]
*  11% of all grocery sales. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=125.64s)]
*  Most Americans shop at the nation's biggest chains, like Walmart, Amazon Whole Foods, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=129.16s)]
*  or Kroger. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=134.2s)]
*  The retail grocery business is a huge business, made up of many competitors, which makes it [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=135.8s)]
*  a hyper competitive, very low margin business. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  Before the pandemic, grocery stores in the inner city, I would say were struggling a bit. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  There was a lot of competition. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  There was a lot of big box stores coming into New York. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=152.84s)]
*  To cater to the tastes of his mostly millennial customers, Rodriguez set up a beer bar and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=156.67999999999998s)]
*  a coffee shop in the store. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  We wanted to create an experience, and that's where we thought this industry was headed. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=163.92s)]
*  We wanted to create where you could almost get everything in one. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=169.64s)]
*  We know everyone that's walking in through that door, and we have a relationship with our customers. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  But with New York still on partial lockdown, those offerings are simply not possible because [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=178.27999999999997s)]
*  of safety regulations. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=183.11999999999998s)]
*  Fortunately, late last year, Rodriguez had the foresight to jump on the biggest trend [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=185.16s)]
*  in food retail, e-commerce. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  Usually we don't know the difference between an instacart shopper and a regular shopper. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  With such low margins, it's impractical for smaller operations to create their own delivery services. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=198.36s)]
*  Instead, if independent stores like Billy's want to sell online, they have to look to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  third-party companies like Shopify or Instacart. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=209.4s)]
*  Previous to the pandemic, it was about 1%, which you would say 1% is pretty small. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=213.32000000000002s)]
*  After the pandemic, it doubled. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  It went to 2%. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=220.4s)]
*  Although a 1% increase may not sound like much, in an industry with such low margins, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=221.84s)]
*  1% can be the difference between being profitable or simply breaking even. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=227.68s)]
*  Before the pandemic, online grocery shopping was a small fraction of all grocery shopping. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=246.72s)]
*  But since then, it has gone mainstream. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=252.4s)]
*  The largest player in grocery would be Walmart. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=254.8s)]
*  Walmart has approximately 5,000 U.S. stores, which can be found 10 miles from 90% of the U.S. population. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=259.0s)]
*  We've been focused in this space for a while now, building up our curbside pickup capabilities [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=266.44s)]
*  that are in over 3,300 of our locations as we stand today and growing each week. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=273.04s)]
*  According to Ward, although the trend toward online shopping has existed for a while now, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=279.76000000000005s)]
*  the coronavirus accelerated its adoption. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  We heard that customers felt more comfortable if they didn't have to have a personal exchange. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=287.64000000000004s)]
*  All of our curbside interactions now are contactless. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  In fact, our customers don't even wind their window down. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=296.56s)]
*  The transaction is conducted inside the vehicle. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=300.16s)]
*  Our associates load the trunk on the customer's behalf. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=303.52000000000004s)]
*  More than 38.6 million Americans have filed for unemployment since March, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=307.4s)]
*  creating a new talent pool for those expanded operations. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  One area of growth has been in non-traditional gig work. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  Instacart, for example, relies on gig workers to shop for its customers. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=320.23999999999995s)]
*  But like many industries that rely on gig workers, the sustainability of this delivery model [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=324.96s)]
*  depends heavily on the workers' compensation and whether they are classified as employees. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=330.03999999999996s)]
*  The long-term benefits for retailers with an online presence [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=336.24s)]
*  lies in the data they can collect about their customers. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=339.76s)]
*  If a retailer has your business online and offline, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=343.0s)]
*  it gives you a complete picture of the household or a much more complete picture, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=347.88s)]
*  which is very valuable. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=352.04s)]
*  The growth of e-commerce has also given rise to dark stores, the name of which can be misleading. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=354.6s)]
*  Dark stores aren't really stores in a traditional sense because they're not open to customers. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  They're more like depots that serve primarily as a location for pickup or dispersed delivery. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=366.04s)]
*  It's particularly important because it's a route to profitability. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  The cost of picking the order, so we call pick and pack, substantially less in a dark store. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=376.32s)]
*  Looking further into the future, a sign of things to come could be online-only companies like Okado. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=384.20000000000005s)]
*  Based in the UK, Okado only does home deliveries from its warehouses. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=390.52000000000004s)]
*  Okado is a standalone online service that is generally regarded as the absolute state of the art. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=395.56s)]
*  If a typical supermarket is 50,000 square feet, an Okado unit is 350,000 square feet, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=404.84s)]
*  and it reaches tremendous efficiencies. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=413.2s)]
*  Back in Queens, Rodriguez remains confident that once the pandemic passes, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=426.52s)]
*  his customers will still want the neighborhood in-store experience that Billy's offers. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=432.0s)]
*  I'm really trying to get people here. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=437.28s)]
*  I feel like if everything goes online, what kind of experience are you really going to have? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=438.79999999999995s)]
*  You've got to get out of the house sometime. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=443.24s)]
*  So it's almost to make people feel at home. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=445.08s)]
*  That's really what we wanted to do, make people feel at home at the store. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f73QTQQd7A&t=447.56s)]
