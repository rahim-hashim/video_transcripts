# How Boeing’s 737 Max Is Causing Turbulence in the Industry | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 25, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk)
*  Sales of the previously high-flying Boeing 737 are slumping amid the crisis surrounding [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=0.0s)]
*  the newest version, the MAX. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=7.16s)]
*  Boeing this year has booked only 36 737 orders and none in the past three months. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=9.76s)]
*  Last year, at the mid-year point, the company had secured 296 orders for its best-selling [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=15.34s)]
*  plane. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=21.28s)]
*  Boeing did get a boost in June when British Airways parent IAG said it would buy 200 MAX [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=22.6s)]
*  planes, though the deal still needs to be finalized. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=28.32s)]
*  On top of the sales slump, Boeing has more than 100 new MAX jets sitting undelivered [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  at its facilities near Seattle because the fleet has been grounded since March. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=36.0s)]
*  More than 300 additional MAX planes already with airlines have also been idled by the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=40.88s)]
*  global grounding. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=45.44s)]
*  That's caused huge disruptions across the aviation landscape. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  The crisis began last October when a new MAX jet crashed on a flight out of Indonesia. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  It was the first crash of a MAX. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=56.52s)]
*  Less than five months later, another 737 MAX crashed in Ethiopia. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  A total of 346 passengers and crew died aboard those two flights. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=63.96s)]
*  The similarities between the crashes sparked safety concerns among regulators and prompted [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=69.34s)]
*  a global grounding of the MAX fleet. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=74.0s)]
*  The impact has reached far beyond the countries where the planes went down or Boeing's manufacturing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=77.04s)]
*  hub in Seattle. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=82.0s)]
*  For example, take Southwest Airlines, the biggest buyer of MAX planes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=83.86s)]
*  For now, the airline has struck the model from flight schedules through October 1st. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=88.5s)]
*  The budget airline had received 31 MAX planes at the time the fleet was grounded. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=93.88s)]
*  More were due for delivery over the summer. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=98.86s)]
*  In response, Southwest has had to cancel flights and juggle schedules. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=101.2s)]
*  United, American and Air Canada are among the other North American carriers to be hit. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  Iceland has also had to cancel more than 100 flights per day because of the MAX grounding. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=112.3s)]
*  Air Canada has rented planes from others, including Lufthansa and Qatar Airways, to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=117.06s)]
*  make up for the shortage of seats with the MAX idled. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=121.38s)]
*  And Icelandair has now struck the plane from its schedule through October. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=124.3s)]
*  Passengers who were scheduled to fly aboard Boeing's MAX fleet also remain rattled. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=129.01999999999998s)]
*  Alexander Dejuniak, the director general of the world's biggest airline association, said [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=133.46s)]
*  as much in early June. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=138.32s)]
*  But the consequences of these strategies go far beyond the technical. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=139.8s)]
*  Trust in the certification system has been damaged, among regulators, between regulators [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=145.4s)]
*  and the industry, and with the flying public. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=151.44s)]
*  Other airlines around the world that also rely on the MAX are scrambling as well. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=155.4s)]
*  Many operators told Boeing they expect to be compensated for losses from the grounding. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=160.72000000000003s)]
*  I set out the case of European travel company TUI, one of Europe's biggest MAX operators. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=166.14000000000001s)]
*  It estimates an earnings hit of more than $330 million this year alone. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=171.70000000000002s)]
*  That bill covers the need to cancel some flights and the need to rent replacement aircraft [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=177.58s)]
*  at high cost to get customers to their vacation hotspots. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=182.26000000000002s)]
*  Those involved in making the MAX also are being impacted. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=187.3s)]
*  Boeing in April said it would keep building 737s, though at a slower pace, rather than [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=190.78s)]
*  cranking out 52 737s a month, the company announced it would build only 42 a month. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=195.7s)]
*  Boeing's vast MAX supply chain also is grappling with the turmoil. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=202.32s)]
*  Spirit Aerosystems said some of its employees have been put on shorter work weeks, reducing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=207.0s)]
*  their pay. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=211.72s)]
*  Investors haven't been immune either. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=213.78s)]
*  After delivering a record number of planes in 2018, Boeing shares reached a record high [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=215.92s)]
*  early this year. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=220.39999999999998s)]
*  But since then, the aerospace giant's stock has slumped. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  Also seeing their investments fall are Spirit Aerosystems shareholders. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=225.48s)]
*  The stock has declined about 25% since March. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  Earlier this year, Boeing was hoping to get the MAX fixed quickly, but new concerns with [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=233.85999999999999s)]
*  the plane's systems have led to delays. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=237.94s)]
*  For example, in June, an FAA pilot found a new potential problem with the 737 MAX's flight [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=240.44s)]
*  control system. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  Boeing now says it won't submit its MAX fix to the FAA until September. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=248.7s)]
*  The FAA and other regulators have not said when they, in turn, may clear the plane to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=253.9s)]
*  resume carrying passengers. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=258.78000000000003s)]
*  Until that happens, Boeing and its partners will have to deal with the massive hole left [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=261.42s)]
*  by the beleaguered 737 MAX. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0hb9zKAoQk&t=265.98s)]
