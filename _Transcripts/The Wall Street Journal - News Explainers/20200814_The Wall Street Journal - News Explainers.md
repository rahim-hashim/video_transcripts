# High-Stakes Arctic Race Heats Up for U.S., Russia and China  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 14, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc)
*  This map shows the amount of ice around the North Pole decreasing rapidly over the years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=0.0s)]
*  And as the sea ice steadily melts in the Arctic, the U.S., China and Russia are stepping up their game in the remote and inhospitable region [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=5.8s)]
*  that's rich in resources and growing in strategic importance. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=13.76s)]
*  The Arctic is the most important region. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=17.48s)]
*  There are other people coming into the Arctic and we don't like it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=19.96s)]
*  China is a close-knit country. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=22.96s)]
*  It's an untapped area of mineral resources that China would like to explore one day. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=25.439999999999998s)]
*  Russia has moved quite quickly in the last few years to really boost its military presence in the Arctic. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=30.16s)]
*  Greenland allows for trans-navigation from Europe to the United States. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=36.04s)]
*  It provides a place where you can refuel ships, refuel planes, have storage bases. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  An estimated trillion dollars' worth of rare earth metals could be lying under all that ice, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=45.84s)]
*  as well as about 30% of the world's undiscovered gas and 13% of the world's undiscovered oil. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=50.72s)]
*  The warmer Arctic is also extending the season when ships can navigate in these usually ice-covered waters, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  potentially reducing navigation time between Shanghai and New York by as much as seven days [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=63.32s)]
*  and making tourism and cargo shipment more attractive. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=68.52s)]
*  All this is setting the stage for potential clashes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=72.88s)]
*  Almost 10% of Russia's GDP and 20% of its exports come from north of the Arctic Circle, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=77.92s)]
*  and Moscow says it's ready to defend its territory. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=83.96s)]
*  The military infrastructure has really been successfully increased in the last several years. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=87.0s)]
*  One of Russia's most northern banks can now handle jet fighters, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  and that's a huge jump from where it was a couple of years ago. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=97.56s)]
*  And this activity hasn't gone unnoticed in Washington. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  Russia is unique. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=103.28s)]
*  Its actions deserve special attention. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  Any signs that Russia is trying to reclaim its status as a great power on the global stage, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=106.92s)]
*  and especially in a place like the Arctic, which has disputes, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=114.68s)]
*  it's a cause for worry in Washington, I think largely because of that lack of trust. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=117.76s)]
*  Russia is also investing to renovate old Soviet ports along its northern sea route. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=121.72s)]
*  Cargo shipments, mainly of energy resources, are steadily growing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  But with little infrastructure and given the still limited period of time between July and November [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=130.64s)]
*  that the route in the Arctic is open, there is still a long way before it becomes a real rival [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=135.48s)]
*  to traditional shipping routes like via the Suez Canal. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=140.24s)]
*  Right now there's a relatively large gap between what Russia wants to accomplish in the Arctic [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=143.8s)]
*  and what it is actually doing. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=147.6s)]
*  One of the biggest problems right now is infrastructure. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=148.8s)]
*  So it wants to attract international investors, and that includes China. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=151.12s)]
*  We are considering the possibility of building this northern sea route and the Chinese sea Silk Road. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=156.24s)]
*  In 2018, China declared itself a near-Arctic state, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=163.24s)]
*  even though the northernmost part of China is more than 900 miles away from the Arctic Circle. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  Basically, China plans to carve out shipping routes and tap natural resources. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=172.28s)]
*  When China announced its polar strategy, Russia at least verbally welcomed it, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=176.52s)]
*  but there are still a lot of reservations. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=181.52s)]
*  Western capital and technology in the country dried up following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=186.28s)]
*  So Moscow has accepted billions of dollars from Beijing in loans and investments, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=192.88s)]
*  including for the landmark gas project on the Yamal Peninsula. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=197.32s)]
*  But China's investments are mostly limited to projects that can help it exploit resources. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=200.96s)]
*  China doesn't want to just invest for the sake of investing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=205.6s)]
*  It wants to actually see a profit come from that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=208.76s)]
*  There's another sticking point between Russia and China and the Arctic. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=213.04s)]
*  Russia would want its own icebreakers to accompany commercial vessels. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  China, on the other hand, would like freedom of navigation [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=220.64s)]
*  and where China wouldn't need to rely on Russian exports. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  And so that's the fundamental disagreement. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=227.6s)]
*  Essentially, it's a large real estate deal. A lot of things could be done. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=230.48s)]
*  Most of the world woke up to the U.S. interest in the Arctic when President Trump [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  floated the idea of buying Greenland, the biggest island in the region, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=239.36s)]
*  and which is the site of America's northernmost military base. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=243.52s)]
*  Denmark, which exercises control over Greenland, turned down the idea. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=247.08s)]
*  So after a decades-long hiatus, the U.S. reopened its consulate in Greenland's capital in June. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=251.52s)]
*  During an interview with the Danish Broadcasting Corporation, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=257.08000000000004s)]
*  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo admitted that the U.S. is playing catch-up. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=260.12s)]
*  Are you a bit late to the party in the Arctic? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=264.44s)]
*  Yep, we're a little late. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=266.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=267.92s)]
*  That's all right. I've been late to parties before and had a great time. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  We'll succeed. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=270.88s)]
*  The United States, for instance, has a presence in the Arctic with a newly launched Navy fleet. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=273.04s)]
*  That's just a continuation of making sure that other great powers know that the U.S. isn't losing a step [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=278.16s)]
*  and is able to fight in extreme cold weather battlefields. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=285.36s)]
*  We've all been a little bit naive to watch not only the Russians, but the Chinese interests there [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=289.0s)]
*  continue to become more and more aggressive. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  China and Russia insist that they support peaceful economic and scientific cooperation in the region. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=296.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, Washington is trying to build up its fleet of icebreakers. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=302.68s)]
*  We have under construction right now the largest icebreaker in the world. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=306.8s)]
*  And we're going to be trying to get, if we can, an extra 10 icebreakers. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=312.4s)]
*  At the moment, the U.S. has only one old heavy icebreaker in operation, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=317.2s)]
*  compared with Russia's some 40 vessels, including nuclear ones that can smash through ice nine feet thick. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  China has two icebreakers as well, and it's building a nuclear one. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=327.96s)]
*  Icebreakers do a number of things for a country that has them. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=331.47999999999996s)]
*  One, it keeps open commercial ice channels and allows for the rescue of vessels. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=334.64s)]
*  If the U.S. is unable to send up a rescue team, other great powers like Russia and even China can go up there, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=340.23999999999995s)]
*  save people, then they'll have a better claim to be able to stay in the Arctic. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=347.03999999999996s)]
*  For the U.S., China and Russia, it's a pivotal moment in the Arctic. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=350.72s)]
*  The moves they make today are likely to define the region for years to come [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=354.64s)]
*  and potentially help reshape global supply chains and energy markets. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjp5ONYM_jc&t=358.68s)]
