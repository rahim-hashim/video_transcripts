# USPS's Financial Crisis, Explained  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90)
*  The post office is in trouble. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=0.0s)]
*  It's lost money for 13 years straight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=2.44s)]
*  Putting it in, what experts say [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=5.16s)]
*  is a dire financial situation. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=6.9s)]
*  That's bad news for a service that delivers everything [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=9.28s)]
*  from medication to social security checks. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=12.16s)]
*  If you wanna know the reason for this, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=15.32s)]
*  just take a look at a first-class postage stamp. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=16.88s)]
*  It guarantees mail delivery anywhere in the United States, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  even to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=23.52s)]
*  And to cover the cost of the trip, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=25.96s)]
*  the post office charges a flat rate of 55 cents. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=27.88s)]
*  These two things, mail that's universal and affordable, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=31.6s)]
*  make up the mission of the post office. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=34.56s)]
*  The service is back in the news [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=37.32s)]
*  as part of an ongoing political debate. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=38.88s)]
*  But problems started years before, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  as the goals of the post office came into conflict, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=43.76s)]
*  creating a financial situation that has raised questions [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=46.68s)]
*  about what the USPS should do [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=49.8s)]
*  and how far mail should be expected to go. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  The modern postal service we know today emerged in 1970. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=58.84s)]
*  That year, 152,000 postal workers walked off the job [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  to protest pay and working conditions [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=67.72s)]
*  halting much of the nation's mail. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=70.04s)]
*  President Nixon declared a national emergency [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=72.36s)]
*  and called in federal troops to sort the backlog. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=74.88s)]
*  I have just now directed the activation [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=78.48s)]
*  of the men of the various military organizations [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=81.56s)]
*  to begin in New York City. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=84.92s)]
*  The restoration of essential mail services. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=87.36s)]
*  Part of the reason for the postal crisis [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=91.56s)]
*  was that Congress held the purse strings. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=93.52s)]
*  At the time, the post office was a cabinet level agency [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=96.32s)]
*  and almost 25% of postal revenue [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=99.36s)]
*  came through congressional appropriations. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=101.84s)]
*  And all important decisions from wages [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=104.28s)]
*  to setting postage rates were made by Congress. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=106.96s)]
*  This led to artificially low postage rates, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=110.16s)]
*  which were popular, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=112.56s)]
*  but also created a stagnant postal infrastructure. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=113.92s)]
*  David Trimble of the Government Accountability Office [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  said oversight for the post office [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  was similar to other government agencies. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=121.92s)]
*  The post office was actually part of the federal government. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=124.6s)]
*  It was a department. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  And as a department, Congress played a much more active role [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  in a lot of operational decisions. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=134.64s)]
*  Kevin Kozar from the right-leaning [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=137.64s)]
*  American Enterprise Institute [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=139.48s)]
*  said it made running a nationwide logistical system difficult. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=141.52s)]
*  You had all these conflicting demands [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=145.56s)]
*  that flowed through the public, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=148.52s)]
*  through the representatives, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=150.88s)]
*  and into the post office department. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  To deal with these issues, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  Congress decided to let the government agency [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=156.08s)]
*  run itself more like a business. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=158.52s)]
*  In 1970, it passed the Postal Reorganization Act, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  which gave the agency more independence [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=164.8s)]
*  in managing its operations. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=167.08s)]
*  But independence came with a catch. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=169.48s)]
*  The post office had to pay for everything itself, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=171.72s)]
*  from operations to employee benefits. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=174.64s)]
*  Congress doesn't pay for any of its regular operations, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=177.44s)]
*  nor does it have any say over postage rates. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=181.0s)]
*  You sort of have this organization that's created [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=184.04s)]
*  that's got sort of competing pressures on it, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  having a sort of a public role or public service mission [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=191.64s)]
*  of serving every community, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  while at the same time operating in a business-like fashion [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=196.92s)]
*  so that their operations financed all of their costs. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=201.48s)]
*  The USPS benefits from not having any competition [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=205.88s)]
*  in delivering mail to American mailboxes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=209.27999999999997s)]
*  By law, it operates a monopoly over what has come to be known [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=212.32s)]
*  as market-dominant products. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=215.83999999999997s)]
*  The letterbox in front of your home [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=218.2s)]
*  or in the lobby of your apartment building, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  nobody else is allowed to get into that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=222.76s)]
*  other than the postal service. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=224.76s)]
*  This covers categories like first-class mail, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=226.96s)]
*  marketing mail, and periodicals, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=229.44s)]
*  which make up the majority of its revenues. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=231.64s)]
*  Other services like package delivery [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=234.4s)]
*  are open to competition from companies like FedEx and UPS. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=236.48s)]
*  This new postal business model worked [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=241.0s)]
*  because mail volumes kept increasing [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=243.12s)]
*  through the 20th century. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=245.36s)]
*  The postal service benefits from having economies of scale. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=247.24s)]
*  The more mail it processes, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=251.12s)]
*  the less it costs to deliver each letter. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=252.64s)]
*  This is crucial for a business infrastructure [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=255.39999999999998s)]
*  that is expected to deliver mail across the United States. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=257.88s)]
*  The USPS has built out this infrastructure [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  to fulfill its universal service obligation, or USO. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=264.24s)]
*  This is a collection of laws, practices, and expectations [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=269.4s)]
*  for how the post office should serve every American. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=272.76s)]
*  The specifics of the USO are vague, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=275.76s)]
*  but generally it has come to mean [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=278.24s)]
*  affordable six-day-a-week mail delivery, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=279.92s)]
*  regardless of distance or mail volume. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=282.84s)]
*  Over the years, the post office has tackled mail delivery [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=285.48s)]
*  in a variety of ways, using pneumatic tubes, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=288.24s)]
*  sleds, and segues. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=291.56s)]
*  Even today, there are postal routes [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=293.96s)]
*  where mail is delivered entirely by boat. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=295.56s)]
*  Postal service is often trying to do [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=298.08s)]
*  a lot of different things at the same time, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=300.2s)]
*  which is tough. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  And it started getting tougher in the 21st century. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=306.04s)]
*  The internet offered a much quicker way to communicate, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=309.08s)]
*  and in 2001, mail volumes began to decline. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=311.8s)]
*  These declines prompted Congress to pass [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=315.96s)]
*  another set of consequential reforms in 2006. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=318.2s)]
*  The Postal Enhancement and Accountability Act [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=321.76s)]
*  was intended to streamline the rate-setting process [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=324.28s)]
*  by allowing price flexibility [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=327.52s)]
*  on competitive products like packages, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=329.24s)]
*  while at the same time putting a price cap [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=331.68s)]
*  on first-class mail that was tied to inflation. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=333.88s)]
*  It was meant to help the post office, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=336.92s)]
*  but it did the opposite. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=339.16s)]
*  A short time after it was enacted, about 12 months, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=341.56s)]
*  the United States slid into a recession. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=344.88s)]
*  Mail volumes and revenue started to plunge, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=347.08000000000004s)]
*  and the Postal Service struggled to find the money [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=349.88s)]
*  to put in the Retiree Health Benefits Fund. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=353.04s)]
*  The Retiree Health Benefits Fund [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=355.44s)]
*  was another requirement in the law [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  that mandated the Postal Service pre-fund health benefits [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=359.72s)]
*  to the tune of over $5 billion per year. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=363.16s)]
*  All the while, the post office was expected [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=366.36s)]
*  to maintain universal service [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=368.48s)]
*  to approximately one million new addresses per year, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=370.04s)]
*  a tall order when postage rates [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  couldn't be raised beyond the inflation cap. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=375.12s)]
*  And while package volumes were growing, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=377.76s)]
*  they weren't enough to cover the losses [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=380.12s)]

*  The agency began defaulting [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=384.56s)]
*  on its healthcare payments in 2012, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=386.16s)]
*  causing debts and unfunded liabilities [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=388.8s)]
*  to balloon to more than double annual revenues. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=391.08000000000004s)]
*  For over a decade, the Government Accountability Office [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=394.48s)]
*  has classified the Postal Service's financial situation [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=397.08000000000004s)]
*  as high-risk and in need of congressional action. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=400.52000000000004s)]
*  At stake is the future of what has been, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  since this nation's founding, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=407.08000000000004s)]
*  the right of every American to send and receive mail. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=409.12s)]
*  The fact is, without some important changes to the law [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=412.48s)]
*  that shape our business model, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  we cannot survive as a self-financing entity. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=416.32s)]
*  Without legislative and regulatory reform, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=419.72s)]
*  our net losses will continue to grow. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=422.36s)]
*  I hope we can agree that the financial state [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=424.68s)]
*  of the Postal Service is unacceptable [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=426.88s)]
*  and needs to be fixed. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=428.92s)]
*  Several reform bills have been introduced in Congress [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=430.4s)]
*  to address the burden of pre-funding healthcare. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=433.24s)]
*  And some also include proposals that would limit the scope [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=436.12s)]
*  of the universal service obligation. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=439.32s)]
*  Do we need six-day-a-week delivery? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=441.71999999999997s)]
*  Should there be delivery to every location in the country? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=446.76s)]
*  Should you have, is it right to have a single rate, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=451.12s)]
*  whether you're mailing a letter across the street [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=455.28s)]
*  or to Alaska or to Hawaii? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=457.28s)]
*  These are sort of elements of service that we've expected [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  as a community or society for the post office to provide. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  But if you're requiring them to live with these constraints, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=468.28s)]
*  then the question is, how do we fairly pay [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=471.76s)]
*  and cover those costs? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=475.56s)]
*  But legislation that changes the USO [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=477.44s)]
*  has been difficult to pass in part [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=479.92s)]
*  because the post office remains so popular with Americans. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=482.32s)]
*  And experts say any operational changes run the risk [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  of inevitably affecting service for some stakeholders. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=489.04s)]
*  Postal policy is very difficult to get enacted. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=492.52000000000004s)]
*  And the reason is that the major stakeholders [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=497.04s)]
*  all want things, and these things often are in tension [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=499.36s)]
*  with one another. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=503.20000000000005s)]
*  But experts say if Americans want the post office to survive, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=504.84000000000003s)]
*  they may need to decide how frequently [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=508.24s)]
*  they need mail delivery. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=510.28000000000003s)]
*  Indifa 55 Cent Stamp is enough to take their letters [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  the distance, however far that might be. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHsJo3rI90&t=514.88s)]
