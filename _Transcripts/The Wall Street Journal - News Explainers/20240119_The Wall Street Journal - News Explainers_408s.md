# What Does the Alaska Airlines Door Plug Incident Mean for Boeing?  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs)
*  A hole in a plane, government investigations, aircraft being grounded, $12 billion wiped [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=0.0s)]
*  from the stock price and airlines re-examining their aircraft to find yet more manufacturing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=5.76s)]
*  faults. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=10.4s)]
*  This wasn't exactly the start to 2024 that Boeing wanted. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=11.78s)]
*  See, after spending years enduring the fallout from the Max Crisis, where two Boeing planes [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=14.64s)]
*  crashed due to a flight control design flaw, killing hundreds of people, the company was [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=18.8s)]
*  finally showing signs of a full recovery. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=23.28s)]
*  They had normalised production levels, they were getting some more respect on Wall Street. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=25.96s)]
*  But then a door plug from an Alaska Airlines Boeing aircraft, which had only been delivered [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=31.28s)]
*  months before, fell off in mid-air, triggering yet another crisis for the company. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=35.24s)]
*  What does Boeing look like in the next few years if it has to deal with another crisis? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=40.68s)]
*  So can Boeing afford another setback? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=45.28s)]
*  While nobody was killed or seriously injured in the Alaska Airlines accident, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  we could have ended up with something so much more tragic and really fortunate that that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=54.76s)]
*  did not occur here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=60.48s)]
*  The door plug, which is a panel used to plug up the space where an emergency exit would [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=62.04s)]
*  be, fell off early in the flight. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=65.88s)]
*  It was shortly after takeoff, passengers were still in their seatbelt, the plane was ascending [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=68.48s)]
*  and there was no one seated right next to the door plug that blew off. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=73.88s)]
*  If somebody had been in that seat, it's likely they probably would have died. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=78.36s)]
*  That's at least what we're told by the NTSB and that's really what's triggered this massive [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=82.56s)]
*  panic and investigation into what actually happened. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=88.0s)]
*  One major question in the accident investigators probe is whether this was a one-off accident [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=91.16s)]
*  with a singular door plug or a manufacturing issue that could affect many of Boeing's aircraft. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=95.48s)]
*  The door plugs are manufactured by a company called Spirit Aerosystems, which actually [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=100.84s)]
*  used to be part of Boeing until the division was spun off in 2005. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=104.9s)]
*  Spirit has said it's working with Boeing to determine what went wrong, but a crucial [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=109.12s)]
*  piece of evidence, the bolts that are supposed to hold the door plug in place, remain missing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  And we have not yet determined if they existed there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  Figuring out what happened with the bolts is a key piece of this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  The accident led to the FAA grounding around 170 Max 9 aircraft and ordering the inspection [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  of the planes. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=129.76s)]
*  But it wasn't long before the reputational damage to Boeing and the FAA began to spread [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=130.76s)]
*  further than the Max 9's door plugs. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=135.56s)]
*  See, when it comes to recommendations, inspections and safety checks for Boeing and other American-made [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=137.76s)]
*  aircraft, airlines and regulators across the globe typically follow the lead of the FAA. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=142.88s)]
*  However, around the same time that both United Airlines and Alaska Airlines announced they'd [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=147.6s)]
*  found loose bolts on their aircraft… [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=152.28s)]
*  What we saw was airlines saying, you know what, we're going to check our aircraft, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=154.72s)]
*  our Boeing Max aircraft, even though they're not the models that the FAA has stipulated [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  need to be checked. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  Despite having no Max 9 aircraft, South Korea, China and India all ordered their airlines [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=166.76s)]
*  to examine their fleet of Max 8 aircraft. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=172.88s)]
*  Though they found nothing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  And Indonesia ordered Lion Air to inspect the doors on its Max 9 aircraft. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=177.44s)]
*  It's certainly a sign that Boeing doesn't have full, full confidence of safety regulators [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  or its airline customers. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=188.84s)]
*  That really speaks to this idea that there may be a loss of faith, not just in Boeing, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=190.72s)]
*  but also in Boeing's oversight by the FAA. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=198.12s)]
*  The FAA's administrator, Mike Whitaker, said the agency showed its global leadership [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=201.64s)]
*  on safety by immediately grounding the Max 9 and said regulators would make sure the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=205.64s)]
*  planes were safe before they fly again. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=210.2s)]
*  That potential loss of faith could impact the range of planes that Boeing is able to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=212.76s)]
*  offer in years to come. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=217.04s)]
*  And to understand why, you need to go back to the Max crashes of 2018 and 2019. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=218.76s)]
*  An Indonesia passenger plane crashing into the sea minutes after takeoff. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=223.32s)]
*  Rescuers have located debris but they do not expect to find any survivors. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=229.0s)]
*  The new Boeing 737 crashing just minutes after takeoff in Ethiopia. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=233.88s)]
*  157 people from more than 30 countries were killed. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  The crashes of two Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft led to the grounding of hundreds of jets for [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  nearly two years. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  The FAA began increasing its oversight of Boeing's manufacturing and the company had [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=248.72s)]
*  to pay billions to compensate airlines due to the Max grounding and problems that emerged [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=253.12s)]
*  with other aircraft. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=258.04s)]
*  It slowed everything down. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=259.44s)]
*  It took up resources, it took up time and so Boeing arguably wasn't able to focus on [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=261.68s)]
*  developing the next new aircraft in a way they could have been. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=268.6s)]
*  Fast forward to 2023 and Boeing now has a far narrower selection of planes than European [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=272.12s)]
*  rival Airbus, whose offering ranges from the 100 seat A220 all the way up to the massive [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=277.24s)]
*  A350-1000. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=282.88s)]
*  Airbus also has the A321neo, which can fly a greater number of passengers farther than [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=283.88s)]
*  Boeing's 737 Max 10, a plane which still isn't certified because of delays related [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=290.08s)]
*  to the Max crisis. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  And that's partly why Airbus, who overtook Boeing as the world's largest plane maker [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=296.68s)]
*  in 2019, was able to post record orders in 2023, far outstripping Boeing's orders. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=300.52s)]
*  And there's a question here. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=307.04s)]
*  Does this difference between the orders speak to maybe the fact that Boeing's management [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=308.20000000000005s)]
*  are distracted? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  You know, they're focused on other things. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=313.96000000000004s)]
*  Where Airbus is able to go out there and just focus on winning orders and working with customers [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=315.8s)]
*  and being able to deliver a more nuanced product line-up that can really take away some of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=320.72s)]
*  the market share that Boeing has. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=325.64000000000004s)]
*  So even though the plane landed safely, could the Alaska Airlines incident disrupt the duopoly [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=327.24s)]
*  between Boeing and Airbus in the long run? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=332.48s)]
*  Well, both Airbus and Boeing have huge manufacturing backlogs, so Airbus is unlikely to gain much [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=335.04s)]
*  of an advantage in the short term. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=340.56s)]
*  They're pretty much sold out for the next, you know, eight, nine years. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=342.4s)]
*  If you want to buy a big chunk of new orders from Airbus, you're really looking at the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=346.4s)]
*  early 2030s before Airbus can even start delivering them. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=350.72s)]
*  And handling the Max crisis may have made Boeing better at dealing with its current woes. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=353.96s)]
*  We're seeing the company already start to do things differently. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=359.08s)]
*  They've said that they will open their factories up to airlines if the airlines want to send [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=362.68s)]
*  crews in to inspect the process. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  But how Boeing goes about restoring faith in its products and its manufacturing over [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=370.68s)]
*  the next few months could dramatically reshape the company in the years to come. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=374.88s)]
*  If they're able to come back very strongly, confident in the fixes, show that they have, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=380.04s)]
*  you know, not only addressed the underlying issues, but managed to win back the confidence [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=386.12s)]
*  of the global industry. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=391.48s)]
*  Maybe this is just a blip. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=393.20000000000005s)]
*  But if there's a lack of faith in the company and its products, we could see Boeing's orders [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=394.20000000000005s)]
*  and its position in the market start to slip further in the long run. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4agr3psAxs&t=399.88s)]
