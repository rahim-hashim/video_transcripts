# The Great Resignation, Explained in One Chart  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 04, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0)
*  Here's a bird's eye view of the monumental shifts happening across the American workforce [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=0.0s)]
*  right now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=5.08s)]
*  The lines above zero show the sectors that saw the strongest job growth since right before [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=6.08s)]
*  the pandemic, while the lines below show the ones that have seen the biggest declines. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=10.38s)]
*  It's evidence of a larger phenomenon that is touching almost every industry. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=15.26s)]
*  Business is closing their doors, employees working crazy hours. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=20.16s)]
*  It's all because of the so-called great resignation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=24.46s)]
*  In August, more than 4 million workers quit their jobs, a record 20-year high. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=27.88s)]
*  A lot of people are taking time to reevaluate what they want to do with their lives and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=33.2s)]
*  what work actually means to them. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=39.72s)]
*  For millions of workers and businesses, the great resignation is a period that could define [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  the future of American labor. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=46.64s)]
*  This is how we got to this point and what we know about where the workers are going. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=48.94s)]
*  The first thing to know is that this chart is showing just a slice of the labor force [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=55.08s)]
*  between February 2020 and September 2021 from the Labor Department's September jobs report. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=58.72s)]
*  There are hundreds of other industries that have seen growth and declines during this [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=64.72s)]
*  period as well, some that didn't have data available for September. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=68.2s)]
*  But what the numbers suggest is clear. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=72.44s)]
*  Thousands of workers lost their jobs in certain sectors, and many aren't returning. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  Let's go back to spring 2020, when the pandemic took hold. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=79.64s)]
*  Weekly unemployment claims hit a stunning new high today with 6.6 million Americans [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=83.64s)]
*  filing just last week. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=88.2s)]
*  As the pandemic spread, businesses shuttered their doors and tens of millions of people [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=89.88s)]
*  lost their jobs. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=94.0s)]
*  To help workers and businesses stay afloat, the federal government began handing out relief [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=95.6s)]
*  payments. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=99.86s)]
*  And if we look widely at the labor data, it's clear that certain industries lost more workers [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=100.86s)]
*  and had a harder time gaining them back than others. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=105.64s)]
*  Employment in motion picture and sound recording industries is still 23% lower than it was [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=109.16s)]
*  in February 2020. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=113.6s)]
*  And other sectors hit hardest by the pandemic have been travel and hospitality. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=115.42s)]
*  It's clear if you look at this line, employment and travel arrangement and reservation services [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=120.0s)]
*  is still almost 25% below February 2020 levels, the biggest decline among job sectors in September [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=124.72s)]
*  data. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=131.32s)]
*  Worker job growth in travel-related sectors is probably a reflection of both companies' [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=132.32s)]
*  inability to find workers, but also weaker demand for travel-related services, especially [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=139.4s)]
*  as the pandemic continued during the summer. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=146.38s)]
*  Sarah Cheney-Cambon has been reporting on the Great Resignation and American labor shortage [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=149.28s)]
*  for The Wall Street Journal. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=153.48s)]
*  She pointed out that transit and ground passenger transportation jobs also saw a huge hit, losing [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=155.24s)]
*  over 18%. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=160.62s)]
*  One part of this sector that has been impacted heavily is ride sharing, which has experienced [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=162.72s)]
*  a nationwide shortage of drivers. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=167.1s)]
*  And while some have slowly returned as government relief has ended, many of these workers are [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=169.42000000000002s)]
*  staying off the roads. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  For workers with demanding, lower-paying jobs, the pandemic relief payments may have made [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=176.42000000000002s)]
*  them less motivated to return. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  And another concern weighing heavily on many has been the risk of getting COVID. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=183.76s)]
*  Between mid-June and early October, the number of people who said they couldn't work because [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=187.74s)]
*  they were sick with or caring for someone with COVID rose by 2 million. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=192.02s)]
*  Also during this time, some older workers chose to reassess their priorities. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=196.20000000000002s)]
*  The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimates that over 2.5 million people retired during [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=200.44s)]
*  the pandemic, about twice as many as in 2019. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=205.16000000000003s)]
*  And that approximately 1.5 million of these workers would not have retired if the pandemic [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=208.8s)]
*  had not happened. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=213.32000000000002s)]
*  So a lot of baby boomers have retired early during the pandemic, in part because of concerns [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=214.78s)]
*  about COVID. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=221.14s)]
*  Others have seen really big gains from the stock market or housing prices going up a [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=223.34s)]
*  ton, and so they're in a comfortable financial situation. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=229.38s)]
*  But many of the workers who are leaving jobs aren't leaving the workforce entirely. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=232.9s)]
*  A lot of people are quitting their jobs, maybe because they've experienced burnout during [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=237.1s)]
*  the pandemic or they're just looking for different opportunities. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=242.68s)]
*  And an increasing number of these workers are switching jobs. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=246.16s)]
*  If you're seeing workers switch from one industry to another, it's oftentimes because they can [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=249.6s)]
*  get better pay or better working conditions in the industry that they're transitioning to. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  Some employers are offering higher wages and health care benefits to try and attract new [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=260.62s)]
*  workers. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=265.04s)]
*  And the U.S. economy added about 3 million jobs from April through September this year, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=266.48s)]
*  though employment was still down over 3 percent compared with the month before the pandemic hit. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=271.4s)]
*  Still, many of these workers have started jobs in industries that have benefited from [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=276.29999999999995s)]
*  pandemic-driven shifts. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=280.46s)]
*  E-commerce has really taken off and that's created a lot of jobs at warehouses, at manufacturers, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=282.09999999999997s)]
*  and shipping and postal companies. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=289.46s)]
*  And we see that very clearly in the jobs data. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=292.53999999999996s)]
*  Couriers and messenger jobs saw more than an 18 percent increase, the largest of any [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  sector in the September data, while the warehousing and storage field saw over an 11 percent [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=300.65999999999997s)]
*  rise. Some industries were doing really well before the pandemic started and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=305.58s)]
*  the pandemic only helps them. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=311.97999999999996s)]
*  Anything related to science and research and development was growing pretty strongly [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=313.94s)]
*  before the pandemic started. And then after you had demand for vaccines. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=318.53999999999996s)]
*  And so that that definitely creates a lot of jobs. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=323.02s)]
*  You can see it here. Scientific research and development service jobs grew by almost 10 [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=325.82s)]
*  percent. COVID cases have declined since the September jobs report, and some economists [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=330.6s)]
*  are optimistic that more workers will return this fall. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=335.5s)]
*  Still, others are concerned that labor shortages reflect longer term shifts away from the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=338.92s)]
*  workforce that won't reverse, meaning some of these industries could be faced with [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=343.74s)]
*  long lasting changes. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2retN4TEA0&t=348.08s)]
