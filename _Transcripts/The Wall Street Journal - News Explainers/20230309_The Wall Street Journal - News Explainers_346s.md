# How the U.S. Spent $1.4 Trillion in Debt Last Year  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o)
*  This penny isn't worth one cent. It's worth ten billion dollars at least for this video [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, and it's going into the Treasury to be spent on an entire year of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=5.8s)]
*  the Environmental Protection Agency [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Here's how much went to unemployment and NASA [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=14.6s)]
*  Last year more than six trillion dollars or six hundred and twenty seven pennies were spent on different programs [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=19.04s)]
*  But that required taking on more than one trillion dollars in debt [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=25.88s)]
*  Let's go to the board to look at federal spending including that debt and the ways the US could borrow fewer pennies [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=30.8s)]
*  But first where did all the pennies spent in 2022 come from? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=38.28s)]
*  Here's how many came from revenue things like individual income taxes and payroll taxes and corporate taxes [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  Congress is responsible for both these totals [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  They set the tax rate and they authorize the spending but since these don't match up [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=53.88s)]
*  The Treasury takes on debt to cover this difference [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  They do that by selling securities like say a 20 year bond an investor gives the Treasury money and the Treasury would pay interest [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=62.6s)]
*  on that every six months [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=70.48s)]
*  They'll do that until the 20 years is over and then the investor will get their money back [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=72.48s)]
*  But those interest payments add up [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  That is one of the expenses that people who worry about the debt and the deficit like to focus on the most or they see [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=80.12s)]
*  As one of the biggest problems is how much does the US government pay on an annual basis? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  Just on paying its previous debts in 2022. It was a lot [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=90.48s)]
*  8.5 percent of all spending went to paying interest on that debt [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=96.28s)]
*  The concern is that so much money over time will start going just towards the debt that you may not be able to spend what you [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=100.28s)]
*  Want to spend on other issues here are the other places the US spent money in 2022 [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=105.68s)]
*  This biggest section here is all Social Security [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=110.64s)]
*  these sections Medicare and Medicaid [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=114.56s)]
*  This third biggest section is the military [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=117.92s)]
*  Then there's the Department of Education [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=121.52s)]
*  Most of this is student loans the cost of Biden's potential student loan forgiveness plan [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=123.8s)]
*  There's tax credits like child credits veterans affairs and nutritional services like snap [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=129.36s)]
*  The rest of this other category went to smaller places like coronavirus relief the Department of Transportation or [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=135.92s)]
*  Homeland Security [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=143.44s)]
*  Beyond Medicare Social Security interest payments on the debt and the Pentagon budget [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=145.27999999999997s)]
*  everything you think of in terms of what the federal government does on an annual basis is actually a [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=151.0s)]
*  small minority of actual annual government spending in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=156.16s)]
*  2022 more than 20 percent of that spending was funded by taking on debt [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=160.56s)]
*  This is the total amount of debt built up every year [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=166.11999999999998s)]
*  It's currently a little over 30 trillion dollars and there's a cap to how much this can be the infamous [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  Debt ceiling debt ceiling debt ceiling that limit is currently 31 trillion dollars an amount that the Treasury is set to hit in June [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=176.83999999999997s)]
*  When that happens they'll be unable to take on extra debt through those securities [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=184.48s)]
*  Which means there won't be enough cash to pay Social Security benefits seniors won't get their checks [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=189.0s)]
*  Neither would members of the military and these debt holders wouldn't get their interest payments that would [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=194.72s)]
*  Create all sorts of financial and economic problems because US treasuries are viewed as kind of the safe haven asset for the global [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=201.6s)]
*  Financial system there's this idea that if suddenly investors thought well if I buy [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=209.2s)]
*  US government debt I might not get my money back that there could be a sell-off in US government bonds and that would [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=214.12s)]
*  Raise interest rates across the world economy [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=219.92s)]
*  It's up to Congress to pass a bill that the president then signs to raise this limit [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=222.76s)]
*  So that doesn't happen both parties agree this chart should go down [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  But they disagree on how to do that if you're trying to reduce the deficit or eventually even reduce the debt [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=231.16s)]
*  It is to either cut spending or to raise taxes many Democrats want to raise taxes on the rich and corporations [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=238.2s)]
*  I want to make it clear [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=245.56s)]
*  I want to make it clear. I'm gonna raise some taxes [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=247.72s)]
*  Many of your billionaires out there. You're gonna stop paying at 3% [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=251.72s)]
*  While Republicans largely want to see spending cuts and they want those cuts as a condition for raising the debt ceiling [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=256.48s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy even promised to do it as part of his deal to become speaker the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=263.72s)]
*  Responsible debt limit increase that puts us on a path towards a healthier economy [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=268.56s)]
*  But Democrats want just a clean race to the debt limit to be able to pay for this spending Congress already approved [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=274.02s)]
*  It is something that should be happy that should be done without conditions. There shouldn't be we should not be negotiating around it [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=280.34s)]
*  So if there were cuts where might they come from cuts to Social Security and Medicare seemed to not be an option [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=287.5s)]
*  Social Security Medicare is off the off the books now [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=294.74s)]
*  And [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=297.02s)]
*  Not all Republicans support cuts to the military I think there's there's room for savings in the military too [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=302.74s)]
*  We've got to get spending under control, but we are not going to do it on the backs of our troops [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=308.41999999999996s)]
*  Which only leaves these departments and discretionary programs as places for cuts [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=313.14s)]
*  It's safe to say that marginal cuts while you know something that may be worth considering in various ways and whether it's a wise use [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  Of resources to begin with are not something necessarily something that's going to make a major difference towards [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=325.02s)]
*  Reducing a deficit or you know balancing the budget for example [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=329.97999999999996s)]
*  While Democrats and Republicans may disagree how to do that they both agree that the US can't let the penny stop [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9nTc4rg37o&t=333.5s)]
