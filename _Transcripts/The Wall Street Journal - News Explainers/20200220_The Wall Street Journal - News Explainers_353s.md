# How Presidential Debates Transformed Over Time | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 20, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg)
*  — Televised presidential debates have been an American political tradition for the past [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=0.0s)]
*  60 years. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=7.8s)]
*  But while they're far from perfect, they're still beneficial to voters as a means to learn [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=8.8s)]
*  about a candidate. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=13.84s)]
*  — There was locker room talk. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=14.84s)]
*  — What's more, they can make or break an election. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=16.16s)]
*  So what, if anything, can be done to improve them? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=19.7s)]
*  — The candidates need no introduction. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=22.68s)]
*  — It's telling that the first ever televised presidential debate in 1960 between candidates [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=24.44s)]
*  Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy remains famous not for what was said, but for how [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=29.6s)]
*  each candidate looked. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=34.6s)]
*  Although Nixon and Kennedy talked extensively about the big issues of the time, like the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=37.2s)]
*  Cold War and civil rights, what is best remembered today is each candidate's appearance. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  — The Nixon-Kennedy debates in 1960 were actually the beginning of the modern televised [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=46.64s)]
*  debate era. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=50.96s)]
*  There was actually four debates in 1960, but what everybody remembers is the first debate [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=51.96s)]
*  where Kennedy looked healthy and Nixon looked sweaty and sick. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=57.04s)]
*  He paid a price for that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  And what people remembered was how they looked, not what they said. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=62.08s)]
*  — For better or worse, the Kennedy-Nixon matchups had a precedent of style over substance [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=65.72s)]
*  that's only grown more prevalent in televised debates. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=70.48s)]
*  — What tends to be remembered from debates are moments. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=73.4s)]
*  And usually they're moments of gaffes or mistakes, not high moments or great moments. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=76.0s)]
*  — That was the case with the next debate in 1976, when President Gerald Ford faced [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=80.72s)]
*  off against his Democratic challenger, Jimmy Carter. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=85.88000000000001s)]
*  — What Ford said really wasn't a gaffe. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  It just sort of came out not the way he intended it to be. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  — There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=94.84s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=101.44s)]
*  — What he said essentially was that the people of Poland don't consider themselves [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=102.48s)]
*  to be subjugated to Soviet rule. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  And that was true. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=109.12s)]
*  The way it came across and the way it was portrayed, unfortunately for him, was that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=110.12s)]
*  he was naive. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=113.12s)]
*  He thought the Polish people weren't really under the Soviet thumb, when in fact, of course, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=114.12s)]
*  in those days they were. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=117.92s)]
*  That's again what everybody remembered from that debate. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=119.4s)]
*  And it didn't help him. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=121.36s)]
*  — You already are the oldest president in history. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=122.36s)]
*  — Poignant moments in a debate can also help a candidate. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=125.56s)]
*  In 1984, Ronald Reagan famously put questions about his age to bed with this quip. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=128.8s)]
*  — I will not make age an issue of this campaign. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=134.04000000000002s)]
*  I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=137.48s)]
*  — In the first debate, Reagan didn't look all that good. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=144.28s)]
*  He looked a little old. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=147.28s)]
*  He was stumbling around a bit. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=148.28s)]
*  That produced some stories, including ironically a famous one on the front page of the Wall [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  Street Journal that said the age factor has arisen. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  So the Reagan campaign knew going into that debate they had an age issue to deal with. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  It did defuse the age question for the rest of that campaign. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=160.76s)]
*  — And debates also have the added pressure of going viral. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=164.64s)]
*  — Sometimes debate moments that don't go well can be not just bad, they can be almost fatal. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  — It's three agencies of government when I get there that are gone. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=172.76s)]
*  Commerce, education, and the, what's the third one there? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=180.76s)]
*  — That was the case for Rick Perry in 2011 when he got halfway into a debate answer and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=181.76s)]
*  then couldn't remember the rest of it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=186.72s)]
*  — The third one I can't, sorry. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=188.04s)]
*  Oops. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  — Or Mitt Romney's famous slip up in 2012. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  — I went to a number of women's groups and said, can you help us find folks? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=194.12s)]
*  And they brought us a whole binder full of women. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=196.84s)]
*  — He was trying to say that I have paid attention to advancing women in my career. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=199.84s)]
*  I have a record of doing it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=204.56s)]
*  But it came across badly. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=206.32s)]
*  It came across in a way that made it look as if women were nothing but sheets of paper [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  in a binder to him. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=211.24s)]
*  — Clearly debates can have an effect on the outcome of an election. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=212.6s)]
*  But what can be done to improve them? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  — I think it's crucial when you're analyzing debates to distinguish between primary season [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  debates and general election debates. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=222.08s)]
*  They're two quite different animals. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  And I think, in my opinion, one works way better than the other. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=226.32000000000002s)]
*  — Primary debates tend to be free-for-alls where there's no particular format or formula [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  from one debate to the next. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=233.44s)]
*  — They tend to be sponsored by media organizations, sometimes by state parties, sometimes by combinations [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=235.0s)]
*  of all of the above. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=240.68s)]
*  — In contrast, the general election debates are a bit more sober and controlled. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=242.06s)]
*  — General election debates are conducted with the Commission of Presidential Debates, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=246.56s)]
*  which was established in 1987, which has done this through eight presidential cycles [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=249.88s)]
*  and which knows how to do it right and in a distinguished way. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=254.04s)]
*  — One proposal is to remove live studio audiences. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=257.36s)]
*  — And from the Wall Street Journal, Jerry Seid. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=260.88s)]
*  — Well, first of all, I've done three debates with live audiences who are partisans. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=263.28s)]
*  And so I know what the atmosphere is like. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=267.68s)]
*  And it can be problematic. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=269.64s)]
*  It is basically becomes a campaign rally to some extent. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=271.12s)]
*  And I don't think it's the ideal way to hold a presidential debate. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=274.64s)]
*  — Hell yes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=277.56s)]
*  — Take your AR-15, your AK-47. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=278.56s)]
*  — A smaller audience that is not filled with campaign partisans is a better way to go. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=280.84s)]
*  — Another, at least for the primaries, is to reduce the number of candidates on stage. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=286.24s)]
*  — A debate with too many candidates is very unwieldy. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=290.96s)]
*  It's hard to conduct a meaningful, substantive conversation that follows a logical progression. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=293.72s)]
*  — We don't have time for tone. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=298.4s)]
*  — The biggest question hanging over the 2020 debates is the issue of President Donald Trump's participation. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  — What President Trump has said is that he thinks the debate commission was unfair to him in 2016, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  and he's not sure he's going to agree to do the three presidential debates that they have set up. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=313.68s)]
*  I think that would be a mistake. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=318.76s)]
*  I think it would be bad for the country, bad for the campaign, bad for democracy. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  It's easy to be critical of debates because they can be very messy and they're not always perfect. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=324.76s)]
*  But when I think about debates, I think a little bit about what Winston Churchill said about democracy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=329.04s)]
*  He said, democracy is the worst form of government, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=333.08000000000004s)]
*  except every other form of government that anybody's ever tried. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  They can be messy, they're not perfect, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=338.8s)]
*  but they're a better way to get the candidates to address voters and address each other [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  and address issues than anything else I can think of. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CApw6pwIpsg&t=345.20000000000005s)]
