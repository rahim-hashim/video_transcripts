# How El Salvador President Bukele Became a Right-Wing Icon | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4)
*  Salvadoran President Naib Bukele has become one of the biggest right-wing icons in the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=0.0s)]
*  His crackdown on El Salvador's gangs has inspired many in the U.S. conservative movement, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=5.92s)]
*  especially members of Trump's inner circle. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=10.64s)]
*  A lot of us in the MAGA movement believe that the good ideas we've seen in El Salvador, we can learn from. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Bukele has agreed to accept U.S. detainees at El Salvador's mega prison, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=19.92s)]
*  making him a key player in Trump's mass deportation strategy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  I have great respect for him. I know him. He's very tough on crime. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=27.599999999999998s)]
*  But concern is growing over Bukele's increasingly close relationship with Trump and many of his allies. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=31.84s)]
*  Since taking office in 2019, Bukele has helped turn a country that was once the murder capital [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=38.56s)]
*  of the world into one of the safest in Latin America. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=43.84s)]
*  We did the unthinkable to cleanse our society. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  He has jailed over 1% of the population, giving El Salvador the highest incarceration rate in the world. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=50.08s)]
*  He also built the world's largest prison, known as Secote. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=56.24s)]
*  But the country's transformation hasn't come without criticism. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=60.0s)]
*  Since 2022, Bukele has ruled under emergency powers that suspend civil liberties, including due process. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=63.6s)]
*  Rights groups say his time in office has been marked by an erosion of checks and balances, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=70.48s)]
*  widespread human rights violations, and arbitrary detentions, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=74.88s)]
*  along with the weakening of opposition parties and attacks against freedom of expression and independent media. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  Bukele's press office denied the allegations and said that before Bukele took office, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=83.92s)]
*  there were widespread human rights abuses by the gangs on law-abiding citizens. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=88.56s)]
*  The president addressed the concerns of rights groups in 2024, saying this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=93.2s)]
*  They were worried about the human rights of the killers, which, you know, they have human rights. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=97.52s)]
*  I don't say they don't. They're humans. But if you have to prioritize, what will you prioritize? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=102.88s)]
*  He's a democratically elected president. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=110.16s)]
*  Damian Merlo has been working with Bukele since 2018 and acts as the president's advisor and his link to D.C. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=112.56s)]
*  If people aren't happy, then the next election they can vote for someone else. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=119.44s)]
*  People are participating at a very high rate in these elections and they are voting for his party and for his allies. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=123.36s)]
*  Former Congressman Matt Gaetz led the launch of a bipartisan El Salvador caucus in 2024. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=130.56s)]
*  My friends. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=135.84s)]
*  He owns a home there and visits several times a year. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  Bukele's landslide victory in 2024 came after the courts allowed him to seek reelection, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=139.68s)]
*  despite a constitutional ban on running for a second consecutive term. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=145.36s)]
*  I believe El Salvador should amend their constitution, should remove the presidential [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=149.28s)]
*  term limit and should allow President Bukele to continue this transformation that will lift people up. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=154.8s)]
*  A big part of Bukele's appeal is his use of social media to rebrand El Salvador in the eyes of the world. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=162.0s)]
*  Bukele now markets the country as the land of surf, volcanoes and coffee. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=168.24s)]
*  He hosts international events like the 72nd Miss Universe Competition. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=172.8s)]
*  He comes from an advertising background and he knows exactly how to market not just to his own country, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=179.68s)]
*  but increasingly to the outside. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=184.8s)]
*  Vera Bergen-Grewen is one of two U.S. journalists who have interviewed Bukele in the last five years. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  When he became president, there was quite a noticeable shift where he started, for example, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=192.16s)]
*  tweeting a lot more in English. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=196.48s)]
*  And even the videos that are in Spanish tend to have English subtitles. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=198.64s)]
*  He knows that's where his growing fan club is. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=203.2s)]
*  One of the other things that really struck me is also how he's changed some of the rhetoric he uses. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  For example, in his interview with Tucker Carlson and also in general, he speaks a lot more about God. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  All my security cabinet are believers. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=217.6s)]
*  They all believe in God. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  We're a secular country, of course, but we all believe in God. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=221.2s)]
*  He speaks a lot more in the language of kind of the Christian right wing of the United States. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=225.44s)]
*  And everyone I spoke to in El Salvador and elsewhere who's tracked him for a long time [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=230.32s)]
*  says that kind of language is quite new. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=235.52s)]
*  President Bukele sort of first was noticed by the MAGA movement [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=238.24s)]
*  when we did the visit to the Heritage Foundation. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=242.72s)]
*  That's the conservative research institute in D.C. behind Project 2025, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=245.28s)]
*  a controversial policy blueprint for the federal government. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=249.92s)]
*  El Salvador needs the support of the most influential think tank in the world. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=253.28s)]
*  A big turning point was when he traveled to Maine to do the interview with Tucker Urius still at Fox. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=258.88s)]
*  I think most governments would rather let people have guns than free speech. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=265.04s)]
*  Free speech is a real threat to them. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=268.24s)]
*  Well, that's why they hate free speech. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=269.92s)]
*  He was invited to CPAC, which is sort of an annual woodstock for Republicans. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=272.48s)]
*  What I remember so vividly is as President Bukele was coming in the back room in the kitchen, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=278.32s)]
*  the entire hotel staff, it seemed, was there holding, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=283.92s)]
*  We Love You Bukele, holding their Salvadorian flags. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=288.32s)]
*  And he gave this remarkable speech. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=291.44s)]
*  They say globalism comes to die at CPAC. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=293.6s)]
*  I'm here to tell you that in El Salvador, it's already dead. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=298.96s)]
*  He probably had the second longest line for pictures after President Trump. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=304.08s)]
*  Bukele has done quite an impressive job making inroads with the MAGA wing of the Republican Party. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=307.92s)]
*  Donald Trump Jr. and Alex Brusowitz, the digital strategist behind Trump's podcast strategy, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  were among many MAGA Republicans at Bukele's second inauguration. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  Bukele has also developed a relationship with Elon Musk. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  I was like, how did you put all those thugs in prison without dying? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=326.64s)]
*  Because it seems like that would have been not easy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=330.32s)]
*  They met in person for the first time in Texas in late 2024. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=332.72s)]
*  Welcome to Texas. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  Bukele and Trump have kept up a relationship over the years, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=337.92s)]
*  despite having only met in person once before in 2019. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=341.44s)]
*  Bukele, you know, makes no secret of the fact that he's a big fan of Donald Trump. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=345.12s)]
*  President Trump is very nice and cool, and nice and cool, too. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=349.92s)]
*  We both use Twitter a lot, so we'll get along. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=354.56s)]
*  He shares a lot of his ideas about being tough on crime, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  but really it's the global right-wing language of being against international institutions. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=361.68s)]
*  The EU was set up in order to take advantage of the United States. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=367.92s)]
*  The corrupt system work in tandem with the so-called international community, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  the NGOs, and of course the fake news. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=377.68s)]
*  Bukele, he's a strong critic of aid in a lot of ways. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=380.56s)]
*  In the past, these nations have defined their relationships with [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=383.92s)]
*  the United States and other hegemons through the distribution of foreign aid. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=388.08s)]
*  The chance for that type of nationalism to resist the globalist impulses does inspire some of us. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=392.4s)]
*  Bukele's allies also fired top judges and packed the courts with loyalists. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=399.84s)]
*  That is incredibly appealing to a lot of people in Trump's orbit as well, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=404.32s)]
*  the idea that if a judge is trying to block you, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  then you can just basically get rid of them and just carry out your agenda. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=410.79999999999995s)]
*  Bukele's new court allowed him to run again in a consecutive term. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=414.56s)]
*  Trump himself hasn't ruled out running for a third term. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=418.24s)]
*  People are asking me to run and there's a whole story about running for a third term. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=421.6s)]
*  I don't know, I never looked into it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=425.6s)]
*  They do say there's a way you can do it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=428.64s)]
*  In the last few months, Trump has been praising Bukele, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=430.64s)]
*  calling him a model for others seeking to work with the United States. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=433.76s)]
*  But just last year, Trump's opinion of him was quite different. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=437.44s)]
*  He says how well the country's doing because their crime rate is down. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=440.96s)]
*  And he said he's training all of these rough people, they're rough, rough, rough. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=445.03999999999996s)]
*  But then I realized he's not training them, he's sending all of his criminals, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=448.56s)]
*  his drug dealers, his people that are in jails, he's sending them all to the United States. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=453.03999999999996s)]
*  It does remain to be seen if Bukele keeps getting all of this global credit as being [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=458.64s)]
*  the greatest crime fighter in the hemisphere, whether Trump will want to keep praising him [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=462.96s)]
*  or whether he will kind of go back to what he tends to do, which is just kind of go after [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=468.56s)]
*  basically any Latin American country as a bad place that is sending criminals to the United States. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  For now, though, Bukele remains an important ally of the Trump administration, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=478.48s)]
*  especially with Bukele's influence spreading across Latin America. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=482.8s)]
*  I think the Trump administration has realized that he's a reliable partner [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=486.64s)]
*  on rebuilding the economy of El Salvador, which is one of the root causes of migration in the U.S. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=491.04s)]
*  To see a renewed nationalism, that invigorates the opportunities for people like Mele, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=496.56s)]
*  Bolsonaro, if he's allowed to run again, that does give us comfort in the United States that [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=503.36s)]
*  that there is someone of common mind who doesn't believe that China is the ideal [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4&t=508.32s)]
