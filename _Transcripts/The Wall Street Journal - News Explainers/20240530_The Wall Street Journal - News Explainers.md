# Trump Found Guilty Key Trial Moments That Led to Hush-Money Conviction  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE)
*  Donald Trump was found guilty of felony charges for his role in covering up a hush money payment [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=0.0s)]
*  to porn star Stormy Daniels. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=6.2s)]
*  Mother Teresa could not beat these charges. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=7.96s)]
*  These charges are rigged. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=10.96s)]
*  The whole thing is rigged. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=12.96s)]
*  WSJ's courts reporter Corinne Raimi watched it all unfold inside the courtroom. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=14.48s)]
*  She walks us through key moments from the trial and explains what the verdict means [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=19.64s)]
*  for Trump. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=23.52s)]
*  The center of the charges against Trump were dozens of documents, including 11 checks, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=27.88s)]
*  11 invoices, and 12 entries in Trump's general ledger. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=32.56s)]
*  This was ultimately not a trial about an affair. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=35.8s)]
*  It was a trial about business documents and a cover-up, right? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=38.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=41.44s)]
*  Trump was charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=42.44s)]
*  Falsifying business records in New York is a misdemeanor. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=47.2s)]
*  But here it's a felony because prosecutors had to show that Trump was seeking to commit [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=49.6s)]
*  or conceal a second crime. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=55.72s)]
*  Prosecutors argued that the reason Trump falsified business records was to cover up a conspiracy [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  to illegally promote his election to the presidency. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=62.76s)]
*  A conspiracy, they said, that involved Trump, his fixer Michael Cohen, and the publisher [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=66.24s)]
*  of the National Enquirer, David Pecker, who worked together to catch and kill stories [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=70.84s)]
*  damaging to Trump's campaign, like the story about an alleged affair with porn star Stormy [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=75.28s)]
*  who Cohen paid $130,000 to silence in the final days of the 2016 campaign. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=80.82s)]
*  Trump has denied the affair. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=86.97999999999999s)]
*  The prosecution kicked things off by calling Pecker to the stand to outline the conspiracy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  They establish not only is there a conspiracy, but there's a specific moment when this supposedly [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=95.22s)]
*  begins. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=101.17999999999999s)]
*  So they have this meeting. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=102.17999999999999s)]
*  Then here we have Pecker talking about how he is Trump's eyes and ears. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=103.17999999999999s)]
*  And here we have sort of him defining the catch and kill scheme. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=108.62s)]
*  He says, I'd notify Michael Cohen, and then he would be able to have them kill in another [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=111.98s)]
*  magazine or have them not be published or somebody would have to purchase them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=115.98s)]
*  Pecker also testified that he helped buy and kill two stories that could be damaging to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=120.30000000000001s)]
*  Trump in order to help Trump's campaign. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=124.34s)]
*  After establishing the conspiracy, prosecutors called Hope Hicks, Trump's former communications [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=127.66000000000001s)]
*  director, and they took jurors back to the weeks before the 2016 election. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=132.06s)]
*  Hope Hicks was important because she talked about how the campaign was in crisis mode [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=136.62s)]
*  in responding to the Access Hollywood tape. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=141.9s)]
*  I don't even wait. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=144.02s)]
*  And when you're a star, they let you do it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=145.02s)]
*  You can do anything. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=147.26000000000002s)]
*  Whatever you want. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=148.26000000000002s)]
*  Grab them by the pussy. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=149.26000000000002s)]
*  She explained to the jury why the hush money payment was really responding to this crisis [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=150.26000000000002s)]
*  within the campaign and was not made for purposes of Melania or Trump's family. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=155.78s)]
*  Then the prosecution called porn star Stormy Daniels. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=162.62s)]
*  Were you expecting Stormy Daniels to take the stand? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=166.18s)]
*  This was a real unknown going into the trial. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=168.58s)]
*  We didn't know if Stormy would take the stand. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=170.58s)]
*  In some ways, she's tangential to the case. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=172.38s)]
*  Her testimony absolutely mattered. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=175.54000000000002s)]
*  What didn't matter was whether that 2006 alleged sexual encounter happened. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=177.5s)]
*  It doesn't matter if Trump and Stormy had sex. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=183.66s)]
*  What matters is that Stormy was trying to sell her story. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=186.38s)]
*  And I think when she was on the stand, the jurors saw what that story looked like. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=189.98000000000002s)]
*  Throughout the trial, the jury also heard about Trump as a businessman from former staffers [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=194.66s)]
*  and also from books he wrote. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=199.1s)]
*  He writes, as I said before, I always sign my checks so I know where my money's going. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=201.34s)]
*  That helped establish a pattern to show that Trump was a micromanager of his business dealings. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=207.3s)]
*  Finally, the prosecution called its star witness. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=212.74s)]
*  Michael Cohen is an extremely flawed witness. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=217.26s)]
*  How did the prosecution set him up so that he was ultimately believable to the jury? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=220.42s)]
*  Well before Michael Cohen even walked in that room, I think those jurors felt like they [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=225.66s)]
*  already had met Michael Cohen. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=229.33999999999997s)]
*  And they had established, before he even got on the stand, why all of what Cohen said made [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=231.29999999999998s)]
*  sense, corroborated much of it with other witnesses, that the jurors essentially didn't [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=236.7s)]
*  need to take any kind of leap of faith to believe Cohen or in the instances when nobody [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=242.7s)]
*  else could speak to what Cohen could speak to, they were set up to believe him. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=248.98s)]
*  So let's look at what some of Cohen actually said in court. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=253.22s)]
*  First, he said Trump directed the hush money payment to begin with, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=255.78s)]
*  He did. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=260.18s)]
*  And he said Trump said to him, just do it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=261.18s)]
*  And then there's testimony about Cohen trying to get his money back. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=264.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=267.46s)]
*  And Trump's sitting right there and the prosecutor says, what did Trump do or something to that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=268.46s)]
*  effect? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=274.09999999999997s)]
*  And Cohen says, he approved it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=275.09999999999997s)]
*  And that's really important because it goes to the heart of Trump having a role in the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=276.18s)]
*  creation of those false documents. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=281.5s)]
*  Ultimately, the jury found that Trump falsified business documents to pay Cohen back for his [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=283.5s)]
*  $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, disguising the reimbursement payments as money for a [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=288.58000000000004s)]
*  legal retainer. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=294.22s)]
*  Why didn't Trump testify? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=295.58000000000004s)]
*  Defense attorneys typically advise their clients not to testify. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=297.58000000000004s)]
*  It's really, really risky. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=300.8s)]
*  It's a little bit of a Hail Mary move. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=301.8s)]
*  And if Trump had gotten on that stand, prosecutors could have asked him about all kinds of things. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=304.46s)]
*  The verdict made Trump the first former U.S. president ever convicted of a crime. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=310.46s)]
*  Next, Trump will be sentenced by Justice Juan Marchand. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=315.02s)]
*  What are the possibilities when it comes to sentencing? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=318.53999999999996s)]
*  It's got a full menu of possibilities. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=321.02s)]
*  Probation, he could give him a jail sentence. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=323.34s)]
*  He could give him essentially no sentence at all as long as he doesn't commit another [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=325.94s)]
*  crime. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=331.46s)]
*  Trump, who faces three other criminal indictments in separate cases, has denied wrongdoing [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=332.46s)]
*  and has painted the trial as a politically motivated sham. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=336.82s)]
*  Trump has plenty of legal issues to grapple with as he campaigns. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=340.29999999999995s)]
*  How all of this plays out is really up in the air if he becomes president because it's [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=344.02s)]
*  unprecedented. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H01qQ1IODE&t=349.09999999999997s)]
