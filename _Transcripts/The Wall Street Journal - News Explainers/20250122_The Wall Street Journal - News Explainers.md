Video Description: President Trump promised voters that he would conduct large-scale deportations of illegal immigrants, but millions of them are a key source of labor in U.S. agriculture. About two-thirds of the nation’s crop-farm workers are foreign-born and, according to the labor department, roughly 42% of these immigrants are not legally authorized to work in the U.S. So how would removing these workers impact the food supply chain?

WSJ explores how Trump’s plans to deport millions could upend the agriculture industry.

# The Hidden Costs of Trump's Mass Deportations | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY)
*  On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump promised [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=0.0s)]
*  The largest deportation operation in American history [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=4.0s)]
*  But many of the millions of migrants that Trump wants to deport are a key source of labor in the United States, particularly in the agriculture industry [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=8.0s)]
*  We want a secure border, but we also understand that immigrant labor is important to agriculture [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=16.0s)]
*  There are plenty of people who would be willing to come here lawfully and do the work [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=23.0s)]
*  Here's a look at how Trump's immigration plans could upend agriculture in the U.S. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=27.0s)]
*  About two-thirds of the nation's crop farm workers are immigrants [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=33.0s)]
*  And roughly 42% of them are not legally authorized to work in the U.S., according to the Department of Agriculture [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=36.0s)]
*  Workers don't even ask if the food is going to go into a Republican or Democratic home [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=42.0s)]
*  They just work to feed us [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=47.0s)]
*  Teresa Romero is the president of the labor union United Farm Workers [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=49.0s)]
*  She says migrants often perform some of the most challenging and unappealing jobs in agriculture [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=53.0s)]
*  This is a work that is demanding, that is dangerous, that is very physical [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=58.0s)]
*  There's long hours, the workers are dying [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=64.0s)]
*  Too often the phrase, oh, these are jobs Americans won't do, is thrown around [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=67.0s)]
*  Frankly, it's rather untrue and insulting [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=73.0s)]
*  Laura Reese leads the Border Security and Immigration Center at the Heritage Foundation [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=76.0s)]
*  A conservative think tank and lobbying group that oversees the controversial Project 2025 [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=81.0s)]
*  If the employers are hiring illegal aliens, that's in violation of the law [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=86.0s)]
*  And those aliens should be removed [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=93.0s)]
*  But removing migrants, like Trump has proposed, could significantly disrupt the food supply chain [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=95.0s)]
*  Consider the meatpacking industry [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=100.0s)]
*  As of 2023, immigrants made up more than 40% of all of its labor [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=102.0s)]
*  And half of those workers were not legally authorized to work in the U.S. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=108.0s)]
*  Our labor situation is already in a tough spot in agriculture [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=112.0s)]
*  Russell Baning is the president of the Texas Farm Bureau, which advocates for farmers and ranchers across the state [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=117.0s)]
*  If those type of products aren't produced in this country and the American consumer wants them, then they're going to have to come from somewhere else [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=123.0s)]
*  We are going to be forced to import our foods, and what is Trump saying about imports? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=131.0s)]
*  Tariffs [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=136.0s)]
*  Mexico has to stop allowing millions of people to pour into our country [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=137.0s)]
*  They can stop them, and we're going to put very serious tariffs on Mexico and Canada [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=141.0s)]
*  Because Canada, they come through Canada too [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=147.0s)]
*  The left uses this as a scare tactic of your price of avocados will skyrocket if we deport illegal aliens is ridiculous [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=150.0s)]
*  National security and sovereignty is a little more important than the cost of guacamole [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=158.0s)]
*  There currently is a legal pathway for farmers to hire migrant labor [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=164.0s)]
*  It's called the H2A Temporary Agricultural Worker Program [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=168.0s)]
*  Through this, migrants can be brought to the U.S. to meet agricultural needs [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=172.0s)]
*  Demand for H2A workers soared by nearly 65% between 2017 and 2022, underscoring agriculture's reliance on migrants for labor [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=176.0s)]
*  Plenty of other agricultural workers have followed the law [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=186.0s)]
*  So why should we give a benefit to the person who has not followed the law, not taken advantage of that program year after year after year? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=189.0s)]
*  But here's the catch [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=196.0s)]
*  The H2A program doesn't really work for every industry since it's seasonal [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=198.0s)]
*  So farms that take care of livestock year-round can't benefit from the program [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=202.0s)]
*  We hope we can get a balance and work with the administration to expand the H2A program where the guest workers come in [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=207.0s)]
*  But they can work in any type of industry, part of agriculture, that's basically year-round [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=214.0s)]
*  But this proposition concerns farm unions [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=221.0s)]
*  One of the problems is that they also want to expand it to year-round and lower the salaries of these workers [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=223.0s)]
*  Which will affect workers who have been working for 10, 20, 30, 40 years [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=232.0s)]
*  Immigration has long been a key concern for voters during presidential elections, particularly in 2024 [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=236.0s)]
*  The biggest threat to your unions is millions of people coming across the border [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=243.0s)]
*  Because you're not going to have your jobs anymore [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=249.0s)]
*  Nearly 82 percent of Trump voters said immigration was a very important issue [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=251.0s)]
*  I understand they're not citizens, but they've also been productive members of society and they haven't been convicted of a felony [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=256.0s)]
*  Can't we figure out a way to have a legal pathway? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=265.0s)]
*  Trump tapped Tom Holman to be the border czar and oversee the mass deportation process [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=268.0s)]
*  Holman, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is a hardliner on illegal immigration [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=273.0s)]
*  I got a message to the millions of illegal immigrants that Joe Biden's released in our country in violation of federal law [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=280.0s)]
*  You better start packing now [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=286.0s)]
*  Trump and Holman both say that the deportations will accomplish two things [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=288.0s)]
*  It will open up more job opportunities for U.S. citizens [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=293.0s)]
*  And it will shut down migrant trafficking networks that might harbor criminals [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=296.0s)]
*  But we're starting with the criminals and we got to do it [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=300.0s)]
*  And then we're starting with others and we're going to see how it goes [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=303.0s)]
*  Who are the others? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=307.0s)]
*  Others are other people outside of criminals [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=308.0s)]
*  We simply cannot sustain the numbers of people who have been let in over the past four years [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=310.0s)]
*  So it is incumbent to get back to the rule of law to enforce the laws that Congress passed [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=317.0s)]
*  Union organizations like United Farm Workers are working to educate members about what to do if a raid happens at their farm [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=323.0s)]
*  What are they going to do if they have a home on their name? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=331.0s)]
*  What are they going to do if they're deported and they have minor children? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=334.0s)]
*  Prepare them for the worst [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=338.0s)]
*  We want to make sure that they understand that they still have the power to defend themselves in their working areas [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=340.0s)]
*  Because without Farm Workers, without this immigrant community, we would not have an agricultural industry [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vRYe2NWSY&t=346.0s)]
