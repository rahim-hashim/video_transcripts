# NTSB Investigator Explains How Over 1,000 Trains Derail Yearly | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY)
*  Seconds, that's all it takes for a train to come off the tracks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=0.0s)]
*  Like this one in Springfield, Ohio. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  It's just one of the around a dozen derailments already reported in 2023, according to the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=8.8s)]
*  Association of American Railroads. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=14.8s)]
*  Over 1,000 trains derail every year. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Every single event that we investigate is preventable. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=20.72s)]
*  And while not all are severe, derailments can happen in many ways. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=24.66s)]
*  Here are some of the biggest reasons trains go off the tracks and what can be done to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=29.32s)]
*  make the system safer. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=34.0s)]
*  Derailments are the most common train accidents in the U.S. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=37.36s)]
*  In 2022, 66% of accidents were classified by the Federal Railroad Administration as [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=40.24s)]
*  derailments. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=46.04s)]
*  That's across all 600-plus railroad companies in the country, in both rail yards, where [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=47.04s)]
*  most derailments happen, and out on the main lines. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  And track issues are one of the biggest causes. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=55.8s)]
*  That can be a track that's too wide, a broken rail, or a warped track. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  Essentially, it's when the track isn't ready for the train. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=64.36s)]
*  Michael Hiller is the deputy director of the Railroad Investigation Office at the NTSB. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=67.84s)]
*  He investigated this 2017 derailment in Grattinger, Iowa, where 20 cars of a Union Pacific train [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=73.0s)]
*  derailed at a bridge. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=79.47999999999999s)]
*  That year, 14% of derailments caused by track issues were because of some sort of a broken [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=81.38s)]
*  track piece. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=87.1s)]
*  The rail broke under the middle of the train. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=88.1s)]
*  There's a portion of the train that's on the other side of the bridge and it's safe, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=91.14s)]
*  but then there's a pile of cars and then behind there's still a bunch of cars that haven't [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=95.02s)]
*  derailed. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=100.17999999999999s)]
*  Some cars released ethanol, causing the train to catch fire. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=101.17999999999999s)]
*  The NTSB found that the track in the area of the derailment was inadequately maintained. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=104.78s)]
*  Every time it hit that zone, it would just pound, pound, and pound that rail until it [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=110.98s)]
*  eventually broke. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=117.5s)]
*  In 2013, a catastrophic derailment in Bridgeport, Connecticut was also caused by a broken track [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=118.5s)]
*  piece. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  A Metro North passenger train derailed and collided with another train, injuring 65 people. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  In this incident, compromised joint bars that connect two different types of rail together [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=131.52s)]
*  were fractured. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=136.38s)]
*  Once that joint bar is broken, there's no longer a structure able to support the safe [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=138.02s)]
*  movement of a train. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  In both cases, the NTSB made recommendations emphasizing track maintenance and inspection, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=145.54000000000002s)]
*  but it's ultimately up to the railroads to implement them. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=151.5s)]
*  In response, Metro North updated its inspection protocol and says it continues to maintain [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=154.94s)]
*  a robust track inspection program. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=159.9s)]
*  And Union Pacific says its inspection and maintenance policies go above and beyond requirements. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=162.46s)]
*  As a track wears, it does require inspection and it does require maintenance. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  And it's that inspection that is really critical to identify what types of interventions [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=173.94s)]
*  are necessary to keep it operating safe. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=180.98000000000002s)]
*  Track isn't the only thing that breaks. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=184.94s)]
*  Among the major freight railroads, equipment failures were the most common cause of mainline [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=187.22s)]
*  derailments in 2022. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=192.18s)]
*  That was the case in the February derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=194.5s)]
*  The NTSB's preliminary report said that an overheated wheel bearing likely caused [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=198.74s)]
*  the Norfolk Southern train to go off the tracks. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=203.62s)]
*  Sparks under a railcar could be seen on surveillance cameras miles before the train derailed. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=206.74s)]
*  38 cars derailed, including 11 that were carrying hazardous materials and caught fire, damaging [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=212.14000000000001s)]
*  12 more. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=218.46s)]
*  The incident rattled the town, angering residents who still worry about damages to the community, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=219.66s)]
*  including fear of possible water contamination. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=225.57999999999998s)]
*  We all just want answers. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=228.7s)]
*  I think that's what everybody here wants is just answers. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=230.94s)]
*  The Environmental Protection Agency has said local drinking water is safe. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  It also ordered Norfolk Southern to clean up the site. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=239.2s)]
*  The railroad also announced new safety initiatives, like adding more temperature sensors to its [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  tracks to alert a train's crew of any trouble before it's too late. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=247.22s)]
*  Inspection and new sensors alone can't prevent all derailments. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=251.62s)]
*  Many are caused by human errors. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=255.66s)]
*  That can mean going too fast, miscommunication, or misaligned switches. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=258.34s)]
*  The NTSB has tried to address human errors, including pushing for safeguards like positive [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=262.66s)]
*  train control. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=267.98s)]
*  PTC is a system that helps to slow and stop trains to prevent accidents like collisions [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=269.38s)]
*  and overspeed derailments. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=275.34s)]
*  In my time, I've had at least four investigations where overspeeding in a curve resulted in [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=277.42s)]
*  a derailment and a very catastrophic outcome. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=285.46s)]
*  In 2008, Congress mandated that every major railroad develop a PTC system in the Rail [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=288.98s)]
*  Safety Improvement Act. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=294.3s)]
*  It took 12 years for all of the railroads to fully implement PTC. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=295.94s)]
*  Rail companies need to stop fighting us every time we try to do a regulation. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=300.94s)]
*  Norfolk Southern's CEO said that the company supports legislative efforts to enhance rail [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=307.18s)]
*  safety. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=311.74s)]
*  In March, a bipartisan group of senators proposed new legislation that would tighten safety [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=312.74s)]
*  regulations and increase fines. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=317.9s)]
*  But pushback is expected. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=320.74s)]
*  Industry Group AAR criticized the proposed legislation, saying some regulations, like [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=322.82s)]
*  crew size requirements, wouldn't prevent future accidents. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=327.9s)]
*  Overall, derailments are happening less frequently than they were a decade ago. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=332.38s)]
*  That's thanks, in part, to advances in rail safety, including positive train control. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=336.53999999999996s)]
*  But for some railroads, the rate of derailments has increased in recent years as they've [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=341.82s)]
*  moved more freight over fewer miles. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=346.5s)]
*  Still, compared to other modes of transportation, train travel is very safe. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=350.09999999999997s)]
*  If you compare highway versus rail, the loss of life is a lot greater on the highway side [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=354.5s)]
*  versus rail. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=360.85999999999996s)]
*  Hiller thinks there can be more improvements when it comes to rail safety. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=361.85999999999996s)]
*  You have to have good maintenance, you have to have good training, you have to have good [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=365.58s)]
*  organizations that really embrace safety as part of its culture. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=369.26s)]
*  It's achievable, but it's going to take a lot of work. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4uvQau7mY&t=373.65999999999997s)]
