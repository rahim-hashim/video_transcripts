# Why China and the U.S. Are Vying for Dominance in Pakistan
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 10, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI)
*  There's a lot of talk about the US-China trade war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=0.0s)]
*  But while you're looking over here, a conflict between the two giants is brewing over here, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=4.88s)]
*  in Pakistan. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=9.76s)]
*  The conflict is about global dominance, and Pakistan's financial security is hanging [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=11.64s)]
*  in the balance. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=16.06s)]
*  If China succeeds, it could be on the path toward becoming the new center of global trade. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=17.88s)]
*  If the US wins, it could frustrate China's latest push to become a global economic superpower. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=22.52s)]
*  Either way, the impact will be felt for decades around the world. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=27.96s)]
*  To understand how we got here, you first have to understand why China is in Pakistan at all. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  China is there to invest in infrastructure, part of an effort to show the region that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  a friendship with China brings tangible economic benefits. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=41.84s)]
*  This falls under China's Belt and Road Initiative, aimed at building up China's global trade [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=45.88s)]
*  network. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=49.84s)]
*  President Xi Jinping started it in 2013, and there are estimates that China plans to spend [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=51.08s)]
*  as much as $1 trillion on infrastructure projects in the next few years, across 68 countries. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=55.64s)]
*  A couple things to know about the Belt and Road Initiative. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=61.88s)]
*  First, many in the US view the Initiative as a threat. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=64.68s)]
*  The US still has the largest GDP in the world, but China is gaining ground. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=68.76s)]
*  Take for example the fact that the US was the largest exporter of goods and services [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=74.08s)]
*  in the world until 2013. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=77.94s)]
*  China passed the US, and the two world powers have been neck and neck ever since. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=80.64s)]
*  The second thing to know is that China is giving huge loans to countries it's investing [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=85.84s)]
*  in for the Belt and Road Initiative, and some recipients are not well positioned to pay [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=89.8s)]
*  them back. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=94.24s)]
*  For example, China funded construction for a Sri Lankan seaport in Hambantota, but when [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=95.54s)]
*  Sri Lanka couldn't afford to repay, it reached a deal to give China the port on a 99-year [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=100.72s)]
*  lease. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=105.44s)]
*  By loaning Sri Lanka money it couldn't afford to pay back, China secured a port on a potentially [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=106.54s)]
*  strategic maritime trade route. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=111.14s)]
*  Some people have dubbed this type of loan debt-trap diplomacy, and worry China could [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=113.72s)]
*  do it again. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=117.94000000000001s)]
*  So where does Pakistan fit into all of this? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=119.98s)]
*  China's biggest Belt and Road project is taking place there. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=122.78s)]
*  The plan is to build up Pakistan's infrastructure on a grand scale. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=126.10000000000001s)]
*  Once completed, China could use these highways, ports, railways, and pipelines for efficient [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=129.78s)]
*  access to the entire Indian Ocean, and continue to supplant the U.S. and Pakistan. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=134.34s)]
*  But for Pakistan, there are a lot of catches. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=139.98000000000002s)]
*  And these catches are driving Pakistan, which is already struggling economically, deeper [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=142.82000000000002s)]
*  and deeper into debt. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=146.82000000000002s)]
*  For example, in one initiative, China is building a series of hydro, wind, and coal power plants. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=148.70000000000002s)]
*  But as part of the agreement, Pakistan has to buy the electricity produced at a price [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=154.96s)]
*  that covers a hefty return on investment, and pay back the debt. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=158.72000000000003s)]
*  The country is already falling behind on payments, giving Chinese authorities more [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=162.8s)]
*  leverage. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=166.52s)]
*  Pakistan is expected to ask the International Monetary Fund for a bailout. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=170.36s)]
*  Experts say they will ask for at least $8 to $12 billion, maybe more. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=174.4s)]
*  But some lawmakers in the U.S. are expressing concern over how that bailout money is going [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=178.78s)]
*  to be used. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=182.84s)]
*  They say that the U.S., as the largest contributor of IMF funding, shouldn't have American taxpayers [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=183.84s)]
*  help Pakistan pay off debt to China. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=190.16s)]
*  But not bailing out Pakistan isn't really an option either. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=193.24s)]
*  It's the IMF's job to help developing countries. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=196.44s)]
*  And if the U.S. doesn't help bail out Pakistan, it could cost the U.S. a close ally and destabilize [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  a geopolitically important country. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=204.06s)]
*  So the U.S. is expected to use this as an opportunity to limit China's influence in Pakistan. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=206.64s)]
*  One way it could do this would be to influence the IMF to place terms on the bailout, such [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=212.72s)]
*  as specific restrictions on borrowing from China. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=216.82s)]
*  This would force Pakistan to significantly scale back Belt and Road projects. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=220.14s)]
*  Pakistan for its part is in a tough spot. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=226.66s)]
*  On one hand, it may need a financial rescue from the IMF, funded in part by the U.S. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=229.06s)]
*  On the other hand, it desperately needs the infrastructure improvements offered by China. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=235.14s)]
*  And the incoming Pakistani administration has added another complication. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=240.18s)]
*  Imran Khan's party stated that it might look for options besides the IMF to help with its debt, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=244.02s)]
*  maybe even borrowing more from China. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=248.74s)]
*  However, Mr. Khan's government has also pledged to make public the Chinese deals, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=251.1s)]
*  shrouded in secrecy up until now. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=255.46s)]
*  If the U.S. comes out on top, it could start to discredit China's Belt and Road initiative. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=258.38s)]
*  Future countries might be hesitant in accepting Belt and Road money, slowing China's expansion. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=262.58s)]
*  If China comes out on top, it's closer to its goal of displacing the U.S. and becoming [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=267.58s)]
*  the new center of global trade. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=271.8s)]
*  These issues will come to head in a few weeks, as Pakistan is rapidly running out of foreign [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=274.04s)]
*  exchange reserves. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=278.24s)]
*  When that time comes, it could amount to a battle between the U.S. and China. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=280.04s)]
*  A battle for the number one spot as a worldwide superpower. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYdqoVJIeI&t=284.40000000000003s)]
