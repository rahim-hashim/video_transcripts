# How to Spend Money on Politics Like a Billionaire
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 02, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU)
*  I think Judge Gorsuch— [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=0.0s)]
*  Ideas that we talk about. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=1.44s)]
*  This year's midterms are shaping up to be the most expensive in history. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=3.92s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=8.64s)]
*  Some of it's because of rich donors. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=9.64s)]
*  Like this one. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=12.56s)]
*  This is Marcy, and she's a billionaire with a cause. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Let's say she wants more bike lanes. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=19.12s)]
*  Everywhere. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=22.28s)]
*  And she's ready to spend $5 million to support politicians who agree with her. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=23.48s)]
*  Marcy has a lot of options for how to spend that money. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=29.92s)]
*  We're going to help her understand them. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=33.6s)]
*  Her first option is the simplest. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  She could give money directly to a candidate who supports bike lanes. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=39.08s)]
*  That contribution is limited to $2,700 per election. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  Or double that if the candidate runs in the primary and general election. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=47.72s)]
*  For Marcy, this contribution is just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=52.8s)]
*  Marcy's second option is leadership packs. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=57.96s)]
*  Many congresspeople—think Paul Ryan, Nancy Pelosi—have established leadership packs. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=61.88s)]
*  These are pools of money that operate outside of a candidate's campaign. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=68.6s)]
*  When leadership packs were approved in the late 70s, the idea was that congresspeople [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=73.12s)]
*  could use the funds to network and gain favor. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=77.2s)]
*  But the lines have blurred. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=80.36s)]
*  And now that money is typically used for travel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=82.2s)]
*  For things that, quote, raise a politician's profile, Marcy can give $5,000 per year to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=85.44s)]
*  each leadership pack for candidates that support bike lanes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=91.84s)]
*  Let's say there are 10 such candidates. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=96.12s)]
*  That's $50,000. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=98.6s)]
*  But Marcy wants to give a lot more than that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=102.0s)]
*  So next, she picks the party that supports bike lanes and gives money to each of their [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=105.84s)]
*  national party accounts. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=110.2s)]
*  These accounts can't give money directly to candidates. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=112.76s)]
*  But they can coordinate with them on how the money is spent. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=116.04s)]
*  Each party has three. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=120.04s)]
*  The overall national committee, the one focused on the House, and the one on the Senate. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  But that's not all. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=126.56s)]
*  In December 2014, Congress passed a bill allowing more money to come in through three add-on [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  accounts. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=133.56s)]
*  Headquarters, election recounts, and conventions. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=134.56s)]
*  Marcy can give this much per year to each of these accounts. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=137.92s)]
*  And this much to each of these. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=141.6s)]
*  Over a two-year cycle, that adds up to over $2 million. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  That's more like it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=149.72s)]
*  But Marcy still has a lot of money left to give. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=151.76s)]
*  So she's taking a look at superpacks. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  This is where things get wild. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  Donors like Marcy, as well as corporations and unions, have no limit the amount of money [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=161.0s)]
*  they can give to superpacks that support a candidate. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=167.0s)]
*  This option was introduced in 2010 with federal and Supreme Court rulings such as Citizens [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=169.96s)]
*  United and a series of advisory opinions by the Federal Election Commission. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=174.84s)]
*  And ever since, a huge bulk of political donations now run through packs with names like Progress [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=180.0s)]
*  Tomorrow and Principles Project. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=186.16s)]
*  So what's the big deal? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=189.12s)]
*  Superpacks are not supposed to donate directly to candidates. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=192.0s)]
*  Or even coordinate on spending. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=195.08s)]
*  But each cycle, candidates and superpacks push the red line a little further out. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=197.16s)]
*  Even with all these benefits, Marcy's not going to give money to a superpack. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=203.52s)]
*  That's because donating millions to a superpack is public record. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=208.84s)]
*  And Marcy's feeling a little shy about her last few million. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=213.0s)]
*  Which leads us to Marcy's final option. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=216.8s)]
*  Donating to a nonprofit. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=219.88s)]
*  Marcy's giving the rest of her $5 million to Bike Lanes for America, a made-up nonprofit [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=222.44s)]
*  that allows her to donate unlimited money to influence her cause and keep her identity [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=228.44s)]
*  secret. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=233.4s)]
*  In turn, Bike Lanes for America can use Marcy's money to try and influence elections. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=234.4s)]
*  Usually through attack ads. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  The catch is that these groups must spend at least 50% on something other than politics. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=243.0s)]
*  These numbers aren't heavily monitored. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=248.96s)]
*  And skeptics question whether some nonprofits are following this rule. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=251.4s)]
*  So now that Marcy's spent all of her money, what's next? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  What's next is that all these different organizations figure out how to spend the money Marcy gave them. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=260.68s)]
*  And for everybody who's not a Marcy, we just get to see more of this. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYG5X8itSzU&t=267.68s)]
