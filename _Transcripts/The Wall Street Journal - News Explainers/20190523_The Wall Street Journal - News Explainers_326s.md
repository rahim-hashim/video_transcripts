# How Tariffs Could Impact Your Home Renovation | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 23, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8)
*  Lighting 15% increases, flooring 10 to 25% if the tariffs go forward. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=0.0s)]
*  This glass door is going up 10%. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=7.86s)]
*  George Abihabib's remodeling business in San Diego is bracing for the new abnormal. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=9.9s)]
*  25% tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on $200 billion in Chinese goods, up from 10% last [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=15.66s)]
*  year. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=23.5s)]
*  Many materials used in home building and remodeling are included. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=24.5s)]
*  We've got a lot of things like granite that are going to be sourced from China. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=27.06s)]
*  Small business owners like Abihabib are worried that potential clients, due to the tariffs [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=31.06s)]
*  on Chinese goods, will balk at soon-to-come higher price quotes. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=35.78s)]
*  It takes a long time for customers to digest the new reality of what things cost. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=40.8s)]
*  And in the meantime, we have a very large overhead and about 50 staff that we need to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=44.96s)]
*  ensure have continual work. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=50.16s)]
*  His concerns are twofold. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=52.4s)]
*  Many homeowners will put off major improvements like getting a new kitchen and that to attract [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=54.199999999999996s)]
*  potential clients, he'll need to reduce his profit margin. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=58.62s)]
*  You're in a position where you could be losing 20 or 30% of your net profits at the end of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=61.82s)]
*  the year. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=65.78s)]
*  You're eating some of the cost, in other words. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=66.78s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=68.26s)]
*  If we can't pass on all of it to the customer, we end up eating it ourselves. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=69.26s)]
*  The alternatives for these are much, much more expensive when they're made in the States. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=73.82s)]
*  Abihabib says his clients prefer higher-end products manufactured in America. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=78.11999999999999s)]
*  But even from these suppliers, he's receiving ominous emails. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  They thank us for our business and they say that our industry is under unprecedented pressure [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=87.16s)]
*  due to tariffs and we've waited as long as we can for possible price increases due to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=91.72s)]
*  these tariffs. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  So this is an American cabinet line, but this is built on engineered wood, part of the Chinese [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=97.16s)]
*  supply chain. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  To give us a better idea of what the new China tariffs will mean for customers, Abihabib [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=104.42s)]
*  takes us to a work site. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=108.48s)]
*  This is the $75,000 kitchen. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  So yeah, as you can see, this is a complete gut job. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=114.04s)]
*  Abihabib says because of the new increased tariffs, he'll need to charge for a renovation [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  like this one, $6,000 more than he did a year ago. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=121.62s)]
*  $6,000 on a $75,000 kitchen is a very big increase. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=126.12s)]
*  Is it a deal breaker? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=130.04s)]
*  It is definitely a deal breaker. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=131.04s)]
*  One of the impacts of the tariff is not simply the price increase, but also the delay in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=133.52s)]
*  investment. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=139.24s)]
*  And the delay in investment will come from consumers, for example, delaying home remodel. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=140.24s)]
*  Renee Bowen, a professor of international trade policy at the University of California, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=145.44s)]
*  San Diego, says the tariffs could be damaging to the U.S. economy. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=149.56s)]
*  It's a big deal. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=153.6s)]
*  It's going to affect U.S. consumers a lot. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=154.6s)]
*  You've been studying tariffs and trade for decades now, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=156.96s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=162.08s)]
*  Have you ever seen anything quite like this? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=163.08s)]
*  Never seen anything like this. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=164.58s)]
*  I've been having to rewrite my classes, essentially. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=165.86s)]
*  The United States would like to think that China will be more hurt by the U.S. tariffs [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=169.06s)]
*  than the U.S. will be hurt by the Chinese tariffs, but that's to be determined. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=174.78s)]
*  I think it's going to turn out extremely well. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=179.22000000000003s)]
*  We're in a very strong position. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=180.9s)]
*  The Trump administration is also taking steps to impose fresh 25 percent tariffs on nearly [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=182.74s)]
*  $300 billion in Chinese goods that aren't currently taxed. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=187.34s)]
*  I think this is a risk we should and can take without damaging our economy in any appreciable way. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=191.68s)]
*  The Trump administration hopes that ultimately a deal with China will be reached that benefits [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=197.4s)]
*  U.S. producers. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=201.88s)]
*  There may be more made in America as a result of the tariffs. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=204.0s)]
*  Consumers now are forced to purchase from domestic producers who have higher prices naturally. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=207.28s)]
*  While producers are enjoying this welfare gain, consumers are losing. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=214.16s)]
*  This tile and flooring store in San Diego primarily serves customers who've got tighter budgets. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=220.06s)]
*  This is our wood-looking luxury vinyl plank, which is one of the most popular items nowadays. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=225.12s)]
*  And where's it from? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=231.24s)]
*  This product is actually a Chinese product. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=232.24s)]
*  Even with the tariff increases on these products on anything out of China, they're still going [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=234.52s)]
*  to be less expensive than an American-made product. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=239.16s)]
*  Even with the 25 percent tariffs? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=242.76s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=244.76s)]
*  The trade war is bad news for everyone, but particularly the middle class and lower income Americans. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=246.18s)]
*  Lower income Americans. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=252.46s)]
*  Lower income Americans benefit from the very cheap products that are coming from China. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=253.46s)]
*  So let's head down over to the warehouse. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=258.3s)]
*  Veronica Tarikas says about 90 percent of the products her company sells come from China. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=260.1s)]
*  So now if you take a look here, you will see made in China here. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=265.14s)]
*  Made in China. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=271.82s)]
*  Tarikas says she's nervous. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=273.3s)]
*  I as a manager have to worry about, for instance, my staff's jobs, our company. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=275.4s)]
*  When the first round of tariffs on Chinese goods hit last fall, she says sales dropped [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=281.2s)]
*  off pretty much immediately. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=285.92s)]
*  We're talking about 33 percent. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=287.68s)]
*  So a third less sales. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=289.8s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=291.08s)]
*  Well, and you're confident that it's because of the tariffs? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=292.08s)]
*  Yes, it was just very, very busy and it came to a screeching halt. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=294.12s)]
*  As soon as the tariffs hit? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=297.64s)]
*  As soon as the tariffs hit. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=298.64s)]
*  And the new increased round is expected to hit soon. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=301.04s)]
*  Products that are already in transit will not be subject to the tariffs. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=304.58s)]
*  But goods being loaded on ships in China now will have to pay the tariff when they arrive. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=308.42s)]
*  So we will see a small delay in the impact of these tariffs, about two weeks. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=313.38s)]
*  But the tariffs are literally on their way. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=318.3s)]
*  Correct, the tariffs are literally on their way. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auRBixO7sk8&t=320.5s)]
