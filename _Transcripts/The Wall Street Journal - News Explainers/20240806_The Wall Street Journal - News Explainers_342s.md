*  Yes, they're weird. They prove that every day. It's an observation. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=12.24s)]
*  Walz is viewed as more of a moderate figure, but someone who has picked up a number of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=15.36s)]
*  progressive causes as governor. He's not somebody who has an extensive [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  fundraising base or is someone who's very well known among the public. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=27.76s)]
*  Walz's ascension comes as Harris has consolidated support among Democrats after President Biden [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=32.88s)]
*  exited the race. Here's a look at what Walz brings as running mate in an election showdown [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  with Donald Trump and J.D. Vance. Tim Walz is a proven winner among rural voters, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  and he's been very successful in Minnesota, which is a state that Republicans are trying to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  put onto the battleground map. Thank you, Minnesota. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=56.56s)]
*  Walz really gives this everyman persona. He's somebody who is very comfortable with farmers. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=59.92s)]
*  He's also someone who can appeal to voters in the suburbs and the cities. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=66.4s)]
*  Hey, Minnesota. Governor Walz here at the Great Minnesota Get Together. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=71.04s)]
*  The 60-year-old governor didn't begin his career in politics. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=74.4s)]
*  He's someone who worked as a school teacher for more than two decades. He also spent time [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=78.4s)]
*  in the military. So he really brings to the table a background of someone who had an entirely [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=85.6s)]
*  different life before he entered politics. Walz was first elected to Congress in 2006, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=92.16s)]
*  managing to unseat a six-term Republican in one of the state's more conservative districts. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  He was supportive of a number of issues related to agriculture. He also served as a leader on [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=103.36s)]
*  veterans' affairs issues, given his extensive background in the Army Reserves. Walz was once [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=110.72s)]
*  given an A rating from the National Rifle Association. After the Parkland shooting in 2018, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=116.88s)]
*  he quickly pivoted to support background checks, and the NRA disavowed many of his proposals. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=122.72s)]
*  After 12 years in Congress, Walz ran for Minnesota governor in 2018 as someone who could compromise [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=130.0s)]
*  with Republicans. He won by more than 11 percentage points. Hello, One Minnesota. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=135.6s)]
*  Walz was re-elected in 2022 and a year later oversaw a Democratic-controlled state legislature [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=143.12s)]
*  with a progressive agenda. He helped get through a program to provide universal school meals [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=148.72s)]
*  for children. He was supportive of codifying abortion rights. He was supportive of the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=154.32s)]
*  legalization of recreational marijuana. He was viewed as somebody who was very progressive on [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=160.88s)]
*  climate change, the environment, and also in promoting infrastructure spending. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=166.96s)]
*  Walz was criticized for his handling of the civic unrest following the murder of George [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis in 2020. I'm authorizing and talking to General Jensen [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  to fully mobilize the Minnesota National Guard, an action that has never been taken in the 164-year [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=184.32s)]
*  history of the Minnesota National Guard. Walz deployed the National Guard three days after [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=189.36s)]
*  Floyd's murder. In July, the governor signed a police reform bill banning the use of chokeholds [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  in most cases and requiring other officers to intervene when another is using excessive force. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=203.28s)]
*  In the aftermath of George Floyd's murder, he faced some criticism that he did not act quickly [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=209.44000000000003s)]
*  enough to quell some of the violence that we saw on the streets of the city. There was criticism [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=215.28s)]
*  that he didn't quickly bring in the National Guard to restore order. In recent weeks, Walz has [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  repeatedly used one word to describe Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance. Yeah, they're weird and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=229.28s)]
*  I am not changing that. I see Donald Trump talking about the wonderful Hannibal Lecter or whatever [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=235.2s)]
*  weird thing he's on tonight. That is weird behavior. And it seems to have caught on. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=239.92s)]
*  By the way, don't you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=244.64s)]
*  In the lead-up to his selection as Harris's running mate, he really showed a penchant [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=251.2s)]
*  for being the attack dog, namely his appearances on some of the Sunday shows, some of the cable TV [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=256.08s)]
*  hits that he did attacking J.D. Vance. People like J.D. Vance know nothing about small town America. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=262.47999999999996s)]
*  Although no Republican presidential candidate has won over Minnesota voters since Richard Nixon, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=268.32s)]
*  the Trump campaign wants to compete there. Minnesota is a state that Democrats really [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=273.52s)]
*  can't lose. Trump got very close in 2016 and has since then always tried to put the state into play. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=278.64s)]
*  He and Vance have made appearances recently in the state and they view it as a place where they could [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=287.6s)]
*  perhaps cut into the Democratic battleground map. The Harris-Walls ticket and its platform will take [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=294.32s)]
*  center stage in Chicago during the week of August 19th when the Democratic National Convention [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=300.96s)]
*  convenes to cement their nominations. Walls helps neutralize J.D. Vance's appeal to rural voters, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=306.32s)]
*  especially those voters in the Midwest, some of the states that will help determine the election. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=314.08s)]
*  We expect Walls to give an address at the Democratic National Convention. That'll really [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=320.32s)]
*  be his first opportunity to give the American people a window into his life, his career, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=324.96s)]
*  his background, and that will be an important showcase for him before Democrats. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5P0F5aBUz8&t=331.68s)]
