Video Description: It appears Congress is poised to avert a government shutdown just hours before the deadline. In every other country, if a government agency doesn’t have a budget for the new year, they just use last year’s. But in the U.S., Congress needs to pass a new budget every single year or agencies have to shut down.

Add in the lack of other opportunities to pass laws, a dysfunctional budget process and polarizing politics and… you have the threat of Congress not completing their most basic task nearly every year. WSJ explains.

# Why the Threat of Government Shutdowns Keeps Happening | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI)
*  It seems like every year there's a real threat of a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=0.0s)]
*  government shutdown. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=3.04s)]
*  Lawmakers racing to reach a deal to avoid a government shutdown. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=4.04s)]
*  And 2023 is no different. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Saturday, 1159 p.m. deadline to avoid a government shutdown. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=8.68s)]
*  Here's why the government is constantly on the verge of a shutdown. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  For starters, the U.S. is the only country that even can shut down. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=17.2s)]
*  Everywhere else, if a government agency doesn't have a budget for the new fiscal year, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=21.64s)]
*  they just use last year's and keep working. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=25.72s)]
*  But because 150 years ago, a bunch of U.S. agencies would blow through their entire budget, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=28.72s)]
*  or appropriations, in a few months, Congress passed the Anti-Deficiency Act, saying it [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=34.04s)]
*  wasn't lawful to spend any sum in excess of appropriations made by Congress for that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=40.0s)]
*  fiscal year. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=45.32s)]
*  Basically, if Congress doesn't pass a new funding bill every year, agencies can't [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=46.32s)]
*  spend a dime and shut down. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=50.92s)]
*  But why that keeps threatening to happen a century later comes down to Congress. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=53.88s)]
*  For one, these spending bills are kind of their big thing. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=59.14s)]
*  The one thing that Congress has to do with the president is write the bills to keep the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=62.52s)]
*  government open and working. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=69.2s)]
*  There are a lot of measures that should be done or could be done, but this is the be-all [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  end-all of must-pass. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=77.16s)]
*  So these spending bills end up becoming a vessel for all kinds of other things, like [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=79.64s)]
*  last year's. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=84.4s)]
*  Sure, it funded things like the Department of Agriculture and Energy and the Department [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=85.4s)]
*  of Defense, but it also created the Alaska Salmon Research Task Force, renamed a bunch [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=89.24s)]
*  of post offices, and changed policy on the protection of whales in the North Atlantic, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=95.1s)]
*  which environmental activists were adamantly opposed to. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  Other things are going to catch a ride, and that's sort of the reality of living in a [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=103.74000000000001s)]
*  world where Congress struggles to legislate. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=107.48s)]
*  She isn't exaggerating. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=110.72s)]
*  This is the number of laws that each session of Congress has enacted. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=112.36s)]
*  Not only is Congress trending towards fewer and fewer laws, but so far this session, they're [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=116.36s)]
*  off to a really slow start. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  They're on pace to not even create 100. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=124.04s)]
*  If there's so few things that make it to the floor, it's the target. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=126.48s)]
*  It's your opportunity to make a stand. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  It makes it harder and harder to reach those agreements in the first place. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=134.14s)]
*  In theory, they should be reaching those agreements with something called a budget resolution [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=138.5s)]
*  by about mid-April, but that hasn't happened in 20 years. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=142.89999999999998s)]
*  Then they're supposed to pass those spending bills by the new fiscal year deadline, October [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=147.5s)]
*  1st. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=151.38s)]
*  Here's how many spending bills have been passed by then. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=152.38s)]
*  It's been 26 years since all of them were done on time. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=155.1s)]
*  They usually pass a short-term stopgap funding bill, or a continuing resolution, to fund [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=159.54s)]
*  the government for just a little bit. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=164.57999999999998s)]
*  And that's why it's seemingly that we come back in December quite frequently, and that's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=166.85999999999999s)]
*  when the rubber hits the road for actually compiling all these final decisions on spending bills. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=172.82s)]
*  The ideological divide in Congress is growing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=179.29999999999998s)]
*  Republicans are more conservative, Democrats are more liberal, and then there's few members [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=182.54s)]
*  who meet somewhere in the middle. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=187.88s)]
*  Polarization exacerbates difficulties in the process here. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  You can see it in split districts, too, where voters elected a representative from one party [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=193.62s)]
*  and voted the opposite party for president. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=198.29999999999998s)]
*  Today, Congress has one of the fewest numbers of split districts in the last hundred years. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=201.4s)]
*  It reinforces partisanship. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=206.88s)]
*  It makes it harder to reach final agreements where you have to reach across the party line, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=208.76s)]
*  and it creates an incentive for speakers like McCarthy never to want to deal with the Democrats [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=214.28s)]
*  but to deliver on behalf of his party's conference, not on behalf of what the Democrats want. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=220.12s)]
*  So a disorganized budget process plus a lack of opportunity to debate things plus a lack [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  of motivation to compromise on those things means funding the government is unsurprisingly [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  a battle. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=236.56s)]
*  Look, I'm working everything we can to make sure this doesn't happen. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXr0ZTUFYxI&t=237.56s)]
