# From ‘Bloodbath’ to ‘Vermin:’ Analyzing Trump’s Rhetorical Tactics | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI)
*  I'm calling on Crooked Joe, corrupt attorney general of New York, deranged Jack Smith, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=0.0s)]
*  bird brain, I mean, Nicky becomes president. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=5.68s)]
*  Donald Trump has never shied away from incendiary rhetoric. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=8.24s)]
*  Now if I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=11.52s)]
*  In recent months, Trump has attacked immigrants, political opponents, and even warned of chaos [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=14.76s)]
*  if he were to lose the presidential election this year. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=19.52s)]
*  I don't think you're going to have another election in this country if we don't win this election. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=22.6s)]
*  Trump has increasingly used kind of tough language. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=26.6s)]
*  He's gone off for his critics even more intensely than he had in the past. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  He's discovered that there is a segment of the population that responds to inflammatory rhetoric. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=32.52s)]
*  And he's tapped in to that segment. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=38.08s)]
*  Here's a look at Trump's rhetorical tactics and why it could be both effective for his campaign [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=40.84s)]
*  and dangerous for the people he attacks. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=46.08s)]
*  Trump, from the very moment he descended the escalator at Trump Tower in 2015 to announce [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=50.0s)]
*  his candidacy for president, which many saw as a long shot, he immediately began with [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=56.84s)]
*  some tough rhetoric about immigrants. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=61.96s)]
*  They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=64.08s)]
*  He recognizes the political benefits of using rhetoric that might be more inflammatory than [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=71.16s)]
*  other people use. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=77.04s)]
*  Kurt Braddock researches how communication techniques influence social behavior. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  We need to recognize that just because something is legal and something is protected by the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=83.16s)]
*  First Amendment, we can't ignore the repercussions of that language. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=86.8s)]
*  Fast forward to this election season. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=90.48s)]
*  While discussing immigration at a rally in New Hampshire on December 16, Trump used this language. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=92.88s)]
*  They're poisoning the blood of our country. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=98.64s)]
*  Which many say echoed the manifesto of Nazi party leader Adolf Hitler. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=100.84s)]
*  Then, at a rally on December 19th. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=105.88s)]
*  They're destroying the blood of our country. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=108.2s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  They're destroying our country. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  They don't like it when I said that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  And I never read Mein Kampf. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=114.84s)]
*  They said, oh, Hitler said that in a much different way. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=117.28s)]
*  On April 2nd, at a campaign event in Michigan, Trump used dehumanizing terms to describe [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=121.0s)]
*  immigrants who enter the country illegally. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=126.84s)]
*  They're not humans. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=129.0s)]
*  They're not humans. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=130.0s)]
*  They're animals. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=130.76s)]
*  And later that day, at a rally in Wisconsin. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=131.56s)]
*  On day one, we will terminate every open borders policy of the Biden administration and begin [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=134.4s)]
*  the largest domestic deportation operation in American history, starting with all of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=140.76000000000002s)]
*  the criminals that are pouring in. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=146.68s)]
*  Though illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border have set records of the past few years, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=149.08s)]
*  decades of research has found that immigrants are less likely than native-born Americans [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=154.4s)]
*  to commit crimes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=158.72000000000003s)]
*  One study conducted by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison using data [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=160.44s)]
*  from the Texas Department of Public Safety found that between 2012 and 2018, U.S.-born [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=165.32s)]
*  citizens in the state were over two times more likely to be arrested for violent crimes [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=170.96s)]
*  than undocumented immigrants. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=175.68s)]
*  Although Donald Trump and those like him aren't calling overtly for violence against immigrants, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=178.16s)]
*  by dehumanizing them and by making them seem as though they're one large mass and not [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=184.12s)]
*  a group of individuals. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=188.48s)]
*  We call that deindividuation. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=189.8s)]
*  When we do that, we make individuals more viable targets for violence because we take [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  away their humanity and it's easier to perform violence against individuals who aren't, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=197.24s)]
*  quote, human. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to the journal's questions regarding the former [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=203.56s)]
*  president's comments. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  Trump acknowledged his use of inflammatory language in a March interview with Fox News. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  If you don't use certain rhetoric, if you don't use certain words that maybe are not [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  very nice words, nothing will happen. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=219.56s)]
*  Trump's attacks extend beyond immigration. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=223.28s)]
*  The communists, Marxists, fascists, and the radical left thugs that live like vermin. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=225.96s)]
*  He has gone after judges, court staff, and prosecutors, leading to gag orders in three [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=232.4s)]
*  different legal cases. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=236.96s)]
*  A lot of it does stem from the investigations he faces over January 6 and other matters. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=238.68s)]
*  Trump has really come to view the January 6 events and his supporters differently over [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=245.92s)]
*  the months. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=251.6s)]
*  He's gone from being somewhat critical of some of those who caused damage and did unlawful [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=252.6s)]
*  things to more generally casting them all as patriots. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=257.44s)]
*  They ought to release the J6 hostages. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=262.32s)]
*  They've suffered enough. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=265.84s)]
*  One thing that Trump does very well is to appeal to his base and pull on individuals [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=267.32s)]
*  into his base. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=271.76s)]
*  So he does have this populist rhetoric strategy down to a T. He's very, very good at that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=272.92s)]
*  At a rally in Ohio on March 16, Trump said, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=278.6s)]
*  We're going to put a 100 percent tariff on every single car that comes across the line [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=282.32s)]
*  and you're not going to be able to sell those cars. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=287.6s)]
*  If I get elected, now if I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=289.88s)]
*  that's going to be the least of it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=295.6s)]
*  It's going to be a bloodbath for the country. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=296.88s)]
*  That'll be the least of it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=298.68s)]
*  When individuals, when they admire a politician or they're ideologically aligned with a politician, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  if that politician makes a statement that even implicitly advocates for the use of violence, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=306.79999999999995s)]
*  it does a couple of things. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=311.79999999999995s)]
*  Number one, it improves the person's attitudes about the use of violence as a means of political [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  expression. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=318.35999999999996s)]
*  Number two, it normalizes the use of violence, meaning that people think others will engage [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=319.35999999999996s)]
*  in violence as well. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=323.47999999999996s)]
*  And finally, just as importantly, it makes people feel as though that if they use violence, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=324.79999999999995s)]
*  it would be a viable means of achieving political change. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=329.4s)]
*  A Wall Street Journal poll conducted in March found that Trump is leading President Biden [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  in six of the seven most competitive states in the 2024 election. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  According to the poll, Trump holds double digit leads in all seven states when voters [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=341.32s)]
*  are asked who can best handle the economy, immigration and border security. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=345.96s)]
*  Trump's comments really kind of cut two different ways. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=351.64s)]
*  Among his supporters, they can't hear enough of it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=354.52s)]
*  They like him being unvarnished, tough. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=358.0s)]
*  Have no choice. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=360.04s)]
*  The Republican electorate, or rather the Republican elected officials and party leaders across [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=362.04s)]
*  the country are less enamored with that view. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=368.56s)]
*  And a lot of them are skittish about how that's going to affect their own races and just the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=371.84s)]
*  party they've seen the past few cycles that Republicans have done poorly. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=376.28s)]
*  Democrats, on the other hand, have seized on Trump's rhetoric to warn about threats [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=380.68s)]
*  of civil unrest. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=384.64s)]
*  This guy denies January 6th. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=386.48s)]
*  Listen. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=389.12s)]
*  Listen to what he says. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=390.12s)]
*  Every bit of protected speech should remain that way, but we also have to be cognizant [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=391.72s)]
*  and recognize that rhetoric, language, it matters. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=397.56s)]
*  Just because something can be done, or something can be done within the confines of the law, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=402.8s)]
*  doesn't mean that it doesn't have negative repercussions. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=408.24s)]
*  And we've seen that again and again and again. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtdF3HwVrI&t=411.32s)]
