# Why Everything Is On Sale: The Bullwhip Effect | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo)
*  If it seems like there are more sales than usual, it's because there are. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=0.0s)]
*  Simply, these stores have too much stuff. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=4.64s)]
*  It's been the talk of many retailers' earnings calls. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=7.2s)]
*  I would say there's going to be a hesitation called a bloodbath, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=10.0s)]
*  but it's going to be ugly in terms of the amount of discounting and markdowns. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=14.32s)]
*  These big inventories aren't just a good deal for your closet, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=21.36s)]
*  they're a classic example of the bullwhip effect. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=24.88s)]
*  Here's why these stores have such large inventories, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=28.8s)]
*  and what all these sales mean for the economy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=31.44s)]
*  Nothing shows the problem more clearly than this chart. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=35.68s)]
*  It's the ratio between inventories and sales for general retailers, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=38.8s)]
*  places like Walmart or Macy's. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=42.8s)]
*  For the last several years, retailers have been pretty good at keeping just a bit more [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  inventory than sales. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=49.44s)]
*  It's a good balance of keeping enough stock on hand to not have bare shelves, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=51.44s)]
*  but not wasting money to store too much extra inventory. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=55.52s)]
*  And then, of course, COVID happened. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=60.32s)]
*  But after a year of supply chain issues, the economy began to recover, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=65.28s)]
*  and inventories got slightly back to normal. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=69.2s)]
*  Yet today... [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=72.16s)]
*  It's like an echocardiogram for a patient who goes into shock. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  We had really fast economic growth in 2021, and part of that growth was building up inventories. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=77.76s)]
*  What a lot of companies discovered was they built up too much, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=83.92s)]
*  and in some cases they built up inventories of the wrong stuff. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=87.44s)]
*  Retail experts say the buildup is partly because the stores wrongly planned that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=91.84s)]
*  consumers would keep up their pandemic-level spending, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=96.08s)]
*  and partly because of that bullwhip effect. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  Think back to 2020, when demand for athleisure wear was high. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  Stuck in quarantine, people stocked up on yoga and sweatpants. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=108.4s)]
*  You know, I'm kind of happy with my Target yoga pants lately, working from home. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=112.24s)]
*  So retailers placed more orders for lounge apparel with the wholesalers, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=118.0s)]
*  who then placed more orders with the manufacturers, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=122.0s)]
*  who then placed more orders with their suppliers. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  The further down the line this chain went, the demand got larger and larger. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  And by the time the pants could be passed back down the line and fill the racks at the stores, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=133.68s)]
*  the demand just wasn't there. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=138.64s)]
*  They ordered stuff that took a really long time to get there because of all the supply chain issues [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=140.48s)]
*  they had. And then they discovered that the stuff that they had ordered from the overseas suppliers [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=145.92s)]
*  was no longer what a lot of consumers wanted to buy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  Replace yoga pants with air fryers and big TVs. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=153.76s)]
*  And add inflation, which has caused people to shift their spending. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  The inventory bullwhips that we're seeing are very uneven across industries. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=160.88s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons why inflation is very uneven right now. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=166.48s)]
*  In the mid-1900s, inventories were a driver of recessions, mainly because a lot of things were made in the U.S. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=169.84s)]
*  Too much inventory meant stores would place fewer orders. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=177.04s)]
*  So plants would slow production, the other side of the bullwhip. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=180.32s)]
*  When they cut production, they laid off workers. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=184.0s)]
*  Workers spent less. We went into a recession and you had this kind of easily defined business cycle. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=186.96s)]
*  Well, so because the economy has changed so much, because we import a lot of what we [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=192.24s)]
*  consume from overseas, because there's these just-in-time inventories, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=197.44s)]
*  it's hard to say how the bullwhip is going to play out this time. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  Instead of hitting the United States, hit other countries like China. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=206.4s)]
*  China's economy is really struggling right now. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=209.44s)]
*  And this might be part of that story. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=212.0s)]
*  So how should we feel about these sales? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=215.12s)]
*  If everything is on sale, is it good because it could bring down inflation? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  Or is it not good because businesses are losing money, which could lead into a recession? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=222.08s)]
*  On the one hand, it's good news for many individuals because they get cheaper stuff. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=227.36s)]
*  In some ways, it's good news for businesses because they're clearing out their inventories. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  But it could also be bad news because it's a process that can feed on itself. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=238.32s)]
*  It could hurt corporate profits. It could drive down stock prices. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=241.84s)]
*  This is the inherent tension in a market-driven economy. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=245.84s)]
*  There's always two hands. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=248.96s)]
*  These sales are likely to continue throughout the year. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=250.88s)]
*  A reprieve from inflation many shoppers are eager to take advantage of. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=253.36s)]
*  But the bullwhip hasn't had its final snap yet. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnxWVKhObo&t=257.6s)]
