Video Description: President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to pardon “many” participants who have been charged in the Jan. 6 riot. Of the more than 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants, all have been charged with some form of trespassing or disorderly conduct and more than a third have been charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement. Some, like Joseph Biggs, a leader of the Proud Boys, are already lobbying for pardons. 

WSJ spoke to experts and those involved in the day on what it would take for Trump to follow through on that promise.

# What a Trump Pardon of Jan. 6 Rioters Would Mean for U.S. Politics  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4)
*  I was up here, one of those officers up there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=0.0s)]
*  I was armed with a rifle that day, so I didn't want to go down in the crowd and potentially [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=8.0s)]
*  have it used or taken. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=11.6s)]
*  If these are the people that are going to be getting pardons, can you look at this and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=13.64s)]
*  just say they deserve one? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=19.0s)]
*  I don't see how. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=20.48s)]
*  But President-elect Donald Trump has indicated that he might do just that. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=22.76s)]
*  First day. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  You can issue these pardons. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=29.24s)]
*  These people have been there, how long is it, three or four years? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=30.84s)]
*  Pardons are one of the president's greatest powers, but also biggest political liabilities. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=34.04s)]
*  That's what they are, is hostages. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=39.44s)]
*  They've been treated terribly. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=41.48s)]
*  He created expectations, created a movement of people, created a mob that acted, and then [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=43.16s)]
*  walked away. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=48.12s)]
*  I hope he doesn't walk away from these promises. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=49.12s)]
*  Here's what Trump would have to do to carry out those promises and what it means for the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=51.04s)]
*  people involved in the January 6th attack. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=55.56s)]
*  So I still served at the Capitol for three years after the insurrection. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  I left a run for Congress in a fight to continue to hold Donald Trump accountable. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=69.12s)]
*  When I was unsuccessful, I became a surrogate for first Joe Biden and then switching over [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=73.72s)]
*  to Kamala Harris. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=78.72s)]
*  I think that anybody who had anything to do with the incidents of that day need to be [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=79.92s)]
*  held accountable. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=86.2s)]
*  Of the nearly 1,600 January 6th defendants, all have been charged with some form of trespassing [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=87.2s)]
*  or disorderly conduct, and more than a third have been charged with crimes involving assaulting, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=93.48s)]
*  resisting or obstructing law enforcement. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=99.24s)]
*  What we went through that day wasn't normal, and we shouldn't normalize it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=101.84s)]
*  A spokeswoman for Trump's transition team said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=107.0s)]
*  that Trump will pardon Americans who were denied due process and unfairly prosecuted [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  by the weaponized Department of Justice. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=116.88s)]
*  I know the system. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  The system is a very corrupt system. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=120.55999999999999s)]
*  She also said in a separate statement that pardons will happen on a case-by-case basis, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=122.96s)]
*  but didn't give any details on who might receive them or when. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  A number of people accused in the attack are already lobbying the president-elect for pardons. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=131.84s)]
*  One is Joseph Biggs, a leader of the far-right group the Proud Boys, which played a central [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  role in the Capitol riot. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=143.04s)]
*  He can be seen at the Capitol in footage from that day. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=144.84s)]
*  We're on the concrete side, the east side of the Capitol front steps. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=147.84s)]
*  Biggs was found guilty of seditious conspiracy, along with several other charges. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=153.28s)]
*  Report records state that he and other group members helped recruit and lead a crowd that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=158.4s)]
*  breached the Capitol. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=163.04s)]
*  Our streets! [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=164.44s)]
*  Our streets! [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=165.44s)]
*  Biggs is currently serving a 17-year sentence. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=166.44s)]
*  Biggs, what you gotta say? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=169.72s)]
*  Get the f*** out of here! [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  Dear Mr. President. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=172.36s)]
*  His lawyer, Norm Pattis, sent Trump a letter a week after the election. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=173.84s)]
*  You are now in a position to close a painful chapter in American history. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  On behalf of Joe Biggs, I am urging you to do so by granting Mr. Biggs' request for a [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=182.12s)]
*  complete pardon for his actions that day. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=186.4s)]
*  I've heard all sorts of hand-wringing about January 6th. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=189.52s)]
*  I mean, prosecutors, judges referring to it as an attack on the citadel of democracy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=193.0s)]
*  But January 6th wasn't an incendiary event. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=198.88s)]
*  It was one afternoon's riot. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  There were some injuries. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=205.0s)]
*  There was a little bit of property damage. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=206.0s)]
*  Our national pride was wounded, and the peaceful transition of power was imperiled for an [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=210.0s)]
*  hour or two. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=214.92s)]
*  And for this, we're going to fill the prisons. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  The prosecutions have necessarily focused on the actions of the individuals charged, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=219.04s)]
*  not the collect with harm done by the thousands of people who were simultaneously committing [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  crimes that day. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=228.56s)]
*  The idea behind a pardon is that the criminal justice system sometimes gets it wrong and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=230.83999999999997s)]
*  can be quite harsh. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=236.88s)]
*  And there needs to be a fail-safe mechanism to ensure injustices are addressed. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=238.76s)]
*  Kim Whaley is a law professor who wrote a book on the history of pardon power. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=246.0s)]
*  She says the modern pardon process usually works like this. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=250.32s)]
*  There is, within the Department of Justice, an Office of the Pardon Attorney. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=254.24s)]
*  Someone who is seeking a pardon or commutation fills out the form. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=258.42s)]
*  It has a bunch of criteria that include acceptance of responsibility, for example. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=262.48s)]
*  Those pardon attorneys sort through about 10,000 for every four-year presidential term, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=267.66s)]
*  make recommendations to the president, and the president can either accept or reject. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  The presidents can bypass this process entirely, which also bypasses application guidelines, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=278.48s)]
*  like one that states convicts are only eligible five years after the end of their sentence. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=284.48s)]
*  Those aren't constitutional requirements. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=289.16s)]
*  Those are Justice Department requirements. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=291.34s)]
*  And forgive me if I'm a little cynical about the Justice Department. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=293.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm not going to the same fox who locked me up saying, can you open the chicken coop [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=296.58s)]
*  door? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=301.29999999999995s)]
*  While not all pardons that bypass the typical process are controversial, presidents from [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=302.29999999999995s)]
*  both sides of the aisle have issued controversial pardons this way, some that left a lasting [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=306.38s)]
*  mark on their presidencies. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=311.38s)]
*  Typically presidents get in trouble when they don't follow any sort of justice department [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=313.58s)]
*  process. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=318.26s)]
*  Joe Biden is a Republican strategist who worked for Marco Rubio. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=319.26s)]
*  When a president uses a pardon to explicitly benefit a political donor or friend, something [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=322.53999999999996s)]
*  that your average citizen wouldn't be considered for, that rubs people the wrong way. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=330.06s)]
*  Trump issued a number of pardons this way during his first term. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=335.5s)]
*  Did the pardon of Sheriff Joseph Arpaio go through the pardon attorney office? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=338.9s)]
*  I don't believe it did. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=343.14s)]
*  And President Joe Biden recently issued a broad pardon of his son Hunter for tax evasion [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=345.26s)]
*  and lying about drug use. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=350.38s)]
*  Biden had previously said, have you ruled out a pardon for your son? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=352.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=356.7s)]
*  Nobody likes paying taxes and you shouldn't get a pass if you're a president's son. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=358.26s)]
*  And I think Biden's pardons help the J-6 case. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=361.94s)]
*  I think the fact that Biden has so aggressively used his pardon powers in the final months [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=365.9s)]
*  of his presidency clearly makes it easier for Trump to similarly use the pardon powers [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=370.32s)]
*  as he assumes the presidency. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=375.32s)]
*  For no other reason, Republicans will be able to point back at what Biden did and to say [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=377.44s)]
*  Trump is no worse than Biden. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=382.53999999999996s)]
*  But for Trump, the potential ramifications of January 6 pardons are difficult to predict. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=384.96s)]
*  We've never had an event like January 6. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  So I think, you know, pardoning the people that were part of it would be unprecedented [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=393.38s)]
*  by nature. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=396.4s)]
*  This is a groundbreaking concept of pardoning people who violently stormed the Capitol to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=398.28000000000003s)]
*  try and wrest power from a legitimate government and hand it to the loser of an election. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=406.44s)]
*  A pardon kind of, this may not be the word, but it excuses that behavior or it says, it's [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  okay. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=421.52s)]
*  So what is to stop them from doing something like that again? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=422.52s)]
*  And it's unclear what kind of pushback Trump will receive within Washington. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=425.24s)]
*  I think members of Congress have a very different perspective on January 6 than Donald Trump [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=429.76s)]
*  because a lot of them were there. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=433.24s)]
*  They remember what happened that day and some of them are scarred by it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=435.40000000000003s)]
*  And so I don't think that they're going to be cheering Donald Trump's pardons, but they [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=438.6s)]
*  also aren't in a position to fight it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=442.76s)]
*  But those J-6 warriors, they were warriors, but they were really more than anything else. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=444.64s)]
*  They're victims of what happened. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=449.04s)]
*  One of the questions I have is whether there will be a blanket pardon, an amnesty pardon, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=450.92s)]
*  or whether there will be selective pardons based on perceived loyalty. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=456.52000000000004s)]
*  I would say it will be a large portion of them, you know. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=461.16s)]
*  They did a very... [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=464.72s)]
*  And it will be very early on. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=465.72s)]
*  Joe Biggs risked his life for this country and was injured, awarded a Purple Heart, and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=471.20000000000005s)]
*  he lost his pension for participating in a riot. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYRweJr7hd4&t=475.76s)]
