# Cold War 2.0? The Global Economic Impact of Sanctions Against Russia  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E)
*  I'm announcing the first tranche of sanctions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=0.0s)]
*  These sanctions are a major step. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=2.32s)]
*  And we hold further sanctions at readiness to be deployed. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=4.88s)]
*  This is about as close to global economic war as we've ever come. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=9.36s)]
*  Compared to all historical campaigns, this is taking sanctions to the limit. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=12.8s)]
*  The economy is tanking. The ruble has fallen through the floor. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=17.52s)]
*  Inflation is soaring. Interest rates are up. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=21.2s)]
*  The Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered a global economic response [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=25.04s)]
*  without precedent in terms of its speed, scale and scope. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=29.04s)]
*  The sanctions we imposed have generated two-thirds of the world joining us. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=32.8s)]
*  They are profound sanctions. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=37.28s)]
*  The European Union and its partners are working to cripple Putin's ability [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=39.04s)]
*  to finance his war machine. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=43.68s)]
*  In a matter of days, the U.S., the U.K., the EU and others essentially unplugged [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=46.0s)]
*  the world's 11th largest economy from the global economic system. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  We have never applied such deep, severe and far-reaching sanctions [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=55.44s)]
*  on such a large country. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=60.4s)]
*  Vladimir Putin himself has called it a declaration of war. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=62.48s)]
*  And in economic terms, he's not far off. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=65.28s)]
*  But will this financial assault on the Russian economy actually achieve its goal [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=67.44s)]
*  of pressuring Russian President Vladimir Putin to call off his troops? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=72.24s)]
*  The big gamble right now is to see if the West can bankrupt Russia enough [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=76.4s)]
*  that they cannot fight an insurgency. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=81.68s)]
*  Moreover, what will be the consequences of this economic war for everyday Russians? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=83.76s)]
*  And how will this conflict affect the U.S. economy and the lives of everyday Americans? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=88.48s)]
*  In 1990, just months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=95.2s)]
*  Russia's first McDonald's opened in Moscow, a sign that the nation was joining the global economy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  But on March 8th of this year, the chain announced that it would be closing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=105.44s)]
*  all of its restaurants in Russia temporarily. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  It definitely feels like a new Iron Curtain is coming down between East and West. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=112.4s)]
*  I mean, back during the Cold War, it was taken for granted that the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=115.76s)]
*  Soviet Bloc and the Western Bloc did not trade with each other. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=118.72s)]
*  And we're in some sense returning to that world. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  The first move was made by Western governments when they targeted Russia's banking system [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  by blocking the Russian Central Bank from selling its foreign currency reserves. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  We will stop Putin from using his war chest. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=133.6s)]
*  Perhaps the most severe impact has been the seizing of the assets of the Central Bank of Russia. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=137.2s)]
*  Basically, Putin put away a lot of money for a rainy day [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  to help him weather the storms of future sanctions episodes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  Sanctions sent the value of the ruble to an all-time low against the dollar. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  Prices for Russia's most important exports, like natural gas, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=161.76s)]
*  nickel and wheat, shot up to record highs. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=165.44s)]
*  The US, the EU, the UK and Canada removed some Russian banks from SWIFT, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=168.32s)]
*  the financial messaging network used by banks across the globe. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=174.16s)]
*  Additional sanctions included blacklisting Russia's biggest banks from the global financial system, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=178.0s)]
*  legislation to freeze Russian oligarch wealth abroad, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=183.52s)]
*  This is not an economic crime bill. It's an economic warfare bill. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=186.72s)]
*  and export restrictions for certain technologies. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=191.28s)]
*  We estimate that we'll cut off more than half of Russia's high-tech imports. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=194.96s)]
*  This economic war may have begun with government sanctions, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=199.04s)]
*  but as the conflict has continued, private companies and investors [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=202.4s)]
*  have begun to voluntarily sever ties with Russia. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  Many Western companies, without being forced to, are simply, you know, packing up and leaving Russia. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=209.04s)]
*  We're seeing, even though in theory Russian oil and gas is exempt from sanctions, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=215.04s)]
*  many market participants simply don't want to do business with Russian oil and gas. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=219.68s)]
*  Some Western companies decided to suspend operations in Russia, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  while others decided to pull out entirely. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=229.12s)]
*  For everyday Russians, the sanctions can be seen in emptier shops, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=244.32s)]
*  as foreign brands and businesses pause their operations or exit the country entirely. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=247.84s)]
*  There's also bank runs, as those with deposits in foreign currency [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  rush to take it out or convert their rubles to dollars to protect the value of their savings. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=257.2s)]
*  Imagine that you had a bank account full of money and you said, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=262.0s)]
*  well, there's all the money I need to buy my groceries, put gas in my car, and pay my mortgage bill. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=264.64s)]
*  And then one day the government said, I'm sorry, you have all that money, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=269.44s)]
*  but we're not going to let you access it. What's going to happen? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=272.08s)]
*  Well, you're going to starve, your car's going to run out of gas, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=274.56s)]
*  and you're going to default on your mortgage. And that is more or less what's happening to Russia [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=276.64s)]
*  on kind of a macro scale. Russian bond prices also sank. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=280.08s)]
*  The country's dollar-denominated sovereign bonds were quoted at around 17 cents on the dollar on [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=283.76s)]
*  March 2, down from 95 cents the previous week. It is more or less being shoved into the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=288.64s)]
*  financial equivalent of the Stone Age. You'll see over the coming weeks that a global economy, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=295.12s)]
*  a Western-oriented economy, a relatively well-off middle-class economy, is going to see its [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  livelihood be wiped out. Although Russia will bear the brunt of these sanctions, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=305.52s)]
*  their impact is already being felt across the world. You don't cut yourself off from one of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=310.24s)]
*  the world's largest exporters of oil and gas and other valuable commodities overnight and expect [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=314.79999999999995s)]
*  there to be no effect. This month, the price for Brent crude oil hit a record high. Today I'm [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=319.28s)]
*  announcing the United States is targeting the main artery of Russia's economy. The Biden [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=325.44s)]
*  administration banned the import of Russian oil, though the U.S. only imports about 8 percent of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=330.08s)]
*  its oil from Russia. Russia produces 11 percent of global oil and possesses 25 percent of the world's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=334.8s)]
*  natural gas reserves. So cutting those resources off from the global economy is unlikely to happen [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=363.04s)]
*  overnight. That's especially true for Russia's biggest natural gas customer, Europe, which relies [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=367.92s)]
*  on Russia for about 40 percent of its natural gas. And that's the big question mark. Who's going to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=373.12s)]
*  touch gas first? It's a third rail. Will Europe do it and say we're going to take the economic costs [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=378.8s)]
*  no matter what? Putin could preempt that and stop shipments of oil and gas to Europe. That would [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  have a dramatic impact on European economies, but it would also mean that no money is flowing or [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=393.04s)]
*  hardly any money is flowing into Russia anymore. Russia is also the world's largest exporter of [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=400.56s)]
*  wheat, a major exporter of coal, and one of the top producers of metals and fertilizer. How are [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=405.68s)]
*  we going to replace that grain? Right. How are we going to make sure that North Africa and the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=411.52000000000004s)]
*  Middle East don't starve as a result of this? Sanctions are supposed to compel a country to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=415.68s)]
*  change its behavior, but some experts say these economic tools don't always accomplish their [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=420.32s)]
*  goals. I think it could backfire. Yeah. Julia Friedlander says historically they've rarely [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=424.88s)]
*  forced the targeted country to change its behavior. If your goal is to stop a war, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=429.76s)]
*  to stop Putin from flattening Ukraine using financial means, then you may lose. Putin tomorrow [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=434.64s)]
*  could flatten Ukraine through aerial bombardment and then sanctions would have meant nothing. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=440.56s)]
*  We might come to see that these sanctions were not worth it, that all of the effort that we [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  expended actually caused more crisis than we had reckoned with. In some cases, sanctions have [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  hastened global conflict rather than ending it. If you go back in history, you can find the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=458.0s)]
*  sanctions or oil embargo against Japan pushed the Japanese regime into a corner and led them to [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=463.68s)]
*  respond militarily. And we got Pearl Harbor. On March 16th, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=470.96s)]
*  that the central bank would be hiking interest rates to curb rising inflation, which is being [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=477.2s)]
*  exacerbated by the war. The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=481.84s)]
*  from Russia's invasion of Ukraine will put additional upward pressure on near-term inflation [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=486.96s)]
*  here at home. The American government can take steps to help manage and assuage some of the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=492.47999999999996s)]
*  pain that is being felt by those that are affected most directly by the increased energy costs. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=501.52s)]
*  Right now, there is extraordinary support across the West for these sanctions and for the Ukrainian [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  people. It is not clear that six months from now, after a period of very painful, painfully high [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=515.12s)]
*  prices and perhaps weaker economic growth, that that support will still be there. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKEP8sM0R3E&t=520.8s)]
