# Travel Bubbles Lift Hopes of Economic Reboot | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 02, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ)
*  This is what air travel looked like earlier this year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=0.0s)]
*  But when the pandemic hit, flights were grounded. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=4.16s)]
*  Daily trips between New York City and London dropped from 30 flights per day to five. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=7.12s)]
*  And the world's busiest route from Singapore to [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=12.44s)]
*  Kuala Lumpur was cut to just two flights a day. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  A travel ban. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=18.2s)]
*  We will close our border. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Travelers will no longer be permitted to cross the border. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=21.04s)]
*  Before the slew of pandemic-related restrictions, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=24.48s)]
*  travel and tourism accounted for about 10% of global GDP. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=27.599999999999998s)]
*  And now countries are looking for ways to restore some of that air traffic to help speed up economic recovery. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=31.96s)]
*  So destinations are teaming up to create so-called travel bubbles, or what are also known as [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=38.0s)]
*  Corridors or air bridges are all essentially the same thing. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=43.32s)]
*  It's an agreement between two destinations, two countries, for a safe reopening of travel. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=47.32s)]
*  The critical part of a travel bubble? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=54.96s)]
*  No 14-day quarantines on both ends. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=57.2s)]
*  We would only go on a trip if we didn't have to quarantine for 14 days. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=60.24s)]
*  There's been a lot of chatter around loosening travel restrictions, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=64.56s)]
*  but not all of them qualify as travel bubbles. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=67.84s)]
*  For example, New York City and London discussed streamlining restrictions, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  but it wouldn't technically be a travel bubble, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=74.76s)]
*  because both cities would still have required a short quarantine. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=77.08s)]
*  Singapore has been one of the most active in setting up arrangements [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=82.04s)]
*  that allow quarantine-free air travel between destinations. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=85.28s)]
*  I believe it is the first of its kind in the world. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=89.0s)]
*  Singapore has created no quarantine options for travellers, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=93.2s)]
*  and so far, seven countries have signed up. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=96.4s)]
*  Here are the steps to flying quarantine-free and why travel bubbles [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=101.48s)]
*  could be one part of reopening the global economy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=104.56s)]
*  During a pandemic, travel bubbles are meant to find a balance between two extremes, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=110.72s)]
*  letting people come and go freely while risking further spread of the virus. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=115.12s)]
*  And the opposite, where your borders are hermetically closed, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=119.44s)]
*  no one in, no one out, where the economy is suffering enormously. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=122.4s)]
*  Mario Hardy is a travel industry consultant, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=126.56s)]
*  and he says travel bubbles can safely ease countries into gradually reopening their economies. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=129.2s)]
*  When it was first mentioned, people, yay, that's fantastic, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=134.72s)]
*  that's a great solution for us to reopen. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=137.72s)]
*  But after a lot of research, people realised actually it's not that simple. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=140.24s)]
*  Hardy says if both destinations have been successful at containing the virus, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=145.32000000000002s)]
*  laying the groundwork can be easier. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=149.52s)]
*  Assuming you have a good control on both ends, that's one take on the list of criteria. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=151.84s)]
*  Second, you need to have a good healthcare system in both respective destinations. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=158.44s)]
*  So you take the box on that one. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  The first type of bubble Singapore has rolled out with its partners [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=166.44s)]
*  is specifically for government officials and business travellers. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=169.44s)]
*  Before anyone can book a plane ticket, they first need a specific document. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=172.88s)]
*  Probably the most important would be you need to be sponsored by the local company [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=177.16s)]
*  to kind of invite you over to the country. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=181.24s)]
*  Jorjan Lee is a consultant for hotel and resort development projects. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=185.44s)]
*  Before the pandemic, 95% of her job required travelling on business trips. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=189.44s)]
*  After working from home for eight months, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=194.84s)]
*  she took a trip from Singapore to Seoul in early November. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  Lee brought documents to the airport, including her test results [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=201.0s)]
*  and an itinerary that she had to stick to. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=204.04s)]
*  Now you need to also establish a safety protocol between the two destinations. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=207.32s)]
*  Well, you mean testing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=213.39999999999998s)]
*  Lee had to take a total of three tests. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=215.39999999999998s)]
*  So like a pre-departure one within the 72 hours before you leave. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=217.72s)]
*  And then one upon arrival in South Korea and one upon arrival back in Singapore. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=224.4s)]
*  After Lee landed in Seoul, she remained in isolation for less than 24 hours [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=230.56s)]
*  while waiting for her test result. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=235.08s)]
*  After she was confirmed negative, Lee downloaded an app to her phone and headed outside. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=237.0s)]
*  When you go to restaurants or shops, you scan a QR code to register yourself. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=242.04000000000002s)]
*  There would be people actually calling you to check if you have any symptoms. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=248.32s)]
*  In late November, Singapore and Hong Kong were ready to launch a different kind of travel bubble [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=254.44s)]
*  with far fewer requirements. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=259.24s)]
*  Travellers wouldn't need a sponsor letter or a fixed itinerary. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=261.44s)]
*  But they'd still need to take three tests and download the tracking app. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=264.64s)]
*  If it is successful, then some of the protocols might be a bit more relaxed. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  The number of flights will certainly increase. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=272.8s)]
*  There's an immense desire to travel. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=275.52s)]
*  But just two days before the launch, a surge in cases in Hong Kong prompted both cities [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=278.04s)]
*  to delay the travel bubble for two weeks. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=282.56s)]
*  Hardy says countries in Asia have been watching the Singapore-Hong Kong travel bubble [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=285.28s)]
*  as a model for reopening airways safely, only to be reminded that any planning during a pandemic is difficult. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=289.36s)]
*  Meanwhile, other governments are taking tentative steps. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=296.52s)]
*  For instance, a potential travel quarter between the UK and the United Arab Emirates [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=299.6s)]
*  may happen when the lockdown in Britain ends in early December. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=304.36s)]
*  We do encourage destination to follow the model that actually Singapore is doing. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  And a few others within the region have already put these plans together [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=311.52000000000004s)]
*  and have communicated them to the private sectors in the respective countries. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=315.04s)]
*  And that is really helpful for businesses, at least to have a plan. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=318.56s)]
*  Until there's a vaccine, Hardy says travel arrangements that emphasize testing over quarantines [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=322.68s)]
*  can be one of the best ways to help restart economies. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIzkTAYaWPQ&t=328.48s)]
