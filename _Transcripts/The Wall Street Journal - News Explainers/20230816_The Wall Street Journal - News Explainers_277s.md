# Why the Ultra-Rich Want Extreme Travel | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8)
*  Three years ago, luxury travel agent Roman Ciparuga couldn't sell his clients on a big opportunity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=0.0s)]
*  A chance to visit the International Space Station. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=6.16s)]
*  I literally talked to everyone for two years straight telling them about space. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  And initially the response was, no thank you, I'm not interested. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=16.0s)]
*  But two years later, he sold a ticket for $50 million. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=20.56s)]
*  Ignition. Lift off. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  It's a great-looking photograph. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=26.64s)]
*  That trip to the ISS is just one example of a trend that some high-end travel agents are seeing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  Their wealthy clients want a dose of adrenaline with their luxury. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=35.44s)]
*  Here's what's behind the trend and why some experts are concerned about the risks. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=39.84s)]
*  Tourists have been visiting Antarctica since the 1950s. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=46.56s)]
*  But in the last few years, companies have built infrastructure to make these trips [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=50.72s)]
*  more appealing to the ultra-rich, like these so-called sky pods. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=55.04s)]
*  And those experiences that they want to have that prior to the pandemic might not have even been on [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=59.68s)]
*  the radar are now sort of front and center and on the bucket list. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=65.12s)]
*  The concept of YOLO, you only live once, I think has really sort of settled into the mindset of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=70.08s)]
*  post-pandemic travelers. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=76.56s)]
*  Tour operator White Desert has built three camps on the continent. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=78.8s)]
*  The newest can only be reached by private jet. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=82.24s)]
*  Clients can rappel down cliffs, explore ice caves, and hike among fledgling emperor penguins. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=85.44s)]
*  So the bucket list trip has become a trip to do immediately. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=92.0s)]
*  And those folks that have done all of these things are looking for more [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  intrepid and truly unique and enriching experiences. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=100.08s)]
*  For these travelers, the cost can be over $100,000 for seven days. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=103.84s)]
*  Both the polar and Antarctic regions are, I would say that they are booming. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  And it's not just the regions themselves, it's the near Arctic and near Antarctic. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  But the polar regions are under threat from climate change. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  The world's ice is melting faster than ever. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=122.63999999999999s)]
*  We're finding parts of the ice sheet are melting now and possibly going into irreversible melting. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=125.44s)]
*  And in 2022, a paper found that each Antarctic tourist corresponds to about [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=131.68s)]
*  83 tons of snow loss. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=136.56s)]
*  Some travel agents say that despite risks, clients are looking for the next adventure. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=139.92s)]
*  And more travelers are willing to spend to reach these extreme destinations without the hassle. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  The CEO of adventure travel company Untamed Borders said one client wanted to climb K2, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  but didn't have the two weeks it takes to hike to base camp. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=157.92s)]
*  Since private aircraft aren't permitted so close to the disputed border of Pakistan and India, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=161.44s)]
*  Untamed Borders rented high altitude helicopters from the Pakistani army. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=166.56s)]
*  What would have been a 14-day trek took just four hours in the air and cost $40,000. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  As clients take on more risk, some are seeking extra support from companies that specialize [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  in stepping in when things go wrong. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  Dan Richard's crisis response company Global Rescue is expecting more than 100,000 calls in [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=187.76s)]
*  2023 with 2,000 missions and rescues. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=192.96s)]
*  The company saw 221% growth from 2019 to 2022. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  Richard's warns that travelers should take risks seriously. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  I think that some of our traveling members have a very firm grip on what the risks might be. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  But then there are others that get swept up in the excitement of it and don't necessarily [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=212.8s)]
*  consider whether or not they're sort of a good fit for what it might be that they're [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  encountering. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=222.4s)]
*  And on some of the most extreme trips, tourists are beyond rescue. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=223.28s)]
*  If you're 10,000 feet under the ocean or you're five miles up in the atmosphere, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=228.08s)]
*  we're not only not going to be able to get to you, nobody's going to be able to get to you. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=234.72s)]
*  Richard's recommends that travelers do their due diligence. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=237.6s)]
*  It's wonderful that adventure travel is booming. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=240.88s)]
*  A. B. I think people really should do their research and do their homework and try and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  find the experiences that are really good fits for them. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=248.8s)]
*  Despite the dangers to themselves and the planet, many ultra wealthy tourists are undeterred. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=252.96s)]
*  We keep wondering whether or not things are going to start to subside and the boom just continues. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=259.12s)]
*  So we're seeing strong growth basically across the entire sector. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8geBUwRiL8&t=265.2s)]
