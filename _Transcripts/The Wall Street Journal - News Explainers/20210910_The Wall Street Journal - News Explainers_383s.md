# Why Your Uber and Lyft Rides Are So Expensive  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 10, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI)
*  In January 2020, say an Uber ride from New York City's John F. Kennedy Airport to midtown [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=0.0s)]
*  Manhattan cost about $50. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Today, based on the average price rise of Uber rides, that same trip could be $75, about [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=7.48s)]
*  a 50% jump. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=13.32s)]
*  You may have noticed this too. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  According to data from Rakuten Intelligence, the average Uber and Lyft fare in the US rose [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=16.76s)]
*  month to month, from February through July, breaking records each time. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=21.48s)]
*  In July 2021, consumers paid over 50% more per ride compared with January 2020. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=26.46s)]
*  All these customers are complaining that they are actually paying more for their ride. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=32.78s)]
*  The biggest factor that's driving prices up has to do with the pandemic. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=37.14s)]
*  But prices are slowly beginning to rise even before the pandemic. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=40.8s)]
*  To all the viewers seeing this, don't expect dirt cheap prices the way that we had before [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=44.42s)]
*  the pandemic. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=51.900000000000006s)]
*  Here's why your Uber and Lyft rides are going through the roof, and why they might [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=52.900000000000006s)]
*  not ever come all the way back down to where they once were. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=56.1s)]
*  Ride prices are higher for customers right now, especially during the pandemic, because [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=61.04s)]
*  there is that shortage of drivers and increased demand. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=64.86s)]
*  Harry Kemple, an Uber and Lyft driver, runs a popular blog called Rideshare Guy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=67.62s)]
*  Drivers like many others had a huge impact by the pandemic. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=72.18s)]
*  And I think really what we saw at the start was demand for ride hail really just fell [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=75.62s)]
*  off the cliff. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=80.22s)]
*  In early 2020, bookings for Uber rides declined 75% as Americans hunkered down for the pandemic. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=81.34s)]
*  As states have opened back up, the demand for rides has returned faster than the supply [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=88.34s)]
*  of drivers, resulting in price hikes in many cities across the U.S. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=92.06s)]
*  Experts say that prices are taking a while to return to normal for a few reasons. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=96.38s)]
*  I think the number one factor why drivers haven't come back to Uber and Lyft and why [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=100.38s)]
*  we're seeing this shortage on the supply side still to this day is because of unemployment [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=104.98s)]
*  insurance. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=109.7s)]
*  Uber and Lyft are saying that Uber rides are still paying unemployment benefits, but in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=111.18s)]
*  states that have stopped benefits, Uber and Lyft are seeing drivers return and prices [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=114.34s)]
*  go down. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=118.5s)]
*  Uber has said that they've seen prices come down in places like Miami, Houston and Atlanta, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=119.5s)]
*  whereas big cities like New York, San Francisco and L.A., prices are still high there because [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=127.54s)]
*  drivers haven't returned. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=134.02s)]
*  Uber said 90% of the 90,000 inactive drivers they surveyed in June indicated they plan [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=135.02s)]
*  to return when unemployment benefits expire in most states. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=140.66s)]
*  Another factor keeping prices up? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=143.85999999999999s)]
*  Rideshare companies aren't just competing for drivers amongst themselves. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=145.9s)]
*  They're also competing with food delivery services, which drivers say offer safer work [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=148.66s)]
*  conditions. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=153.7s)]
*  Actually, traditionally, driving for hire has always been a pretty dangerous job. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=154.7s)]
*  You really don't know who's getting into your car at all times. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=158.94s)]
*  I mean, I think the CDC recommendation was to stay six feet away from people and as soon [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=161.82s)]
*  as someone gets into your car, they're breaking that rule. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=166.46s)]
*  So a lot of gig workers have switched over to delivery services and found that they liked it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=168.74s)]
*  Riders, on the other hand, are back on the road in droves. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  As rider demand has increased, both Uber and Lyft increased driver bonuses earlier this [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=177.02s)]
*  year to attract more drivers back to the platform. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=181.78s)]
*  In April, Uber announced it was allocating $250 million in an effort to boost driver [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=184.94s)]
*  availability. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=190.3s)]
*  Lyft spent $572 million on driver incentives through the second quarter of 2021. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=191.3s)]
*  For now, these incentives seem to be working. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=197.66s)]
*  According to Lyft, more drivers are coming back to the platform in recent months. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=199.82s)]
*  As drivers return to their roads, Uber and Lyft hope that prices will stabilize. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=203.98s)]
*  But they'll probably never be as cheap as they typically were in the last decade. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=208.54s)]
*  There are a few reasons for this. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=212.9s)]
*  For one, Uber and Lyft have begun phasing out discounts to riders even before the pandemic. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=214.74s)]
*  What started happening before the pandemic is that pressure started to build from investors. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=219.74s)]
*  People started saying you have to have a sustainable model to future profits. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=225.46s)]
*  Uber and Lyft have been using a subsidy model since the very beginning, and that model is [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=230.66s)]
*  fairly simple. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=234.98000000000002s)]
*  Startups raise venture capital and use those funds to attract customers with deep discounts. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=236.70000000000002s)]
*  These subsidies could come in many forms, from low shipping rates for e-commerce sites [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  to coupons for free food delivery. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=246.10000000000002s)]
*  For ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft, subsidies have involved attracting riders [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=248.24s)]
*  with big discounts, and then incentivizing drivers to provide those rides. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=252.38s)]
*  But in recent years, the companies have begun phasing out those rider discounts. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=256.46s)]
*  They are not profitable companies. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  They lose money nearly every year. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=262.54s)]
*  We don't know when they will turn a net profit. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=264.98s)]
*  For now, rideshare companies are still offering drivers incentives as a way of making driving [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=268.4s)]
*  more attractive for the long haul, given the ongoing challenges. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=272.62s)]
*  However, Uber said that their driver numbers have increased to a point where they'll be [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  pulling back on driver incentives moving forward. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=280.14s)]
*  The company's near-term challenge is keeping drivers after that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=282.97999999999996s)]
*  The bonus pay every single week might be 30% of a driver's pay. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=286.5s)]
*  So you could imagine that if they completely got rid of these bonuses one day and drivers [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=290.3s)]
*  saw their pay cut by 30%, you'd have a huge exodus of drivers at a time where the companies [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=293.97999999999996s)]
*  are already struggling to match supply and match demand. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=299.38s)]
*  So companies are thinking of new ways to make driving more attractive. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=302.82s)]
*  One of the things that Uber began doing is that it started offering free online language [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=306.28s)]
*  classes for drivers. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=313.08s)]
*  The company says, you know, a lot of their drivers are immigrants. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=314.08s)]
*  English is not their first language. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=318.4s)]
*  So this could be a tool that they could use to move up the ladder and develop new skills. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=320.76s)]
*  Also adding to the cost of rides, when regulatory changes like Prop 22 went into effect in late [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=326.53999999999996s)]
*  Companies shifted some of the financial burden to customers. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=332.52s)]
*  If consumers want better benefits for drivers, then we should also be willing to pay slightly [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=337.0s)]
*  more. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=344.12s)]
*  Both Uber and Lyft are focusing more on long-term profits. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=345.12s)]
*  Analysts say consumers should expect to pay more per ride compared to the discounted rates [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=348.68s)]
*  before the pandemic. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=352.52s)]
*  I think that they probably weren't paying, you know, the full cost of the fare in a lot [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=353.52s)]
*  of these situations and kind of getting a good deal. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=357.76s)]
*  Drivers may have to pay a little bit more for their rides and they may not like it, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=360.6s)]
*  but hopefully they'll find solace in the fact that, you know, drivers, you know, are [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=364.64000000000004s)]
*  getting, you know, part of that ride. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=369.20000000000005s)]
*  For consumers, rideshare prices probably will not stay at their current heights. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=371.66s)]
*  However, you probably won't see those low subsidized prices again anytime soon. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uSmKTa0iI&t=375.68s)]
