# Trump’s vs. Biden’s Plans to Prevent Another ‘China Shock’  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM)
*  I want competition with China, not conflict. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=0.0s)]
*  I would impose tariffs to confront China's massive theft of America's jobs. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=3.36s)]
*  The rhetoric that you hear from Donald Trump and Joe Biden on trade with China, it's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=9.48s)]
*  similar in a lot of important ways. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=13.8s)]
*  They share the same overall philosophy, which is that the U.S. has done too much of it in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=15.68s)]
*  the past. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  President Biden and Donald Trump are both issuing blueprints to compete against China, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  disrupting the free trade status quo Washington has held for decades. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=27.8s)]
*  President Trump has gone all in. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=32.28s)]
*  President Biden has been more targeted. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  Here's a look at the 2024 election foes' different trade strategies and how they could [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=36.52s)]
*  affect U.S. consumers. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=40.84s)]
*  To understand the trade relations between China and the U.S., let's first rewind to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=44.8s)]
*  2001, the year China joined the World Trade Organization. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=49.64s)]
*  Once China had joined the WTO, a lot of uncertainty about what would happen in the relationship [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=53.44s)]
*  disappeared. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=58.96s)]
*  This step represents great progress for China, the WTO, and the world trading system. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=59.96s)]
*  Between 2001 and the great financial crisis, the Chinese economy underwent enormous growth [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=66.28s)]
*  and productivity growth and a huge export surge. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=72.96s)]
*  A lot of foreign investment went into China and a lot of the export surge was driven by [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=76.16s)]
*  so-called foreign invested enterprises who use China as a processing platform for exports. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=81.76s)]
*  U.S. imports from China grew more than fivefold over two decades, reaching a high of more [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  than $560 billion in 2022. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=93.72s)]
*  At the same time, we saw beginning of what turned out to be a pretty rapid decline in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=97.44s)]
*  manufacturing employment in the U.S. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=102.36000000000001s)]
*  And this decline in employment has been linked to opening of trade with China. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=105.48s)]
*  That's the so-called China shock narrative. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=110.52s)]
*  While economists are divided over the magnitude of the China shock, many agree that... [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=113.44s)]
*  There was this massive flood of cheap Chinese goods that came into the United States and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=117.96s)]
*  factories and workers in the United States that were building those same things suddenly [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=122.84s)]
*  couldn't compete. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=127.52s)]
*  That was a kind of political undercurrent that really jumped into center stage when [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=128.78s)]
*  Donald Trump ran for presidency the first time in 2016. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=133.16s)]
*  Because we can't continue to allow China to rape our country and that's what they're doing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=137.16s)]
*  During the Trump administration in 2018, the U.S. levied tariffs on roughly $360 billion [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=143.48s)]
*  worth of Chinese imports from electronics to toys to apparel. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=149.6s)]
*  His approach to China was completely different than what came before. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  About two-thirds of our imports from China were now subject to these large taxes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=157.76s)]
*  So that fundamentally changed how we viewed trade with China. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=162.8s)]
*  Biden, despite divisions within his own administration, has kept Trump's tariffs in place, even amid [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=167.12s)]
*  high inflation. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  One of the key initiatives under the Biden administration has been trying to build up [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=174.4s)]
*  a clean energy industry in the United States. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=179.32000000000002s)]
*  And at the same time, China has been really massively expanding their production of some [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=181.8s)]
*  of these same clean energy goods. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  There's been, within the Biden administration, increasing concern about how China is directing [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=188.84s)]
*  its economy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=193.98s)]
*  That concern was clear in May when Biden elevated the Trump-era tariffs on an array of imports. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=195.6s)]
*  Among the increases were Chinese electric vehicles, which went from 25% to 100%. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  Steel and aluminum products increased from 7.5% to 25%. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=207.84s)]
*  Solar cells rose from 25% to 50%. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  The White House said the new tariffs would apply to roughly $18 billion worth of products [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=216.0s)]
*  from China. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=221.02s)]
*  China heavily subsidized all these products, pushing Chinese companies to produce far more [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=222.02s)]
*  than the rest of the world can absorb, and then dumping the excess products onto the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=226.92s)]
*  market at unfairly low prices. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=231.48s)]
*  In a sense, or very real way, these tariffs are a counterpart to the industrial policy [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=233.88s)]
*  that we've been doing at home. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=239.7s)]
*  We can't be producing autos, solar, and even semiconductors, and then still importing [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=241.58s)]
*  very low-cost items that undercut the production that's being done in the United States. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=248.08s)]
*  Most of us saw it coming. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=253.62s)]
*  It's like the other hand of the industrial policy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=256.14s)]
*  A tariff is a tax, typically intended to limit the amount of an imported good and protect [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=259.58000000000004s)]
*  domestic jobs. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=264.98s)]
*  Who ultimately pays for it is a long-running debate. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=266.26s)]
*  But economic evidence suggests that the current tariffs, rather than forcing Chinese sellers [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=269.1s)]
*  to charge less, were largely passed on to American buyers. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=273.86s)]
*  The White House argues Biden's trade plan is more targeted than Trump's, who has made [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=278.66s)]
*  it clear that he's willing to slap on even higher tariffs if he becomes the next president. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=283.06s)]
*  I will put a 200% tax on every car that comes in from those plans. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=288.42s)]
*  Among his proposals, Trump has suggested imposing a 10% levy on global imports. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=294.1s)]
*  And that tariff goes to at least 60% on all imports from China, roughly $430 billion worth [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=299.5s)]
*  of goods. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=306.18s)]
*  Americans are bearing the burden of these tariffs. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=307.18s)]
*  Low-income people are burdened most heavily. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=309.92s)]
*  Middle-income second heavily. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=312.94s)]
*  And the richest people the least heavily. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=315.04s)]
*  Now why is that? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=318.18s)]
*  You might think, well, rich person spends a lot of money, so they must be paying a lot [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=319.18s)]
*  of these taxes. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=323.64s)]
*  Well, that's true. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=324.64s)]
*  But it's a very small share of their income. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=325.96s)]
*  Trump defended his proposals in a March interview with CNBC, saying that tax cuts could help [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=329.12s)]
*  offset his planned tariff increases. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=334.21999999999997s)]
*  China is right now our boss. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=337.28s)]
*  They are the boss of the United States, almost like we're a subsidiary of China. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=339.53999999999996s)]
*  In recent months, Beijing has turned to Europe for a more accommodating stance on trade. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  The U.S. continues to politicize trade issues, and further increases tariffs on China. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=349.76s)]
*  It's a mistake after a mistake. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=354.8s)]
*  Between the United States and China, a kind of key constituency, an almost swing vote [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=356.62s)]
*  between the two of them, is the European Union. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=361.36s)]
*  Europe for what it's worth does share broadly some of the American concerns about Chinese [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=364.28s)]
*  economic practices. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=368.8s)]
*  But there is still overall in Europe a hesitance to go down the exact same road that the United [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=369.9s)]
*  States is going down when it comes to China. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  Whether Biden would institute additional tariffs against China during a second term is unclear. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=377.92s)]
*  A spokesperson for Biden's re-election campaign told the Journal that Biden is taking a targeted [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=383.04s)]
*  approach to protect American workers and industry. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=388.12s)]
*  A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to the Journal's request for comment. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=391.76s)]
*  Well, tariffs definitely increase prices. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=395.68s)]
*  So that's a negative that both candidates would probably want to avoid, but they can't. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=398.36s)]
*  So they have to decide how much they want to use tariffs as an instrument. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  No matter who wins this election, whether it's Trump or Biden, we will be living in [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=406.36s)]
*  the United States where the most powerful people in the country think about these fundamental [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=410.56s)]
*  issues in a very different way than they did even 10 years ago. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=415.36s)]
*  I think that that kind of guiding goal of building more things in the United States, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=419.56s)]
*  making more things in the United States, and not relying on China will be here to stay. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy5xLrF0APM&t=424.68s)]
