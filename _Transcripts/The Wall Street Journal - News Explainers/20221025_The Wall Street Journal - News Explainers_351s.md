# It’s the IPO Market’s Worst Year in Two Decades. What Happened? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ)
*  In 2021, the IPO pipeline was flowing with record volume. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=0.0s)]
*  An IPO, or Initial Public Offering, is the traditional way a company goes public by listing shares on a stock exchange. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=4.48s)]
*  And last year, IPOs raised more money than ever. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=10.64s)]
*  One of the biggest IPOs since Alibaba. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=13.44s)]
*  The biggest IPO of 2021. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=15.64s)]
*  But by December, a broad sell-off in high-growth stocks led to two-thirds of those in the US trading below their IPO price. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=18.16s)]
*  And now, the IPO pipeline is seemingly frozen. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=24.76s)]
*  We haven't seen the slow a year in terms of money raised since at least 2009. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=29.52s)]
*  That's because sky-high inflation, rising interest rates, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=36.64s)]
*  have made the financial markets volatile and in turn made investors wary of risky assets like IPOs. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=41.2s)]
*  Everything that you could think of that would make launching an IPO unpalatable, it was happening. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=46.96s)]
*  And now, analysts are worried that if it doesn't turn around soon, the IPO freeze could carry over into the new year. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=54.44s)]
*  So far this year, traditional IPOs have raised only around $7 billion. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=61.4s)]
*  In a typical year, traditional IPOs would have raised around $38 billion by this time. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=65.92s)]
*  And at this time last year, the number was closer to $120 billion. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=70.6s)]
*  Several major companies, including two fintech giants, had anticipated going public in 2022 [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=74.68s)]
*  before the pipeline froze and their valuation shriveled up with it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=80.12s)]
*  It was supposed to be the year of the fintech company. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=83.6s)]
*  There were many in the pipeline ready to go. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=86.64s)]
*  We have not seen them. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=90.28s)]
*  Klarna Bank AB was one of those highly anticipated IPOs. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=92.28s)]
*  But instead of making a splashy debut, the Sweden-based company laid off hundreds of workers to cut costs [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  and was forced to seek funding in private markets. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=100.52s)]
*  Its more than $45 billion valuation dropped by 85%, down to $6.7 billion. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=103.0s)]
*  Klarna declined to comment on its IPO plans. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=108.96s)]
*  Instacart also had to slash its valuation, in this case by around 70% to $13 billion. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=111.56s)]
*  However, with its growing revenue, Instacart was among a few companies still hoping for some heat [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=117.6s)]
*  and the opportunity to go public this year. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  There's a renewed focus on show that you can become profitable, if not right now, very soon. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=124.84s)]
*  But the company reeled back its ambitions in late October. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  In a memo to employees, Instacart's CEO said that tumultuous market conditions are making an IPO for the company [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=137.44s)]
*  highly unlikely in 2022. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=143.52s)]
*  But one area that has broken through the ice this year is spinoffs. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=145.68s)]
*  This is when a larger company separates one of its subsidiaries or branches into a separate public company. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=149.32s)]
*  Intel's self-driving car unit, Mobileye, is one of those IPOs expected to come through. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=154.84s)]
*  After purchasing the unit for around $15 billion, Intel was expecting a Mobileye valuation near $50 billion last year. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=159.6s)]
*  But today, Intel is expecting a target valuation under $20 billion. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=167.4s)]
*  Intel's CEO has said that listing Mobileye would give the self-driving car unit a higher profile and attract more business. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  He has also said that Intel doesn't need the money Mobileye's IPO would generate. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=178.88000000000002s)]
*  But Mobileye wouldn't be the first IPO in the auto industry to go public in this weather. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=182.96s)]
*  Porsche launched on the Frankfurt Exchange at the end of September. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=187.4s)]
*  Though it's not a US IPO, many analysts agreed that if Porsche's went well, it would be a positive sign for the US IPO market. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=190.56s)]
*  However, Porsche's IPO, I wouldn't call a raging success. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  Yes, it priced at the high end of its range, but shares didn't do very well, didn't have a great pop. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=202.4s)]
*  That pop she's talking about is how bankers evaluate their initial pricing strategy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=209.88s)]
*  They look for a pop to show momentum, but not too big of one that would signal money was left on the table. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=214.32s)]
*  Porsche declined to comment on its IPO. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=219.64s)]
*  The joke is how you price an IPO. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=221.92s)]
*  It's an art, not a science, as they say. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=224.32s)]
*  You want to see shares go up. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=226.6s)]
*  Maybe not. You definitely don't want to see them double the first day, but you want to see them rise. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=228.48s)]
*  Now, investors will look for green shoots, signals that the market is warming up. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=234.28s)]
*  However, the indicators of today may look different than recent years. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=238.4s)]
*  In 2020, 2021, you could go to market with a dream and a vision of how you were going to make money and how you were going to grow so fast. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=242.12s)]
*  That isn't going to cut it in 2022 and 2023, or at least doesn't look like it will cut it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=253.28s)]
*  The electric vehicle truck company Rivian is viewed as one of the last big IPOs before the market crashed. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=259.6s)]
*  It scored evaluations so high that meant it was more valuable than Ford. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  You're starting to see cracks in the U.S. economy. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=268.64s)]
*  Remember, just a couple of weeks after Rivian, that's when the stock market started really shifting and selling down a lot. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  Rivian stock price has since come down. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=278.72s)]
*  The company was hit with a lawsuit for allegedly misleading investors about electric vehicle prices. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=280.76000000000005s)]
*  And recently, it recalled around 13,000 vehicles for loose fasteners. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=285.76000000000005s)]
*  Rivian did not respond to a request for comment. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  Historically, IPOs are viewed as one of the riskiest asset classes. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=292.88000000000005s)]
*  Because you're investing in a brand new company, few have a history of profits. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=296.6s)]
*  However, a flowing IPO pipeline means companies are raising more money, which can lead to more hiring, investing in tech and employees finally getting to cash in on their stock options. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=300.44000000000005s)]
*  So what would it take to thaw the IPO pipeline? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=310.64s)]
*  Success begets success. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=313.47999999999996s)]
*  So you just need to see a string of IPOs do well to encourage more companies to want to go public. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=315.52s)]
*  But even as some look to push the pipeline forward, the broader financial market remains volatile. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=323.0s)]
*  IPO bankers and lawyers agree they say the first companies to go public after the markets calm down should be profitable, fairly large and must own names. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  It all comes down to appetite for risk. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=336.28s)]
*  When investors are comfortable stomaching that risk, the IPO market is strong and the economy usually looks stable as well. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btW1mHAvtGQ&t=338.24s)]
