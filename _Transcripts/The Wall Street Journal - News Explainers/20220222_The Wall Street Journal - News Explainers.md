# Why Peloton Spun Out What Happened to the Bike and Treadmill Company  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI)
*  Let's go! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=0.0s)]
*  Over the last two years, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=2.72s)]
*  fitness sensation Peloton has been on a wild ride. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=4.24s)]
*  Even before the pandemic, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=8.48s)]
*  the subscriber-based company had amassed a cult following. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=9.92s)]
*  And at the height of the pandemic, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=13.6s)]
*  shares reached all-time highs. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  No one is getting left behind. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=17.2s)]
*  Peloton is for anyone who wants it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=18.72s)]
*  But then, almost suddenly, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=20.72s)]
*  the world and Peloton's luck shifted. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=22.56s)]
*  Gyms and offices began reopening [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=25.36s)]
*  as lockdown restrictions were lifted. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=27.28s)]
*  And over a single year, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=29.04s)]
*  the company lost nearly all of its pandemic stock market gains. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=30.56s)]
*  Here's how Peloton, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=34.48s)]
*  the once high-flying fitness craze, spun out, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=36.0s)]
*  losing billions of dollars in market share in the process. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=38.96s)]
*  Peloton launched a decade ago as a stationary bike company [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  that had big aspirations for democratizing the fitness world. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Peloton had this vision pre-pandemic even, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  that everyone who had broadband internet [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=52.96s)]
*  would want a Peloton and could afford a Peloton. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  Laura Forman covers technology for the Hurt on the Street column [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=57.52s)]
*  at The Wall Street Journal. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  She says that the company's subscribers [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=62.32s)]
*  were primarily wealthy consumers, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=64.4s)]
*  with the means to invest in high-end exercise equipment [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  with a monthly subscription fee. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=69.28s)]
*  This is a company that wanted to be accessible [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=71.12s)]
*  but gained a cult following because it was the opposite of that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=73.04s)]
*  It was aspirational. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  And it really became this whole lifestyle. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=77.76s)]
*  That's one reason. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=79.84s)]
*  And then the second reason is just people were obsessed with the content. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=80.64s)]
*  But the company knew that to continue to grow, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=83.68s)]
*  it needed to expand its user base. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=86.16s)]
*  And in early 2020, as the world shut down, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=88.24s)]
*  demand for home exercise equipment surged. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=93.44s)]
*  People weren't traveling. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=96.16s)]
*  They weren't going outside. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=97.44s)]
*  So maybe they had some of that budget [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=98.88s)]
*  that they could sort of allocate to fitness. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=100.88s)]
*  Peloton, come on, let's get this workout started. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=103.6s)]
*  And with the surge in demand, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=105.92s)]
*  the fitness company became a big success. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=107.52s)]
*  Its market value grew considerably, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=110.08s)]
*  reaching almost $50 billion in early 2021, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=112.4s)]
*  up from just $7 billion two years prior. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=115.84s)]
*  Over a single year, the company gained almost a million new subscribers. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  But even in the midst of its success during the pandemic, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=123.2s)]
*  Peloton was already facing issues. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=125.92s)]
*  By late 2020, as demand for its products soared, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=128.4s)]
*  the company was racing to fill orders. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=131.6s)]
*  But it was struggling to keep up. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=133.84s)]
*  Complaints from customers about delays and missed deliveries mounted, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=136.0s)]
*  and Peloton's share price began to plunge. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=139.68s)]
*  They invested a ton in sustaining this monster growth [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=142.4s)]
*  that was never going to be sustainable. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=146.8s)]
*  And then, in March 2021, a fatal incident occurred involving Peloton's high-end treadmill. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  Tragic Peloton accident that resulted in the death of a child. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=154.88s)]
*  The company has issued new warnings to owners in the wake of the accident. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=157.76s)]
*  The incident pushed Peloton to recall its treadmills. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  And this move was costly. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=164.08s)]
*  Peloton estimated that recalling and halting sales of its treadmills [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  would cost the company around $165 million over a single quarter in 2021. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=170.4s)]
*  It really threw cold water on the notion that Peloton could continue to grow. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=176.32s)]
*  Maybe they were growing too quickly, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  or they weren't really putting as much thought into every product. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=182.24s)]
*  Trouble for the company continued into the summer of 2021. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=186.0s)]
*  As vaccines became more widely available and gyms began reopening, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=189.36s)]
*  the company faced mounting challenges. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=193.44s)]
*  When the world opened up and all the people who could afford a Peloton already had one, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=195.76s)]
*  you saw demand start to decline. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=200.08s)]
*  In the attempt to appeal to a broader audience, Peloton slashed prices. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=202.4s)]
*  But as demand continued to fall, the move ended up hurting the company's bottom line. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=206.96s)]
*  By the end of the year, Peloton's stock had plummeted, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=212.0s)]
*  losing more than three-quarters of its value from its December 2020 high, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  which erased most of its pandemic-era gains. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  The company's market value had dropped about 85%. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=221.68s)]
*  Then, in early 2022, the company changed its price decision [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=225.44s)]
*  and added hundreds of dollars in fees to its bike and treadmill, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=229.36s)]
*  a move that came as the company grappled with waning demand. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  And for some investors, the situation looked dire. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=236.96s)]
*  Around the same time, news broke that Peloton was temporarily [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=240.4s)]
*  halting production of its connected fitness products amid a company-wide hiring freeze. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=244.08s)]
*  Peloton, the shares reopened after being halted twice. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=248.8s)]
*  They're now down more than 20%. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=252.0s)]
*  Just weeks later, under pressure from an activist investor, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=254.0s)]
*  the company announced it would be replacing its CEO and cutting 2,800 jobs, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=257.28s)]
*  about 20% of its workforce, in an effort to get back on track. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=262.08s)]
*  The changes announced are exactly the types of things that investors and analysts want to be [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=266.0s)]
*  seeing. It's, you know, a new manager, a new cost structure. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=270.32s)]
*  Forman says it's no coincidence that the new CEO, Barry McCarthy, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  was the CFO of Netflix and Spotify, both lower-price subscription-based companies. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=280.55999999999995s)]
*  Some think Barry's going to come in and completely change the company from a company [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=286.08s)]
*  that was aspirational to a company that truly is accessible with really lower-price subscription [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=290.88s)]
*  models. Others think there's really no hope for the company and it just needs to get sold. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=296.8s)]
*  But one thing is for certain, the road ahead for Peloton is a steep climb. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R6rgrWJCRI&t=301.12s)]
