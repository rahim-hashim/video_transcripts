# Harris Leads Trump Narrowly in 2024 Presidential Race, WSJ Poll Finds  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q)
*  A new Wall Street Journal poll shows that Vice President Kamala Harris has taken a narrow [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=0.0s)]
*  lead over former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=5.68s)]
*  Harris had 48% support to Trump's 47% in a head-to-head test, claiming an advantage [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=8.2s)]
*  within the survey's margin of error. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=14.36s)]
*  This poll has heightened importance in some ways because it's coming right after the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=16.44s)]
*  Democratic National Convention. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=21.84s)]
*  And that convention and the weeks leading up to it were so crucial for Kamala Harris [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=24.26s)]
*  as she tried to essentially reintroduce herself to the American public. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=29.24s)]
*  Okay, let's get to business. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=34.199999999999996s)]
*  Let's get to business. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  Here are the major takeaways from the poll. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  According to the poll, more than 80% of people say they feel like they know enough about [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=42.839999999999996s)]
*  Harris to have an opinion about her. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=47.36s)]
*  There could be some downside there if she's still trying to tell people things about herself, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=49.44s)]
*  but it's clear that she has established herself with voters in a way, and at least some of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=53.32s)]
*  the story she's trying to tell appears to be breaking through. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=58.32s)]
*  You really saw this in full display at the Democratic National Convention, an effort [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=62.0s)]
*  to tell a story of Harris both as a politician but also as a person. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=66.2s)]
*  The middle class is where I come from. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=71.56s)]
*  My mother kept a strict budget. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=75.12s)]
*  We lived within our means, yet we wanted for little. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=77.88s)]
*  And the story she's trying to tell is that she is somebody who is thinking about the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=82.82s)]
*  middle class. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=87.08s)]
*  She is concerned about prices and the price of housing. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=88.32s)]
*  She has plans to try and work on these issues. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  She's trying very hard to connect with voters and say that she understands and is going [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=95.52s)]
*  to fight for them. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=100.53999999999999s)]
*  But Trump still holds advantages over Harris on key issues like the economy and immigration. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=104.88s)]
*  And that I think is probably part of the reason you're seeing his advisors really want him [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=110.56s)]
*  to focus on policy, want him to focus on issues like that, because that is where he is the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=113.44s)]
*  strongest. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=117.64s)]
*  On day one, I will seal the border and I will stop the invasion of millions of people into [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=118.64s)]
*  our country. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=124.48s)]
*  Harris, on the other hand, has expanded her lead as the candidate best suited to handle [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=125.48s)]
*  abortion rights. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=130.2s)]
*  And that's significant because we have had a series of elections now where we've really [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=131.2s)]
*  seen huge numbers of people turn out to vote on abortion, and it's going to be on the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=135.56s)]
*  ballot in some of these key states. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=140.84s)]
*  So that could be very meaningful for her. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=142.8s)]
*  Despite falling behind in some policy points, Harris's favorability overall is higher than [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  Trump's, according to the poll. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  Harris's improving numbers in a lot of these categories suggests that Trump has really [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  struggled to land an effective critique of her, that his efforts to label her extreme [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=159.12s)]
*  or out of step with a lot of the public haven't really worked yet. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=166.08s)]
*  Trumps also have a largely unfavorable view of Project 2025, a conservative policy agenda [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=170.64s)]
*  assembled by the Heritage Foundation think tank and its allies. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump has worked pretty hard to try and distance himself from Project 2025. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  He has said that this is not a blueprint for another administration. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=184.0s)]
*  But certainly Democrats for now seem to have been pretty successful in giving the public [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=188.67999999999998s)]
*  a negative view of these policies. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=193.56s)]
*  Their Project 2025 will make things much, much harder for people who are just trying [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=195.92s)]
*  to live their lives. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  As we're looking ahead, we're going to see both of them out in the battleground states [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=202.72s)]
*  a lot. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  That's happening already. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  There's going to be a lot more campaigning. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  And the next really big opportunity for both of them is the upcoming debate on September [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=209.72s)]
*  10th in Philadelphia. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=214.92s)]
*  Both sides see that as a big opportunity to remind voters about the candidates and to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=216.73999999999998s)]
*  really see them against each other for the first time. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPR0w1WUo4Q&t=222.11999999999998s)]
