# Home DNA Tests Can Disrupt Family Dynamics. Here's How | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 27, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o)
*  You might have seen one of these before, an at-home DNA test. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=0.0s)]
*  The boxes might look small, but they're making a big impact on some people's lives. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=5.4s)]
*  Kits like these have exploded in popularity over the past five years. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=10.64s)]
*  Most people take them because they want to know more about their background, like what [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=16.66s)]
*  countries their ancestors were from or if they're really related to George Washington. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=20.0s)]
*  And for many, the results are what they expect. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=25.48s)]
*  But for others, the results can radically change their lives. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=28.72s)]
*  A lot of people take these tests hoping for something entertaining. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=32.76s)]
*  Maybe they heard they're Italian or German and they think it would be fun to find out [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=36.28s)]
*  more. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=39.76s)]
*  But often when they get the results back, they're surprised by what they find. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=41.12s)]
*  So how can that happen? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  Meet Sally. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=47.64s)]
*  We made her up to show how this can work. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=48.72s)]
*  Sally took DNA tests with her family, her mom, her dad, her brother, and her sister. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=51.16s)]
*  Six weeks later, they went online to check their results. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=57.48s)]
*  The company provided a long list of genetic matches, ranked in order by the amount of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=60.8s)]
*  DNA shared, and measured in a unit called centimorgans. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=65.0s)]
*  Often DNA testing companies will return a list of your genetic matches to you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=68.72s)]
*  They usually rank your genetic matches from the highest number of centimorgans you share [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  with someone down to the fewest number of centimorgans. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=76.5s)]
*  So you're going to expect to share the most centimorgans with the people who are closest [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  to you. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=84.44s)]
*  Parents and children share around half of their DNA. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=85.44s)]
*  Siblings share a little bit less. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=88.16s)]
*  Half siblings share around a quarter. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=89.84s)]
*  You get the idea. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=91.5s)]
*  So naturally, Sally saw both of her parents at the top of the list. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=93.28s)]
*  They each shared around 3,400 centimorgan in common with her. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=96.86s)]
*  Next she saw her brother, who shared 2,700 centimorgan. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=101.28s)]
*  And then her sister, who she shared around 1,700 centimorgan. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=105.36s)]
*  This was the first red flag for Sally. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=109.72s)]
*  Why do these numbers look so different? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=112.12s)]
*  It turns out 1,700 centimorgan isn't enough for Sally's sister to be her full sister. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=115.28s)]
*  But it is enough for them to be half siblings. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=121.88s)]
*  They talked to their mother. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=125.08s)]
*  And it turns out she had an affair. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=126.08s)]
*  In our hypothetical example, Sally found out that her mother had an affair. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=129.18s)]
*  But that's not the only thing that people find out. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=133.56s)]
*  Many people have been able to identify their biological relatives when they were adopted. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=136.2s)]
*  Other people have discovered that they were conceived using sperm donations. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=140.74s)]
*  That wasn't the only surprise in store for Sally and her family. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=144.66s)]
*  Sally's father Andy checked out his DNA results too. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=148.26s)]
*  He already knew about the affair, so he wasn't surprised that one of his daughters wasn't a match. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=151.62s)]
*  But he did notice several names high up on the list that he didn't recognize. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=156.58s)]
*  When Andy was a college student, he made sperm donations in order to earn extra money. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=160.94s)]
*  And he assumed that his sperm donations would always remain anonymous. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=165.54000000000002s)]
*  But now, many people who were donor-conceived can find their sperm donors via DNA testing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=169.4s)]
*  This person shared 3,400 centimorgans with Andy, and as it turned out, was his biological son. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=175.5s)]
*  So Sally's been through a lot. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=182.98000000000002s)]
*  She's learned that her sister is her half-sister, and now she has another half-sibling on her dad's side. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=184.5s)]
*  Sally was reeling from the twist and turns in their family DNA when... [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=190.5s)]
*  The phone rings at Sally's home. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=194.66000000000003s)]
*  It's the police. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=196.86s)]
*  They found Sally's DNA in a database. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=198.22000000000003s)]
*  Many people take more than one test. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=201.74s)]
*  They want to expand the number of relatives they can potentially match with. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=204.62s)]
*  Another way to do this is to take the results and put them on a website that has a public database. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=208.5s)]
*  Many consumers, if not most, are taking these tests for purposes of genealogy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=214.06s)]
*  They're not expecting that law enforcement might be interested in using the results to track down possible criminals. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=218.58s)]
*  But increasingly, law enforcement officials use the databases as well, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=224.9s)]
*  working with genealogists to try and solve crimes, mainly cold cases and missing persons. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=228.54s)]
*  Here's how that works. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=234.14s)]
*  Police take DNA from a crime scene that usually comes from the victim or suspected criminal. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=236.1s)]
*  Then, police upload the DNA into one of the big DNA databases and look for genetic matches between the crime scene DNA and others who have tested. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=241.5s)]
*  When there is a genetic match, genealogists are able to use the information in the databases to build a rough family tree. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=249.94s)]
*  They're then able to use publicly available information, such as obituaries or wedding announcements, which are often available online to get more names. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=257.26s)]
*  They might look at Facebook and other social media postings, again, to find more connections between people. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=266.94s)]
*  Once investigators and genealogists have created a family tree, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=273.42s)]
*  the investigators can narrow down the leads and figure out from the family tree who was born at the most likely time that the suspect was born, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=277.46s)]
*  who was living in the most likely place where the crime was committed or someone disappeared. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=285.1s)]
*  For Sally's family, the call from the police helped solve a mystery. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=291.58000000000004s)]
*  Law enforcement used clues from their family tree to find a missing person. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=295.14000000000004s)]
*  To be clear, Sally's experience with DNA is not the typical one. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=300.02000000000004s)]
*  It's not every day that someone discovers a family affair, a distant half-brother and helps solve a crime. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=304.26000000000005s)]
*  But all of these things do happen, and they're happening more often as DNA tests gain popularity. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=310.38s)]
*  The growing popularity of DNA testing and the increasing sizes of the databases have really raised privacy concerns. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=316.61999999999995s)]
*  Decades ago, people were promised anonymity when they gave up their children for adoption or when they participated in sperm donation. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=324.02s)]
*  And now, suddenly, thanks to DNA testing, people are able to track down the identities of these people. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=331.65999999999997s)]
*  There are a number of people who say that they don't want to do DNA testing because they want to preserve their genetic privacy. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=337.38s)]
*  But the fact is that even if you choose not to do a DNA test, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=343.34s)]
*  a distant cousin that you don't know and may have never met is possibly making another decision. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=347.17999999999995s)]
*  And that decision is going to affect your privacy as well. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=352.85999999999996s)]
*  Some of your DNA may be used by people to unravel family secrets or track down potential criminals or all the other uses that it's currently being used for. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=356.02s)]
*  Even some uses that we haven't anticipated yet. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAB-YTp59o&t=364.98s)]
