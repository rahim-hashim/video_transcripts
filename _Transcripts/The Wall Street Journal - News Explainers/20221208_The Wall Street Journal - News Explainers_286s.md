# Why Crypto’s Crash Hasn’t Spilled Into Other Markets  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao)
*  There's been a domino effect in the collapse of the crypto industry. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=0.0s)]
*  The fall of the stablecoin Terra sparked a wave of losses, leading to bankruptcy filings [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=5.04s)]
*  for five major crypto companies, paused withdrawals, and declining value for cryptocurrencies. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=10.620000000000001s)]
*  But... [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=16.64s)]
*  The contagion effects to the wider economy have been limited. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=17.64s)]
*  So there's like massive carnage over here, but not much impact over here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=21.16s)]
*  Usually when an industry collapses, it has the potential to ripple far out to other parts [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=26.08s)]
*  of the economy and can even spark a financial crisis. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=31.839999999999996s)]
*  But so far for crypto, the fallout has been pretty contained. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=35.64s)]
*  Here's why the crypto industry's collapse has happened in a closed loop. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=39.72s)]
*  The finances of many crypto companies are intertwined. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=45.8s)]
*  It's a very incestuous kind of scene where you have the same companies lending to each [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=49.76s)]
*  other, borrowing from each other, and then trading with each other. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=53.68s)]
*  Just looking at a slice of the industry, you can see how closely related those five bankrupt [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=57.6s)]
*  companies were. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=62.08s)]
*  Three Arrows, a crypto-focused hedge fund, had invested in crypto assets and companies [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=63.64s)]
*  and took loans out from other companies. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=68.88s)]
*  One of these investments was Terra's sister token, Luna. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=71.4s)]
*  When these assets fell, so did Three Arrows' balance sheet. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=74.88s)]
*  As a result, the company failed to repay debts and was ordered to liquidate in June. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=78.8s)]
*  In the wake of that bankruptcy, crypto lenders BlockFi, Voyager, and Celsius were taking [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=84.0s)]
*  losses on declining digital currency prices and on loans they had given to Three Arrows. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=89.36s)]
*  Then crypto exchange FTX extended a line of credit to BlockFi and its sister company, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=95.08s)]
*  Alameda, extended a line to Voyager. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=99.84s)]
*  Voyager filed for bankruptcy in July. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=102.12s)]
*  A few days later, Celsius did too. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=104.72s)]
*  And when FTX filed for bankruptcy in November, due to a mismanagement of funds, BlockFi [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=107.84s)]
*  followed. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  It's like these companies are all wearing these different hats with each other. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  So you can see how these companies are so interconnected and so intermingled that it [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  sets the stage for contagion to have a really devastating effect. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  The Financial Stability Oversight Council said in a report in October that this interconnectedness [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=126.76s)]
*  is part of why the industry can crumble so quickly. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=132.12s)]
*  One of the reasons those companies are so tightly linked, traditional finance institutions [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=135.88s)]
*  have stayed pretty separated from crypto. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=140.48s)]
*  For example, if you look at the list of some of Celsius's biggest creditors in their bankruptcy [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=143.16s)]
*  filing, there aren't any banks listed. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=147.72s)]
*  In other industries, for example, banks will provide credit lines or arrange corporate [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=150.28s)]
*  bonds or do other sorts of financings. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=155.76s)]
*  In crypto, it's been much more limited. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=158.12s)]
*  There just hasn't been the same embrace that other industries have seen. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=160.24s)]
*  A small handful of banks like these have courted crypto companies, but big players in the financial [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=164.2s)]
*  market have been more hesitant. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=170.0s)]
*  I'm a major skeptic on crypto tokens, which you call currency like Bitcoin. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=171.92s)]
*  Regulation for banks, which is help set by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=177.32s)]
*  requires them to have a number of safety measures in place before engaging with digital assets. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=181.88s)]
*  The resilience of the traditional banking system to the recent events in crypto is not [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=186.84s)]
*  an accident. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=190.88s)]
*  Rather, it is due, at least in part, to federal bank regulators continued and intentional [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=192.04s)]
*  emphasis on safety and soundness and consumer protection. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=197.96s)]
*  Crypto makes up just 0.01 percent of exposure for banks. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=201.6s)]
*  Since the traditional Wall Street banks have not really participated in the space, it's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=205.68s)]
*  been left to the crypto companies themselves to act as like de facto banks within the space. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  You see how these companies have become so interconnected and intermingled that the failure [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=217.52s)]
*  of one can bring down the rest. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=222.52s)]
*  But that isolation has helped prevent the crypto crisis from spilling into the larger [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  economy. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=229.28s)]
*  Think about the housing crash in 2007 that eventually led to the Great Recession. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=230.28s)]
*  When housing prices declined, it sparked a crisis in subprime loans. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=234.84s)]
*  As some banks had a stake in these type of mortgages, that crisis leaked into the traditional [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=239.12s)]
*  financial system. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=243.72s)]
*  It began to snowball and cause a system wide meltdown. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=245.04s)]
*  And major financial institutions like Lehman Brothers failed because of their exposure [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  to the housing market. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=253.84s)]
*  Other industries like housing also have value in the economy. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  There's dollars behind it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=258.64s)]
*  But crypto's value is still mostly speculative. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=260.44s)]
*  This is what happens when you have a lot of money pouring into an unregulated industry [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=263.8s)]
*  that has little discernible clear value aside from the speculation itself. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  While the crash has been mostly contained in this case, it's left a lot of questions [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=275.2s)]
*  about how financial institutions might interact with the industry in the future. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4Pw1uB1ao&t=279.12s)]
