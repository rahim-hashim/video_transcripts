# Why Venezuela Wants to Annex Over Half of Guyana | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0)
*  Venezuela unveiled its new national map in December, adding an area the size of Florida to its territory. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=0.0s)]
*  But this land, called the Ezequibo, belongs to Guyana, a country rich in gold and diamonds. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=7.0s)]
*  It is now one of the world's fastest growing crude oil producers. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=13.0s)]
*  For more than a century, Venezuela has laid claim to the territory. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=18.0s)]
*  Alexin Ezequibo is practically wiping Guyana off of the map. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=22.0s)]
*  I'm here in Caracas trying to understand more about President Maduro's plans to take over this land [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=28.0s)]
*  and what it means in this region as these two oil-rich countries clash. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=34.0s)]
*  The dispute for the Ezequibo dates back to the 19th century, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=42.0s)]
*  when Great Britain acquired Guyana and expanded its territory to the west. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=46.0s)]
*  But Venezuela protested, saying the Ezequibo was part of its territory under Spanish rule. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=50.0s)]
*  Tensions between the two countries intensified in 1966 when Guyana gained independence from Britain. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=57.0s)]
*  Guyana has since sought a resolution through the International Court of Justice, but Venezuela rejects the procedure. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=63.0s)]
*  The Ezequibo makes up two-thirds of Guyana and is mostly covered in rainforest. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=72.0s)]
*  The territory has large reserves of gold and diamonds. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=77.0s)]
*  The Ezequibo region contributed to the country's economic wealth. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=81.0s)]
*  Our forest is an important resource. We have large deposits of gold reserves. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=85.0s)]
*  But a turning point came in 2015 when oil was found off the Ezequibo coast. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=92.0s)]
*  Since then, a consortium led by the U.S. oil giant ExxonMobil said it has discovered up to 11 billion barrels of oil and natural gas resources. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=98.0s)]
*  Oil executives say that this was the largest discovery of the decade. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=108.0s)]
*  It could give the country the highest oil output per capita in the world, ahead of oil-rich Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=112.0s)]
*  Guyana, it's interesting because it's a new producer. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=120.0s)]
*  It's a country where until 2015 no one knew that there was oil. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=124.0s)]
*  And it has started to produce and is a non-OPEC member, which is very important. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=128.0s)]
*  And it includes its possibility to already deliver oil to the market in a market that is restricted because of all the sanctions that exist in Russia. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=133.0s)]
*  Because of its newfound oil revenues, Guyana had the highest real GDP growth in the world in 2022, 62.3 percent. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=144.0s)]
*  And the International Monetary Fund predicts its GDP will keep growing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=154.0s)]
*  Guyana went from one of South America's poorest countries to having one of the world's fastest growing economies. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=160.0s)]
*  We're poised to earn on average about $5 to $6 billion per annum by 2035. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=167.0s)]
*  But Venezuela's president, Nicolas Maduro, says the oil reserves in the Ezequibo belong to his country. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=175.0s)]
*  While Guyana reaps from the oil windfall, Venezuela's economy has contracted 80 percent since Maduro came to office in 2013. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=182.0s)]
*  Nearly 8 million Venezuelans have fled in the past decade. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=191.0s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of them wound up in the U.S. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=194.0s)]
*  In order to oust Maduro, the U.S. imposed sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry in 2019. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=199.0s)]
*  The Biden administration agreed to temporarily lift some economic sanctions on Venezuela in October in exchange for democratic reforms, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=206.0s)]
*  which include allowing opposition candidates to run in this year's presidential election. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=214.0s)]
*  U.S. officials said that allowing more oil and gas money to flow in could help stabilize Venezuela and ease the large flow of migrants. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=220.0s)]
*  But when it comes to the Ezequibo dispute, Washington is not on Venezuela's side. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=229.0s)]
*  The State Department said it supports Guyana, which has held meetings with officials from the U.S. Defense Department to increase cooperation. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=234.0s)]
*  In December, Venezuela's government said more than 10 million voters approved annexing Ezequibo in a referendum. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=244.0s)]
*  But election experts have cast doubts on the veracity of the results, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=255.0s)]
*  especially in a country where the government has been accused of widespread electoral fraud in past elections. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=260.0s)]
*  The only winner is the people of Venezuela, the dignity of Venezuela, the sovereignty of Venezuela. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=266.0s)]
*  And the only losers are the government of Guyana, the foreign country, the North American Empire. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=274.0s)]
*  After the referendum, Maduro ordered the country's state-owned companies to explore and exploit the oil, gas, and mines in the Ezequibo, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=284.0s)]
*  and told foreign companies that they have three months to abandon their operations in the region. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=293.0s)]
*  Guyana views this as an imminent threat to its territorial integrity and will intensify precautionary measures. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=299.0s)]
*  As tensions started to rise, the U.K. sent a warship to support Guyana, and Maduro responded with air and naval exercises near the border. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=308.0s)]
*  Experts said the referendum was largely a wag-the-dog moment for Maduro, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=317.0s)]
*  as he tries to rally nationalist support ahead of the presidential election later this year. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=322.0s)]
*  It's a typical strategy of a dictator autocrat of finding a problem to distract people from their reality, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=328.0s)]
*  which is a completely devastated economic situation and a horrible humanitarian situation. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=336.0s)]
*  The leaders of Guyana and Venezuela have met to discuss the annexation and agreed to avoid conflict. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=341.0s)]
*  But Guyana refused Maduro's plans to settle the dispute through bilateral negotiations, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=348.0s)]
*  asking the U.N. to intervene and lay Venezuela's claims to rest. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=353.0s)]
*  But experts say the case is likely to drag on for years. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=359.0s)]
*  The U.N. has been in the hands of the U.S. and the U.S. for more than a decade. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=363.0s)]
*  The U.S. has been in the hands of the U.S. and the U.S. for more than a decade. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=368.0s)]
*  The U.S. has been in the hands of the U.S. and the U.S. for more than a decade. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHehP0eNY-0&t=372.0s)]
