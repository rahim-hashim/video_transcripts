# How Did America’s Crumbling Water Infrastructure Get So Bad? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464)
*  Every two minutes, there's a water main break somewhere in the country's more than 2.2 million miles of pipes, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=0.0s)]
*  according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=5.84s)]
*  It's just one symptom of the country's crumbling water infrastructure. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=8.64s)]
*  Lead in the water supply in Flint, Michigan. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=12.4s)]
*  The water crisis in Jackson. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Tonight, America's fourth largest city is under a boil water order. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=16.72s)]
*  But it's not just the leaking pipes and contaminated drinking water. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Dams and levees that protect communities from severe floods are also at risk. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=23.92s)]
*  So what are some of the structural factors driving these problems? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=28.16s)]
*  Here's a look at how decades of underinvestment brought America's water infrastructure to a tipping point. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=31.6s)]
*  Typically, bridges, roads and subways are funded by federal taxes, but not water infrastructure. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  Instead, local utilities are responsible for the operation and upkeep of community water systems. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  This financing structure can be traced back to the 1800s, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=51.44s)]
*  when population growth and industrialization led U.S. cities and towns to rapidly expand their water systems for the first time. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=55.12s)]
*  Infrastructure was handled at a local level, not a federal one. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=62.4s)]
*  This led to the sprawling and highly fragmented nature of the country's water systems. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=66.08s)]
*  There are over 50,000 utilities that manage just water. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=70.4s)]
*  Upmanu Lal is a director at Columbia University's water center. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=75.6s)]
*  He has led numerous studies examining the nation's drinking water and wastewater systems. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=79.2s)]
*  We either have really big utilities or thousands of small utilities. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=84.0s)]
*  The problem is that the thousands of small utilities really don't have the technical or financial capacity to manage things very well. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=88.08s)]
*  Today, more than 90 percent of the average utility's revenues come directly from local water bills, according to state water directors. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=95.76s)]
*  But there's a limit to how much money can be raised through bills to make essential upgrades. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=102.88s)]
*  Rate hikes, for instance, often have to be approved by local governments. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  And factors like a shrinking population mean the maintenance costs are spread across fewer ratepayers. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=111.12s)]
*  So as a result, especially in communities that have been declining in population and in communities of color and communities of lower incomes, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=116.56s)]
*  there has been a lack of investment and degradation of the infrastructure. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  Water bills have soared over the last 10 years, along with the costs to fix problems, according to government data. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=130.96s)]
*  So why is water infrastructure becoming increasingly expensive to build and maintain? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=137.36s)]
*  The simple answer, it's too old. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=142.08s)]
*  In 1972, Congress made sweeping revisions to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  This led to significant strides in improving water quality. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=151.12s)]
*  The environmental agenda now before the Congress includes laws to deal with water pollution. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=154.24s)]
*  But the majority of the funding was directed towards construction of new water systems, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  rather than the operation and maintenance of existing systems. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=164.24s)]
*  But the problem that comes with that is that what's your plan for when that infrastructure ages? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=167.84s)]
*  The majority of wastewater treatment systems constructed in the 1970s are today reaching the end of their 40 to 50 year lifespans, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=172.8s)]
*  according to the Environmental Protection Agency. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=180.32s)]
*  Dams are at risk too. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=182.88s)]
*  The ASCE found the amount of high hazard potential dams has more than doubled in the last 20 years. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=184.48s)]
*  This means if a dam were to fail, like in the event of an earthquake or severe storm, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=190.56s)]
*  there would likely be a direct loss of human life. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=195.2s)]
*  Our dams were designed to have a life of 50 to 70 years with good maintenance. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=198.24s)]
*  Today, the median age of U.S. dams is 57 years, and many pipes are even older. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=204.48s)]
*  On average, they're about 45 years old, with some dating back to the 1800s, according to the ASCE. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=210.4s)]
*  So essentially, two thirds of our system is essentially due for replacement. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=216.56s)]
*  And pipes cost a million dollars a mile to replace. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=220.56s)]
*  So if you don't have the million dollars a mile to replace the pipe, what you do is you patch the pipe. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=223.52s)]
*  Then the pipe breaks in another place. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=228.48s)]
*  This becomes like a band-aid approach. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=230.32s)]
*  And so at some point, you just end up with a disaster. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=233.04s)]
*  As pipes aged, water main breaks and boil water advisories became more common. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=236.24s)]
*  In 1987, Congress switched from a grant system to loans. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=241.2s)]
*  Specifically, state revolving funds. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=245.12s)]
*  Before this, federal grants funded up to 75 percent of state water projects. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=247.6s)]
*  The logic there perhaps was that these would be low-interest loans, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=252.4s)]
*  and they would go to communities that are most in need. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=256.72s)]
*  And the concept perhaps was that many of the communities were already taken care of by that point. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=259.36s)]
*  This meant local communities became responsible for the majority of project costs [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=266.32s)]
*  because they were required to repay the loans. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=270.88s)]
*  The City Council will meet to look over a final design on the new water treatment plant [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=273.2s)]
*  and decide whether they should take out a $3.5 million loan to build it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=277.76s)]
*  While spending by state and local governments were on the rise, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  the federal government's share of water spending fell by about 69 percent between 1977 and 2017. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=285.76s)]
*  With limited funds, many cities and towns neglected the repair and replacement of critical water infrastructure. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=292.88s)]
*  The challenge is that if they try to go for the state revolving fund money, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=299.36s)]
*  typically they don't have in-house capacity to develop the proposals needed. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=303.2s)]
*  So it's not a surprise then that the smaller utilities that serve poorer communities often [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  are the ones that are really unable to come up with ways to compete for federal funds [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=315.12s)]
*  or to even compete for products at the right price point. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  As federal funding dried up and systems aged, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=324.4s)]
*  local governments spent more to maintain existing water infrastructure [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=327.28s)]
*  rather than carry out important upgrades. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=331.04s)]
*  Between 1977 to 2017, local governments spent about 70 percent more on the operation [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  and maintenance of systems than on capital expenses to replace or install new infrastructure. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=340.24s)]
*  If you look at how water bills have gone up since 2000 to now, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=345.44s)]
*  they have risen on average twice the rate of inflation across the country. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=351.04s)]
*  Most of this is happening because of the deferred maintenance catching up with people. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  In 2021, President Biden signed an infrastructure bill that sets aside [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  about $55 billion to improve the nation's aging water systems. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=366.16s)]
*  This law is going to start to replace 100 percent of the nation's lead pipes and service lines. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  So every American, every child can turn on the faucet and drink clean water. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=375.76s)]
*  The Biden administration has called it the largest single investment in clean drinking [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  water in American history, but it only covers a fraction of the $472 billion cost identified [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=385.12s)]
*  by the EPA in 2018. Still, there are varying estimates for this price tag. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=391.36s)]
*  There is not a benchmark of this number because we as a nation, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=396.24s)]
*  we have not done the exercise of who is in trouble to what extent. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  So how do you actually source data from 50,000 different utilities [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=403.92s)]
*  in a reasonable way to get an idea of honestly what really is the need? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=408.96s)]
*  As a main focus of the infrastructure bill, White House officials said they are rolling [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=413.52s)]
*  out a new plan to help 10 million U.S. households replace lead water pipes. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7H_DAC464&t=418.0s)]
