# Why Bond Yields Are a Key Economic Barometer | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg)
*  Few things in the economy are more closely watched than bond yields. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=0.0s)]
*  There are forces in play that merit watching. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=4.72s)]
*  Some commodity prices and tenure treasury yields have climbed. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=7.76s)]
*  That's the president of the Federal Reserve of Atlanta last March, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=11.52s)]
*  speaking about how the Fed gauges inflation and why it's keeping a close eye on certain bond yields. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  U.S. government bond yields are a barometer for the economy, but they're also more than that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=21.68s)]
*  U.S. government bond yields are extremely important to the U.S. and even the global economy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=27.28s)]
*  Bond yields affect everything from the cost of a mortgage to the cost of borrowing for businesses. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=32.4s)]
*  If you're borrowing money, that's going to be determined to a large extent by U.S. government bond yields. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=39.6s)]
*  And changes in yields can impact you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=45.84s)]
*  Here's how bond yields work and why they're so crucial to the economy. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=48.56s)]
*  When we talk about a bond yield, we're typically talking about the annualized return an investor earns [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  by holding a bond until its maturity date. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=62.16s)]
*  Let's break this down. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=64.88s)]
*  A bond is a contract with features that are set from the start. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  There's the maturity date, which refers to the length of the bond's life. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=70.0s)]
*  This is generally two to 30 years. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  Bonds that mature between two and 10 years are also called notes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=76.24s)]
*  Then there's its face value, which is the amount the bond is worth when it's first created, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=80.4s)]
*  and the amount it is guaranteed to pay on the maturity date. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=85.12s)]
*  There's also the annual interest rate, otherwise known as the coupon rate. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=88.4s)]
*  This is the fixed amount a bond pays each year up to its maturity date. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=92.64s)]
*  So say an investor buys a new 10-year Treasury note with a face value of $1,000 [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  and a coupon or yield of 4%. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=102.48s)]
*  Every year, the investor will receive $40, and on the 10th year, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=105.76s)]
*  she'll get back the original $1,000 she paid for the bond. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=113.92s)]
*  As soon as she buys that bond, she can sell it to other investors. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=115.28s)]
*  And when she does, certain features of the bond are subject to change. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=119.6s)]
*  If the economy is doing well, interest rates may go up, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=123.84s)]
*  which means new bonds will be issued at a higher yield, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=127.36s)]
*  bringing down the value of existing bonds. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=130.24s)]
*  Say a new batch of 10-year Treasuries pay a yield of 5%. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=133.28s)]
*  Suddenly, this bond is less attractive to investors, and the price has dropped. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=137.6s)]
*  When the price goes down, the yield goes up. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=142.56s)]
*  And when interest rates go down, this same dynamic happens in reverse. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=145.04s)]
*  The inverse relationship between the price of a bond and its yield [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=149.28s)]
*  is key to understanding why investors care so much about bond yields, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=152.88s)]
*  and why you sometimes see yields and stocks both going up at the same time. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=157.36s)]
*  Investors generally like bonds because they are a safe investment. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  The problem is that that return is going to be often lower, much lower than stocks. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=166.72s)]
*  Sam Goldfarb covers changes in bond yields and how they're connected to financial markets [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=171.12s)]
*  and the economy. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=175.84s)]
*  If investors are confident about the economy, they might not be satisfied with the small return [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=176.88s)]
*  they can get from U.S. government bonds. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=182.4s)]
*  They might choose to buy stocks instead. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=184.24s)]
*  But climbing Treasury yields also signal that borrowing is getting more expensive. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=186.4s)]
*  It's basically a proxy for longer-term interest rates. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=191.28s)]
*  If you want to get a rough sense of where your mortgage rates are going to be going, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=195.6s)]
*  you might look at the 10-year Treasury note and its yield. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=200.32s)]
*  Bond yields aren't just watched by economists and investors. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=203.2s)]
*  The Federal Reserve keeps a close eye on them as well. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=206.48s)]
*  And they're not just watching. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=209.68s)]
*  Bond yields are a key part of monetary policy that the Fed uses to help influence the economy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  There's been an underlying sense of an improved economic outlook, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=217.04s)]
*  and that has to be part of why rates would move back up from the extraordinarily low levels they were at. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=221.12s)]
*  That's the chairman of the Federal Reserve in March 2021, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=227.28s)]
*  talking about the rise in bond yields during the economic crisis. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=230.8s)]
*  In 2020, the Fed had slashed short-term interest rates at controls to zero [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=234.48s)]
*  in an effort to bolster the economy and encourage spending. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=238.96s)]
*  And bond yields, which are heavily influenced by the outlook of short-term interest rates, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=242.24s)]
*  also fell to record lows. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=246.96s)]
*  Two years later, much of the economy has rebounded. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=249.2s)]
*  The economy has rapidly gained strength despite the ongoing pandemic, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=252.72s)]
*  giving rise to persistent supply and demand imbalances in bottlenecks and to elevated inflation. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=256.88s)]
*  Last December, inflation rose 7% from a year earlier, the fastest pace since 1982. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=263.36s)]
*  This reflected rapidly rising prices on everything from houses to groceries. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=269.84s)]
*  And when the Fed wants to restrain an overheated economy, it raises short-term interest rates. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  And when interest rates rise, bond yields go up as well. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=280.24s)]
*  Inflation is uncomfortably high. People don't like that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=284.16s)]
*  The Fed has a goal of keeping prices stable. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  And so it'll try to cool the economy by raising borrowing costs. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=290.8s)]
*  Higher interest rates can send up the price of mortgages and other loans, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  which will likely slow down consumer spending. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=300.16s)]
*  This sounds like a bad thing, but only to a point. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=303.2s)]
*  Higher bond yields can help cool down the economy, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=306.24s)]
*  which should bring down inflation in the long term. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8vIvwYzFg&t=309.2s)]
