Video Description: Super-tall skyscrapers are being built in cities around the world where they may normally sink, and builders are using a unique engineering method called deep-soil mixing to make it happen. Mixing soil and cement creates a super-strong slurry called “soilcrete” that is three times stronger than regular soil.

WSJ explains the process of essentially changing the earth, and the risks it poses as cities expand.

# The Construction Method That Can Prevent Skyscrapers From Sinking  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s)
*  Big Ben is tilting to the north and keeps leaning about a millimeter a year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=0.0s)]
*  The 58-story Millennium Tower in San Francisco has sunk over a foot since it opened in 2009, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=6.04s)]
*  according to a lawsuit. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=11.92s)]
*  And the former construction manager for this 57-story, $77 million building in Manhattan [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=13.4s)]
*  said it's leaning about three inches. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=19.52s)]
*  Its developer says it's structurally stable. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=22.26s)]
*  Still, the building sits unfinished. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=24.88s)]
*  The Millennium Tower has undergone a $100 million construction project to fix the unanticipated [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=27.64s)]
*  movement according to its owner. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=33.76s)]
*  These issues all have one main cause — the ground. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=36.28s)]
*  So to build taller buildings on imperfect soil, developers are using an old technology [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=40.44s)]
*  for a new purpose. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=46.2s)]
*  It's called deep soil mixing. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  I think it's been a game changer, a completely game changer. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=49.96s)]
*  But there are risks. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=53.44s)]
*  Here's how it works. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=54.84s)]
*  The incredible weight of skyscrapers requires a strong foundation to stand on. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=57.36s)]
*  In Miami, Andres Baccarizo is helping to build the city's first super-tall skyscraper, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=62.56s)]
*  the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and Residences Miami, on ground that looks like this — layers [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=67.8s)]
*  of porous limestone and sand. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=73.32s)]
*  Not ideal for a 100-story tower. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=76.02s)]
*  So Baccarizo and the team are literally changing the earth using deep soil mixing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=78.82s)]
*  At the end, what you end up doing is improving the capacity of the soil to withstand better [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=84.8s)]
*  loads and support buildings or different conditions. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=88.64s)]
*  To do this, workers bring in a high-torque, or really powerful, drill rig. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=92.32s)]
*  This big blade carves out wells in the ground that can be up to 110 feet deep. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=97.5s)]
*  Here they'll be around 40. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=103.08s)]
*  Imagine your kitchen blender. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=104.64s)]
*  But in this case, it's a 9- to 10-foot diameter blender. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=106.32s)]
*  This blender has some blades that are going around the ground, and it's shooting cement [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=109.28s)]
*  through those blades. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=113.36s)]
*  Then, cement mixes with the soil to form a super-strong slurry called soil creep, giving [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=114.76s)]
*  the soil a higher load capacity. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=120.0s)]
*  So what you end up taking is a soil that would only have a certain amount of capacity, and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=122.8s)]
*  you increase the compression capacity, the lateral capacity on it, and you're going [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=126.68s)]
*  to make it really stiff. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=130.52s)]
*  Making it stiff and almost impermeable. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=131.84s)]
*  These wells are arranged in an overlapping grid so that all of the soil is properly mixed. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=134.2s)]
*  Every one of these cells, that little circle there that seems little, is really between [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=140.0s)]
*  9- to 10-foot diameter. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=144.44s)]
*  It also makes the ground almost impervious to water, which at water-side properties like [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=145.98s)]
*  the Waldorf Astoria, means you don't have to fight the tide. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=150.96s)]
*  Before, when you were having the water being run, it's a race against the water to see [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=154.4s)]
*  when you can do the work if you're going to have a high tide, low tide. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=158.64s)]
*  Deep soil mixing can also help buildings withstand natural disasters, like earthquakes and the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=162.12s)]
*  hurricanes seen in Miami, when wind can cause problems for super-tall buildings. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=167.96s)]
*  What happens typically with winds is that it will push the building to try to tilt, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=173.84s)]
*  and when it's tilting, it's literally pushing the building sideways. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=178.08s)]
*  But more importantly, in the foundation, if you realize if it's going this way, one side [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=181.24s)]
*  is pushing and the other one is lifting. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=185.52s)]
*  So now you have a tension condition and a compression condition. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=187.56s)]
*  If you increase the capacity of the piles to not be bent laterally and increase the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=191.28s)]
*  compression capacity and a little bit of the tension, it's going to end up helping [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=195.2s)]
*  the building to be more stable. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=199.0s)]
*  Deep soil mixing's ground-hardening abilities not only make a building like this possible, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=201.1s)]
*  they make it more profitable. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  For example, developers have been able to add more high-floor condos than they would [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  have if the building was shorter. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  They'll start at $10 million each and will look like these renderings. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  More people are willing to say, you know what, it's interesting, let's go for it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=218.72s)]
*  So you're beginning to see this increase of the size of the city and the height of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=221.88s)]
*  the buildings. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=225.32s)]
*  The construction company building the Waldorf Astoria Tower is now using deep soil mixing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=226.32s)]
*  for shorter residential projects across the country and around the world. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  They've used it here, here, and here to prevent soil shifting under skyscrapers. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=235.84s)]
*  And that's just one company's projects. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=242.64s)]
*  Other companies also have projects underway across the globe. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=245.3s)]
*  But the method comes with some risks. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=249.36s)]
*  So if a building was demolished to be able to put a new building and they left anything [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=252.0s)]
*  made by man, the big blender is coming into the ground and shooting cement will hit this [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=255.68s)]
*  obstruction and may shift out of location or damage the tool. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=260.16s)]
*  If you get shift out of location and you don't realize that it happened, then during the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=263.2s)]
*  excavation process you will end up getting some water intrusion. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  That's when water flows into the excavation. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=270.08000000000004s)]
*  A small amount is normal, but any flow larger than a garden hose can be hard to fix. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=272.36s)]
*  Take a nearby Miami project, Una Residences, as an example. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=278.04s)]
*  In March 2022, water entered the unfinished foundation during deep soil mixing, creating [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=282.12s)]
*  what looked like a lagoon and concerning residents. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  The developers said that construction is back underway. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=291.38s)]
*  And some land, like beach sand, is just too soft for deep soil mixing. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=295.44s)]
*  If the technique is used on soil that's not quite right, the layer of soilcrete can crack. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=300.20000000000005s)]
*  When it begins to break, the difficult thing is in most cases you almost have to start [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=306.32s)]
*  from scratch. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=310.12s)]
*  Because if you already found you have a weakness, it's not something you can reinforce, as [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=311.12s)]
*  the water will always want to come in. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=315.84s)]
*  Previously, deep soil mixing was mainly used for industrial sites like oil refineries, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=318.12s)]
*  where the land needed to hold heavy equipment. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=323.28s)]
*  Miami was the first city where at some point the industry realized that this condition [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=326.4s)]
*  could help us improve the capacity of the onsite soils. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=331.84s)]
*  And from Miami that has been developing, it's now beginning to go into other places [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=334.48s)]
*  of the world. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  But due to the unique engineering challenges that Miami's sandy soil presents, Andres's [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=339.16s)]
*  team of engineers are paying close attention to the construction. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  The progress the team makes here will help inform the company's engineers around the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=348.24s)]
*  globe on how to make more stable ground for their buildings. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=352.72s)]
*  As we use it more, we have been able to understand better the system, to keep using their benefits [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  into the benefit of the buildings. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=363.28s)]
*  So for me it has been a game changer. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxsZrVXGa2s&t=364.91999999999996s)]
