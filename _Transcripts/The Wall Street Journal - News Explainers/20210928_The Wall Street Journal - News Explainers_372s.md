# How Cardano’s Ada, an Alternative to Bitcoin, Cracked the Crypto Market  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 28, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo)
*  Bitcoin and Ethereum. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=0.0s)]
*  So you know the top two players in crypto. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=2.6s)]
*  But what about the Cardano network's coin ADA? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=5.0200000000000005s)]
*  ADA is an altcoin, meaning it's an alternative to Bitcoin, and is named after the 19th century [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=8.08s)]
*  mathematician Ada Lovelace, who is considered the first computer programmer. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=13.84s)]
*  Late this summer, a surge in interest in ADA pushed the cryptocurrency to the third largest, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  behind Bitcoin and Ether, Ethereum's currency. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=24.28s)]
*  During the rise, ADA reached a market capitalization of more than $90 billion and rose to a high [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=27.52s)]
*  of more than $3. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=33.72s)]
*  That's nearly a 2,500% increase in price on a year-over-year basis. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=35.68s)]
*  That's primarily driven by retail investors, and I think a lot of the ones that I talked [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=41.84s)]
*  to were saying, I want to kind of find the next Bitcoin, so maybe that's Cardano's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=45.44s)]
*  ADA token. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=50.56s)]
*  Given the crypto market's volatility, the third largest change is often. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=51.56s)]
*  But with nearly 6,000 cryptocurrencies in existence this year, why is Cardano's ADA [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=55.72s)]
*  one of the few breaking through? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=61.4s)]
*  We'll explain. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=64.36s)]
*  Cardano describes itself as a third-generation blockchain platform. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=67.0s)]
*  You can think about the blockchain generations similar to the evolution of the cell phone. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=71.02s)]
*  Bitcoin, the first generation, is like the flip phone. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=75.56s)]
*  It was revolutionary in its creation, but only does basic things. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  The second generation, Ethereum 1.0, that's like your first few smartphones. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=83.6s)]
*  It offers apps, but is kind of slow to load. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=88.6s)]
*  The third generation, Cardano and Ethereum 2.0, want to be more like phones today, where [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=92.0s)]
*  speed and usability are crucial. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=97.24s)]
*  The key difference between the first generation and the third has to do with how the network [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  works. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  Bitcoin runs on something called a proof-of-work mechanism, which runs something like this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  Miners. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=111.68s)]
*  Not those ones. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=112.68s)]
*  But people who set up computers allow the system to work. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=114.0s)]
*  Their computers simultaneously race to guess a complex sequence of numbers in order to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  validate a block of transactions. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  The miner whose computer wins is awarded bitcoin and records the validated transaction on the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  blockchain ledger, a fancy word that essentially means the online record book. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=130.76000000000002s)]
*  But as bitcoin prices rise, so do the barriers to entry for miners. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=135.68s)]
*  So we're seeing companies fully dedicated to mining. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=140.16s)]
*  We're seeing miners taking over warehouses and factories to set up mining facilities. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=143.72s)]
*  While secure, this system requires huge amounts of processing power, simply because it requires [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=150.4s)]
*  all mining computers to work on the same puzzle. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=156.4s)]
*  And it rewards those with more computing power. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  Just how much power? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=162.54s)]
*  In a year, the bitcoin network uses about the same amount of electricity as Washington [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=164.35999999999999s)]
*  State. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=168.84s)]
*  So we're seeing proof-of-work increasingly come under scrutiny because of the energy [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=169.84s)]
*  intensity that it uses. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=174.08s)]
*  This is one of the biggest challenges of the first generation of crypto and a main reason [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=176.0s)]
*  why Cardano is breaking through. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  Cardano uses a different system called proof-of-stake, a system also adopted by Ethereum's second [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=183.24s)]
*  model, Ethereum 2.0, which is expected to be fully rolled out in the future. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=188.96s)]
*  The proof-of-stake model is, I think, a very exciting prospect for people who are in the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=193.96s)]
*  space because it uses an entirely different system in order to verify transactions on [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=200.52s)]
*  the blockchain. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=205.8s)]
*  In Cardano's proof-of-stake model, ADA owners use their own holdings to help validate transactions. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=206.8s)]
*  This is called staking or delegating. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=213.08s)]
*  Think of a stake as a commitment to keep the Cardano network operating and secure. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=215.3s)]
*  To earn ADA, users join a stake pool, either one they've made or another user's. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=219.8s)]
*  Not every user in a stake pool is responsible for verifying transactions. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=225.52s)]
*  Instead, one user, a pool operator, does the work on behalf of the group, cutting down [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  on computer activity. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=235.44s)]
*  So in short, in first generation crypto, every computer races to solve one math puzzle. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=236.96s)]
*  In third generation, only the stake pool operator does the work. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=242.52s)]
*  But the proof-of-stake system isn't the only factor that helped Cardano break through. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=246.8s)]
*  Cardano recently introduced something called smart contracts to its system with an upgrade [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=252.8s)]
*  it calls Alonzo. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=257.64s)]
*  Smart contracts are seen as game changers because they allow the blockchain to host [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  other operations. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  Again, think of a smartphone. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  It's similar to the idea of an app store, except with a blockchain, these apps are called [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=266.88s)]
*  DApps or decentralized apps. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=271.16s)]
*  And there is no company like Apple or Google in between the user and the application. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=273.96s)]
*  Instead, the smart contract has programmed code to facilitate agreements and transactions [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=278.68s)]
*  between the user and the DApp. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=284.79999999999995s)]
*  Users hope Cardano's adoption will allow it to better compete with the Ethereum network, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=287.4s)]
*  where about 80% of DApps are built. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  But all that traffic has created issues. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  The reason that Ethereum has faced some scrutiny this year is just because there's been so [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=298.0s)]
*  much activity on the network that there's been more congestion and higher transaction [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  fees in order to try to transact on the network. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=308.8s)]
*  So the idea for Cardano is to take the Ethereum model and make it more scalable. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  While Cardano's promises may sound great in theory, they've yet to undergo the most important [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=318.44s)]
*  test, time. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=323.6s)]
*  We'll have to wait and see how successful people are able to use the platform in order [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=325.36s)]
*  to build decentralized applications and create non-fungible tokens. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=331.16s)]
*  The introduction of smart contracts is stage three in a five-part plan, according to the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=337.56s)]
*  platform's roadmap. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=342.48s)]
*  Still to come are upgrades on scalability and governance. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  Investors have to keep in mind this is not going to be a steady investment. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=348.20000000000005s)]
*  But I think people who like to trade amid volatility, that's one of the draws. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=352.92s)]
*  The blockchain engineering company behind Cardano, IOHK, warned that expectations need [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=357.32s)]
*  to be managed with this upgrade. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=362.8s)]
*  So how smart contracts will impact Cardano in the long run? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=364.8s)]
*  Time will have to tell. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKnEZYCkTo&t=369.12s)]
