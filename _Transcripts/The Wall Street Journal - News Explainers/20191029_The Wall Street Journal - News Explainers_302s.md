# Repo: How Roughly $1 Trillion Moves Overnight | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 29, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM)
*  Take a look at this chart. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=0.0s)]
*  It tracks how much banks and others pay for overnight loans using something called repurchase agreements. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=3.36s)]
*  This is also known as the repo rate. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=10.0s)]
*  These bumps right here on September 16th and 17th have caused a really big stir in the financial world. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=13.0s)]
*  That's because the repo market is a critical part of the financial system. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=20.32s)]
*  It provides a lot of the grease that keeps the wheels spinning, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=25.0s)]
*  meaning it provides the cash that financial firms need to run their daily operations. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  When the repo market chokes and cash stops flowing, trouble can reverberate through the economy. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  That's what happened in September. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=39.76s)]
*  And in response, the Federal Reserve had to step into help, providing tens of billions of dollars to borrowers to keep the system cranking. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=41.92s)]
*  In the weeks since this happened, experts have called the incident a technical malfunction. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=49.84s)]
*  And banks, for their part, have said it could have been prevented. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=55.08s)]
*  They're blaming the rules that were put in place after the financial crisis, rules intended to keep the banking system from falling apart. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=58.68s)]
*  Imagine two people, Karen and Mark. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=72.36s)]
*  Karen has a thousand dollars and she'd like to earn some fast interest on her money. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=75.84s)]
*  Mark has a stack of Treasury notes, but no cash. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=80.6s)]
*  So he strikes a deal with Karen. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=84.68s)]
*  One note for a hundred dollars. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=86.76s)]
*  But there's a catch. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=89.84s)]
*  Mark has to agree to buy that note back tomorrow for a hundred and one dollars. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=91.4s)]
*  The difference between the price of the note on day one and day two, that's the repo rate. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=96.28s)]
*  If everything works properly, Mark gets the cash he needs right when he needs it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=102.08s)]
*  And Karen makes some fast money. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=106.84s)]
*  The repo market functions in the same way. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=109.0s)]
*  You just have to replace the Karens with money market funds and other asset managers who are looking to make a little money without a lot of risk. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=111.72000000000001s)]
*  And replace the Marks with hedge funds, Wall Street traders and banks who have a lot of assets, but need cash on hand to fund their day to day trading. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=118.92s)]
*  In the repo market, Karen's and Mark's all over the financial system, lend back and forth for short periods, often overnight. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=128.52s)]
*  And they do this at an enormous scale. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=136.04000000000002s)]
*  Usually more than one trillion dollars runs through it every day. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=138.76s)]
*  On September 16th and 17th, when the rate spiked, the Karens were not willing to trade cash for securities at the usual rate. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=143.6s)]
*  So the Marks, who needed cash, kept offering more and more and more until the Fed arrived with help. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  When the Fed announced its surprise repo operations, people wanted to know, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=162.4s)]
*  why did the Karens suddenly stop lending? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=167.32s)]
*  Experts point to two financial deadlines that sapped cash out of the system on the same night, causing a crunch. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=171.48s)]
*  September 16th was the cutoff for banks to submit their quarterly tax payments. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=178.64s)]
*  So a lot of money that they might usually lend in the repo market was being sucked out of their accounts and deposited into the Treasury. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  September 16th was also the day that 78 billion dollars of Treasury debt was scheduled to settle, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  which just means that another chunk of cash was being turned into securities on that day, too. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=197.16s)]
*  Now, some banks said the crunch was compounded by another factor, a rule put in place after the financial crisis to keep banks solvent. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  The rule, which is called liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR, requires banks to keep a certain amount of reserves or cash on hold at the Fed at all times, among other things. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=212.04s)]
*  The idea was to improve the banking sector's ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=223.48s)]
*  You can see it on this chart. Since the crisis, banks have stockpiled cash in the reserve accounts. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=231.12s)]
*  Their argument is that keeping these funds on hold makes it harder for them to lend out cash on a dime when money gets tight. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=237.28s)]
*  Now, for the Fed's part, Chairman Jerome Powell dismissed the possibility of revisiting those rules. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=244.88s)]
*  If we concluded that we needed to raise the level of required reserves for banks to meet the LCR, we'd probably raise the level of reserves rather than lower the LCR. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=250.64s)]
*  What he's saying is that the Fed would rather provide the extra funds itself than lower those liquidity requirements for banks. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  And since that press conference, the Fed's done just that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=270.8s)]
*  In October, it announced it would start buying short-term Treasury debt at 60 billion dollars a month. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=274.88s)]
*  And continue through at least June of 2020, which means there's going to be money to borrow even if the Cairns stop lending again. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=280.76s)]
*  Its aim is to boost reserves, allowing banks to stay liquid without violating the rule and in doing so, to keep the wheels of the financial system spinning. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCkXNrjFQM&t=288.24s)]
