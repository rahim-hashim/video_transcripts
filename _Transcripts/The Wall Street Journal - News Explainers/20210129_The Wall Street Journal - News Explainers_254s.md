# How Options-Trading Redditors Fed the GameStop Frenzy | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 29, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc)
*  This video was posted this week on Wall Street Bets, a Reddit forum dedicated to discussing stock and options trading. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=0.0s)]
*  This little rocket represents GME, the stock ticker for video game retailer GameStop. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=7.24s)]
*  For weeks, users of the subreddit have been encouraging each other to scoop up shares and make bullish wagers on the stock. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=12.76s)]
*  In less than a month, GME rose from under $20 a share to well over [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=19.92s)]
*  $300 on some days before falling on Thursday after brokers placed restrictions on trading. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=24.46s)]
*  Wall Street has been totally stunned by what's happened with GameStop. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=31.5s)]
*  This has basically never happened before. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=34.84s)]
*  Alexander Osipovich covers futures and stock exchanges for The Wall Street Journal and has explored the forces behind GameStop's dramatic swings. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=37.34s)]
*  GameStop has become a battleground between small investors who are banding together on online forums like Reddit and professional investors who are [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=45.58s)]
*  shorting the stock or betting that will fall. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=53.54s)]
*  Here's what's going on with GameStop. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=56.06s)]
*  Wall Street Bets is one of the most popular forums on Reddit. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=58.9s)]
*  It's a place where people get together, share trading ideas and go after particular stocks in a kind of coordinated fashion. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=62.34s)]
*  They can cause a big run up in that stock's price. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=69.62s)]
*  In recent weeks, investors on Wall Street Bets have targeted GameStop's short sellers who saw the company as overpriced and were betting the shares would fall. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=72.5s)]
*  The Wall Street Bets crowd was buying up shares and betting the opposite, causing the stock to go on a wild ride. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=81.42s)]
*  Behind that is a couple of things. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=87.34s)]
*  One of them is momentum trading. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=89.62s)]
*  That's when people chase games. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=91.7s)]
*  They see a stock is going up, they buy more of it because it'll likely keep going up. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=93.22s)]
*  But while the rise might have appeared to be as simple as average investors buying shares and pumping up the price, it also had to do with options. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=97.34s)]
*  Options are contracts that allow investors to buy or sell a stock at a specified price, either on or until a specified date. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=105.58s)]
*  It has gotten a lot easier and cheaper for people to trade options over the past few years. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=114.38s)]
*  Now the world is your trading floor. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=119.42s)]
*  Commissions have come down and brokers have invested a lot of time and effort into making easy to use interfaces to allow people to buy and sell them and even do complex strategies. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=121.74000000000001s)]
*  Options trading volume set a record last year, averaging just under 30 million contracts a day. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=132.26000000000002s)]
*  This year, that number is over 40 million. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=138.18s)]
*  Options come in two forms. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  Put options confer the right to sell shares under specified terms and call options confer the right to buy them. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=143.70000000000002s)]
*  Many of the Wall Street's bets users were buying call options to bet that the price would rise. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=151.06s)]
*  Look at the market on Tuesday, January 26th, for example. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=156.26000000000002s)]
*  GameStop closed at just under $148. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=159.82s)]
*  At that moment, call options to buy GameStop shares at $200 apiece by Friday were trading at just $19 a share. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=163.22s)]
*  If GameStop rallied, the price of the options might have risen and call holders would have been able to sell these options for a quick profit. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=170.82s)]
*  The question is, why were the shares surging when much of the action was in options? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=178.74s)]
*  It's because when an investor buys a call option, someone else has to sell it to them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=184.14000000000001s)]
*  Typically an electronic trading firm that buys and sells stocks. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=189.22s)]
*  When they sell the investor the call option, they often hedge their bet by purchasing shares of the stock in question. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=193.42000000000002s)]
*  GameStop options trading volumes exploded during the past two weeks, especially for call options, which drove brokers to buy more of the stock, driving it up even further. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=200.78s)]
*  This dynamic isn't just playing out with GameStop. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=211.14000000000001s)]
*  Traders at Wall Street bets moved on to AMC, BlackBerry, and Nokia as well. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=213.62s)]
*  Amid soaring shares, on January 28th, popular online brokerages, including Robinhood and Interactive Brokers Group, restricted access to trading high-flying stocks, including GameStop. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=218.94s)]
*  Shares plunged. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=230.5s)]
*  Trading a stock like GameStop in a situation like this is extremely risky. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=232.29999999999998s)]
*  If you are playing with this stuff, you are playing with fire. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=236.14s)]
*  It's unclear if the authorities have any means of reining this in. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=239.26s)]
*  Wall Street bets users called foul, some pledging to find other ways to participate in the market, regardless of the chaos it causes. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR5cMe_hvc&t=242.9s)]
