# How Russian State Media Is Covering the U.S. Election | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 19, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc)
*  The U.S. election is taking up airtime on Russian state television, as the ballots are still being counted. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=0.0s)]
*  The main outcome of the election is the complete distrust of the American electoral system. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=6.44s)]
*  It is so archaic, so pre-emptive that it cannot be called a democratic language. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Four days after election day, the Associated Press and other media outlets declared former Vice President Joe Biden the winner. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=19.56s)]
*  He had garnered the 270 electoral votes needed to defeat President Trump in the race for the White House. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  But Russia's main television networks are taking extra effort to cast out on Biden's victory in the eyes of its viewers. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=34.0s)]
*  Russian state networks are using the elections as an opportunity to portray American democracy as messy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=44.08s)]
*  In this mess, all hope has already been lost in the account of the honest will of the citizens. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=49.8s)]
*  State media occupies an enormous role in the Russian media landscape. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=56.919999999999995s)]
*  In terms of informing people and informing opinions, it really does play a very large role. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  There are three main themes shaping Russian public opinion about U.S. politics, such as election irregularities, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=66.08s)]
*  the question about who calls the winner, and the stark preview of the new administration. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=73.0s)]
*  The election is in the mail. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=77.72s)]
*  There's no apparent coordination between Russian state media and the Trump campaign. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=81.8s)]
*  But Russian media have echoed a familiar line from the Trump campaign about election irregularities. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=86.0s)]
*  It's amazing how those mail-in ballots are so one-sided. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=91.52s)]
*  The overwhelming majority of 64 million votes sent by mail were miraculously for Biden. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=94.4s)]
*  There has been no evidence of widespread fraud, but the Trump campaign has turned to the courts challenging absentee and mail-in voting procedures. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=104.84s)]
*  While the newscasts appear to support Trump and not Biden, it's ultimately signaling something else to viewers. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=114.08s)]
*  I think that a big part of this is not really to come down on one side or the other, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=120.6s)]
*  but to rather sow doubt in people's minds about the electoral process, about the nature of democracy itself in the United States. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=124.2s)]
*  Russian anchors also have questions about who's calling the results in the U.S. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=135.8s)]
*  For over a century, U.S. presidential elections have been called by news organizations before the official results are announced. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  That's because it can take weeks to certify the results since each state has different rules and regulations. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=152.60000000000002s)]
*  NBC News now projects that Joe Biden... [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=158.2s)]
*  News organizations base their calls on near-complete vote counts by election officials in each state. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=160.11999999999998s)]
*  Plus, the U.S. doesn't have a national elections commission to announce the winner. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=166.0s)]
*  But in Russia, there's a central election commission, and so to Russian viewers, the American way of calling the election is unusual. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=170.48s)]
*  What was it called by? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  All the... Oh, my goodness! All the networks! Wow! [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=180.0s)]
*  I agree with him in this case. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  Biden's critical comments about Russia over the years... [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=187.24s)]
*  Get out of Ukraine! [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  ...are repeated across different political shows. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  He's portrayed as someone who will not be nice or at least neutral to Russia. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=193.52s)]
*  Biden frequently criticized Russia's foreign policy and strongly supported sanctioning Moscow for annexing Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  The focus isn't just on Biden, but also people possibly being considered to join his administration. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=205.84s)]
*  It's not just about the Russian people, although sometimes it seems more like an open hatred, it seems to be in their blood. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=212.0s)]
*  It's not just about the Russian people, although sometimes it seems more like an open hatred, it seems to be in their blood. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=220.08s)]
*  The only thing that's happening now in terms of breaking up our security and our alliances is Russia. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=235.84s)]
*  But Biden has also indicated a willingness to work with the Kremlin on the extension of an arms control treaty, something that Moscow has also shown interest in. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=241.44s)]
*  This is a very serious element of our possible interaction in the future. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=249.76s)]
*  Nearly three out of four Russians get their news from television, and so the message that state media broadcasts send about the future administration reaches large audiences across Russia. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=254.96s)]
*  I think Trump would be the best for Russia. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=265.48s)]
*  I think Trump would be closer to us. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=268.72s)]
*  Beyond who sits in the White House, Russia's rolling coverage of the election has a deeper message about American democracy. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  That there is no relationship between democracy and American elections. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=277.36s)]
*  That with its constantly changing political landscape, it isn't one to be envied. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=280.48s)]
*  The more time passes, the more you see the differences between the US political system and the Russian political system, which in name calls itself a democracy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=285.0s)]
*  Things stay very much the same in Russia. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=293.88000000000005s)]
*  And I think the idea that they're trying to get across here is that you have this kind of vibrant democracy, but it's flawed at its roots. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=295.64000000000004s)]
*  And so that in the end kind of leaves the Russian people no alternative to imagine a Russian political system that could be anything else beyond Vladimir Putin staying in power. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIeEb8kQMc&t=306.56s)]
