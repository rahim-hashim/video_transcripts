Video Description: As Wagner troops relocate to Belarus, NATO allies have expressed concerns about a small strip of land known as the Suwalki Gap on the Poland-Lithuanian border. Belarus has served as a base for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and gaining access to this land in Eastern Europe would link Kaliningrad with Moscow’s ally. But NATO’s additions of Finland and Sweden means that Kaliningrad is effectively encircled by NATO.

WSJ explains why this corridor has been described as a ‘weak spot’ and how it could be vulnerable to Russia.

# This 60-Mile Strip of Land Is NATO’s ‘Weak Spot’ Against Russia | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE)
*  This tiny strip of land in Eastern Europe is being called NATO's Dangerous Spot. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=0.0s)]
*  It's known as the Svartki Gap. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=6.72s)]
*  It forms a border between NATO members Poland and Lithuania, and lies in between two Russian [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=9.6s)]
*  military strongholds. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=15.76s)]
*  Military strategists say this sparsely populated area with hills, forests and small villages [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=18.32s)]
*  will be a prime target if Russia decides to attack NATO territory. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=23.84s)]
*  Poland and Lithuania are worried about this scenario becoming reality as fighters from [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=29.16s)]
*  the Wagner Mercenary Group arrive on their doorstep in Belarus. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=33.84s)]
*  So here's what's at stake if the Svartki Gap comes under attack. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=38.6s)]
*  The Svartki Gap is around 60 miles long and separates Poland to the west and Lithuania [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=44.68s)]
*  to the east. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=50.32s)]
*  To its northwest lies Kaliningrad, a chunk of Russian territory with a number of military [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=51.32s)]
*  bases. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  It's also home to Russia's Baltic naval fleet and its only ports on the Baltic Sea [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=57.96s)]
*  that doesn't freeze up in the winter, but it's not linked to the Russian mainland. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=62.36s)]
*  The most direct route from Kaliningrad to Russia would be through the Svartki Gap via [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=67.88s)]
*  Russia's neighbour and ally Belarus. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=72.56s)]
*  Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko allowed Moscow to use his country as a base [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=75.4s)]
*  to launch the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=80.52s)]
*  Military analysts say Russia could attack from two ends of the Svartki Gap, with soldiers [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=84.68s)]
*  from Kaliningrad and forces advancing through Belarus, which would leave NATO members Lithuania, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=89.48s)]
*  Latvia and Estonia isolated. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=96.12s)]
*  Moscow would also gain more access to the Baltic Sea, a crucial gateway for commercial [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  shipping. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=103.84s)]
*  NATO has few options to defend its Baltic members by land. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=104.84s)]
*  They'll have to send in reinforcements through Poland to Lithuania by crossing the Svartki [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=109.12s)]
*  Gap. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=113.96s)]
*  Only two highways and a train line connect Poland and the Baltic states. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=114.96s)]
*  That means this narrow strip of land could become congested with troops and military [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=119.63999999999999s)]
*  hardware. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=124.28s)]
*  The stakes were raised even higher in recent months. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=125.52s)]
*  First, fighters from the Wagner mercenary group started relocating to Belarus after [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=128.92s)]
*  aborting a mutiny in Russia in June. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=134.24s)]
*  Then, according to Belarusian television, Wagner troops began training Belarusian soldiers [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=137.84s)]
*  just three miles from the Polish border. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=143.84s)]
*  Poland's Prime Minister says the situation is becoming dangerous. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=146.8s)]
*  Warsaw responded by sending up to 10,000 extra troops to guard its border with Belarus. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=162.96s)]
*  Poland and Lithuania have also closed some of their border crossings with their eastern [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=169.04s)]
*  neighbour. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=173.16s)]
*  NATO has tried to strengthen its defences in the region. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=175.2s)]
*  Multinational battle groups with around 1,000 troops have been set up in each of the Baltic [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=181.0s)]
*  states. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  Large-scale drills have taken place in the area close to the Svartki Gap as a way to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  show NATO's readiness. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=192.04s)]
*  The Baltic states and Poland have also ramped up defence spending. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  They have all vowed to spend 3% of their GDP per year on defence, more than NATO's 2% [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=198.68s)]
*  targets. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  The leaders of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia want NATO forces to be stationed in the region [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=206.56s)]
*  permanently. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  In the meantime, NATO's defence capabilities in the area strengthened with two new members [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  – Finland and Sweden. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=218.96s)]
*  This opens up a gateway to reach the Baltics by sea and air, boosting any potential defence [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=221.16000000000003s)]
*  on land. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=226.44s)]
*  Finland and Sweden's militaries also add hundreds of warplanes, tanks and tens of thousands [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=227.88s)]
*  of soldiers to the alliance. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=233.68s)]
*  Analysts say this makes a Russian invasion even more costly. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=237.32s)]
*  Finland and Sweden's integration means Kaliningrad is effectively encircled by NATO. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=241.32s)]
*  Any attack by Russia could leave the exclave vulnerable to isolation and blockade by the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=247.0s)]
*  alliance. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=252.04s)]
*  Scientists believe Russia is unlikely to launch an armed attack on the Svoboda Gap while it [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=254.76s)]
*  has its hands full with Ukraine. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=259.32s)]
*  Polish opposition leader Donald Tusk, who's campaigning to become the next prime minister, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=263.12s)]
*  accused the government of using the Wagner threat to stroke fear ahead of October's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=267.92s)]
*  election. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=273.0s)]
*  But Poland's government denies this. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=274.0s)]
*  Still, NATO's eastern members say Wagner's presence on their doorstep remains a security [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=277.12s)]
*  risk. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=283.64s)]
*  That's why they want to make sure the Svoboda Gap is well defended to deter any potential [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=284.64s)]
*  aggression from Russia. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNlMdbsmXCE&t=289.96s)]
