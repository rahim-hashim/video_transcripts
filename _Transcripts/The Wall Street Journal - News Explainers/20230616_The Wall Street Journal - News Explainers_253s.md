# The Elvis Presley Estate Battle, Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec)
*  Lisa Marie Presley's daughter, actress Riley Keough, is set to become the sole [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=0.0s)]
*  trustee of her late mother's estate. That means Riley will effectively be in [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=4.44s)]
*  charge of her grandfather Elvis Presley's legacy. That decision resolves [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  a legal dispute between Riley and her grandmother Priscilla Presley, six months [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=13.02s)]
*  after Lisa Marie's death at 54. But how did it get to this point? And what does [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=17.18s)]
*  Lisa Marie leave behind? Lisa Marie was the sole remaining heir of Elvis Presley. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=22.36s)]
*  When Elvis died, the estate was valued at only five million dollars, you know, 25 [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=27.56s)]
*  million dollars in today's dollars. His ex-wife Priscilla stepped in to try and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=33.48s)]
*  save the estate. That involved opening Graceland to the public in 1982. So [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=38.68s)]
*  essentially the property became, instead of a drain on the estate with maintenance, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  became a moneymaker for the family. Elvis Presley Enterprises was also set up to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=50.08s)]
*  manage the estate's assets. Lisa Marie took over the estate and Elvis Presley [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=55.22s)]
*  Enterprises in 1993. It's estimated that by the time Lisa Marie turned 25 and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=59.22s)]
*  fully inherited the estate, it was valued at around a hundred million dollars. That [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=66.94s)]
*  turnaround would not last long. In 2005, Lisa Marie sold the majority of Elvis [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=72.34s)]
*  Presley Enterprises but retained ownership of the Graceland mansion. The [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=78.42s)]
*  sale was to help clear 20 million dollars in debt, according to a 2018 [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=83.02s)]
*  lawsuit filed by her former business manager. She accused him of letting the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=87.06s)]
*  estate dwindle away and he in turn countersued, accusing her of living an [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=92.66s)]
*  extravagant lifestyle against all better advice. So we know that money was being [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=100.02s)]
*  spent in big quantities. Details were laid out in court documents filed last [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=107.1s)]
*  November related to her divorce from her fourth husband. They revealed Lisa Marie [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=112.7s)]
*  was spending in excess of $92,000 per month. That included expenses for her [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=118.1s)]
*  young twin daughters. She received around $104,000 per month on average from EPE [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=123.14s)]
*  and took home a monthly salary of $4,361 as an employee of Graceland. She had [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=128.66s)]
*  around $95,000 in the bank and nearly $715,000 in stocks, bonds, and other [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=136.34s)]
*  assets. But she owed $1.8 million in taxes. Overall, the filings indicate [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  Lisa Marie Presley's net worth was negative $3.8 million in the months [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=150.22s)]
*  before her death. Lisa Marie's assets were held in what's called a living [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=154.78s)]
*  revocable trust with her three surviving children as beneficiaries. But here was [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=159.26s)]
*  where things got complicated. In 2010, she named her mother Priscilla and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=164.58s)]
*  former business manager Barry Siegel as co-trustees. Priscilla Presley says she [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=170.3s)]
*  discovered this document purporting to remove Priscilla and Barry and in place [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=176.9s)]
*  appoint Lisa Marie's daughter Riley Keough as a trustee. Priscilla said the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=183.74s)]
*  signatures didn't match, names were misspelled, and various trust rules [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=189.62s)]
*  weren't followed. So Priscilla asked a judge to declare the new document to be [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=193.98000000000002s)]
*  invalid and to keep her position as co-trustee to oversee her daughter's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=197.9s)]
*  assets. In June, Riley Keough asked an L.A. court to approve a settlement that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=201.82s)]
*  will see her become the sole trustee of Lisa Marie's assets. Those include the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=207.1s)]
*  Graceland mansion and the proceeds from a life insurance policy. The settlement [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=211.62s)]
*  also included an undisclosed one-off payment to Priscilla, who will also be [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=216.34s)]
*  paid a monthly fee as a special advisor to the trust. A spokesperson for [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=220.34s)]
*  didn't respond to a request for comment. Immediately after the settlement was [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=225.29999999999998s)]
*  reached in May, Priscilla said she was pleased to resolve the situation. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=229.66s)]
*  Riley's lawyer didn't respond to multiple requests for comment. The legal [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=234.06s)]
*  dispute played out as the Elvis brand expands to new audiences and revenue [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=238.38s)]
*  streams. The king of rock and roll's legacy will endure under a unified front [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=242.22s)]
*  for now. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLJZ31Bwec&t=247.14s)]
