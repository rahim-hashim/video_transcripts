# Inside Elon Musk’s Fascination With ‘X’ | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ)
*  SpaceX, the Tesla Model X, X.A.I. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't know very many people who might say they have a favorite letter, but with Elon Musk, it's very clear. It's X. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=5.12s)]
*  And now, Twitter joins the ranks of the billionaire's other companies as its name switches to X. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  But while the name is new, the URL x.com isn't. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=18.8s)]
*  It's the latest chapter in a story that Musk started more than two decades ago. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  I think x.com could absolutely be a multi-billion dollar bonanza. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  Here's why the previous x.com didn't stick and what its past can tell us about the app's future. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  Oh, X, X. Yeah? You will be the letter of the day. Oh, you bet I will. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  Musk launched the original x.com in 1999 as a banking site after selling his first startup, Zip2. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=46.92s)]
*  X.com, in his conception at that time, was going to be the one stop shop for financial services. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=54.56s)]
*  Jimmy Soni is the author of The Founders, a book about the beginning of PayPal. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=60.64s)]
*  He spent six years interviewing Musk and his colleagues about the early days of the company. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=65.88s)]
*  He thought it was, as he put it to me, quote, the coolest URL on the Internet. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  I thought, well, if we can combine all types of financial services in one, so you have like mortgages, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=75.28s)]
*  basically all your entire financial relationship seamlessly integrated together in one place online, that would be cool. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  According to Soni, Musk thought x.com had advantages. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=88.28s)]
*  It was short, making it easier to type into a browser and helpful for naming different products. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=92.12s)]
*  X as a digit, as a variable, allows you to say, X checking, X PayPal, X loans, X this, X click, X that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  So the idea was that X was a kind of hub and from it would emerge all these other financial spokes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=106.56s)]
*  But this vision for Musk's site didn't pan out. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=111.28s)]
*  In 2000, x.com merged with Confinity, the company that owned PayPal, a peer-to-peer payment product. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  And founders Musk, Max Levchin, Peter Thiel and other executives disagreed on several things. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=121.84s)]
*  One was the name. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=128.72s)]
*  Some of the x.com people believe that X is a touch salacious. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=130.6s)]
*  It's a little confusing. It's even sinister. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=135.32s)]
*  They hear this directly from customers. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=137.84s)]
*  Money was also a problem. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=140.0s)]
*  The company wasn't making a profit yet and was reimbursing customers who had been defrauded online. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=142.0s)]
*  The PayPal folks, the Confinity team, Max and Peter's team are saying to themselves, listen, we don't have a lot of runway. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=148.0s)]
*  Fraud is very, very high. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=155.68s)]
*  The economy is clearly collapsing and we have this successful product called PayPal. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=157.44s)]
*  We should put all our eggs in that basket. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=161.2s)]
*  Musk was eventually forced out of the company and temporarily left behind x.com and his ambitions for the site. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=163.32s)]
*  But he came back to the URL. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=170.32s)]
*  In 2017, Musk repurchased the domain, tweeting that it held sentimental value to him. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=172.88s)]
*  He held on to it and held on to the ideas for 20 plus years and now he is trying to bring them back to life. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=179.44s)]
*  Musk says that the PayPal that emerged in the years after he left the company didn't match the vision he had for x.com. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=184.28s)]
*  If PayPal executed the plan that I wanted to execute on, I think it would probably be the most valuable company in the world. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=191.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=196.6s)]
*  It would be called x, but it would be the most valuable company in the world. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=199.12s)]
*  He told the All In podcast last year, prior to his purchase of Twitter, that he wanted to create an app that emulates WeChat from China. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=201.92s)]
*  If you're in China, it's basically you kind of live on WeChat. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=209.88s)]
*  It does everything. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=212.76s)]
*  It's sort of like Twitter plus PayPal plus a whole bunch of other things. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=214.36s)]
*  And O'Rollins One was actually a great interface and it's really an excellent app. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=217.76s)]
*  Purchasing Twitter opened up another chance. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=222.16s)]
*  But this time, Musk had more to work with. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=224.72s)]
*  When Elon talked about why he was buying Twitter, he saw it as jumpstarting his grander ambitions for x. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=227.12s)]
*  And with that acquisition in late 2022, he was getting a huge user base that had already grown accustomed to coming to Twitter on a daily basis. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=232.67999999999998s)]
*  Musk said in a tweet that the shift to x reflects Twitter's expanded capabilities since he took over the site. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=246.56s)]
*  Saying the name Twitter made more sense when it was just 140 character messages going back and forth. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=253.24s)]
*  But he and Twitter CEO Linda Iaccarino hinted at a future for the site that could look more like Musk's original vision. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=259.24s)]
*  Advances in tech since 1999 could help x succeed where x.com failed. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=266.76s)]
*  I think that when Elon was trying to do x.com in 1999, most people were dialing up to get their Internet web pages loaded super slow. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=273.24s)]
*  There was no mobile app ecosystem. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=281.72s)]
*  There was no iPhone. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  But some of the problems x.com faced in 1999 are still a problem today, like the name. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=286.92s)]
*  It's not clear exactly what the rights are for x as a company going forward, not just in the U.S., but around the world with various jurisdictions. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=294.24s)]
*  And it also it's one of those things, it's not clear what the user is going to think of it as. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=305.48s)]
*  Is this a dirty website or is this going to be the world's greatest financial institution? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  And money is still an issue. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=316.64s)]
*  The site has struggled to win back advertising dollars it lost during Musk's takeover, and it took on billions in debt during the sale. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=319.0s)]
*  Plus, attempts at a super app haven't taken off in the U.S. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=326.68s)]
*  And regulators have voiced concerns about social networks dabbling in finance, like when Metta attempted a crypto payment system in 2019. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=330.56s)]
*  The U.S. has rules in place to protect consumers. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=338.96s)]
*  And there's a lot of hurdles and steps that involved to become a bank or to become a financial institution. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=343.08s)]
*  So that's one of the things that Elon Musk will have to deal with as he kind of expands what x is or what it wants to be. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=349.84s)]
*  X didn't comment. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=358.28s)]
*  But people familiar with how Musk works say not to count him out. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=360.08s)]
*  This is me, curling a 45. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=364.12s)]
*  While there are lots of really smart people out there who say being able to replicate a super app here in the U.S. is impossible or really hard to do, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=369.08s)]
*  you kind of get the idea that he's looking to prove them wrong, that he's going to be very excited to show what he can do. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=378.32s)]
*  Now, if he's successful, that's still the question. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt5gAciBEWQ&t=384.56s)]
