*  It's Kim's first trip abroad since North Korea gradually reopened its borders this summer after the COVID-19 pandemic. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=7.76s)]
*  US officials said the talks could advance ammunition sales between the two countries, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=15.24s)]
*  as Moscow locks to replenish a weapons stockpile depleted by the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=19.52s)]
*  This meeting is a win-win situation for Russia and North Korea. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=24.0s)]
*  Here's what Kim and Putin stand to gain from these talks. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=29.72s)]
*  Kim crossed into Russia on Tuesday after a two-day journey aboard his personal bulletproof train. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  It is very rare for the North Korean leader to travel abroad. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  He does not take many flights, usually takes trains when he is travelling. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=44.16s)]
*  As the pandemic ended and Kim began restoring connections with the outside world, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=51.8s)]
*  he also made a series of prominent visits inside North Korea to military facilities, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  urging the population to prepare for war. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=61.36s)]
*  Experts say he's using these appearances to mask the country's struggling economy and severe food shortages, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=66.24s)]
*  after the country was sealed off for four years. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=72.24s)]
*  Russia is one of the countries that could provide North Korea with aid, especially as it is under Western sanctions. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=75.12s)]
*  In August, after the leaders of the US, South Korea and Japan agreed to hold joint military drills, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=83.36s)]
*  Kim Jong-un called the three leaders gang bosses. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=89.36s)]
*  We meet in this historic place to make a historic moment. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=93.36s)]
*  Kim meeting with Putin is significant because it shows that North Korea has powerful allies, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=98.36s)]
*  especially during a time when the US is strengthening military cooperation with Japan and South Korea, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=106.36s)]
*  deploying strategic assets on the Korean peninsula. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=112.36s)]
*  US, Korea, we love together! [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=116.36s)]
*  Having allies like Russia is going to help Kim explain to his people that we have countries on our side that will help us. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=120.36s)]
*  High-level visits between Russia and North Korea restarted in July. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=131.36s)]
*  US officials said Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu's visit was aimed at convincing Pyongyang to sell ammunition to Moscow. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=137.36s)]
*  Russia is facing weapon shortages in Ukraine and wants to replenish its stockpile. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=145.36s)]
*  Much of North Korea's weapons are based on Soviet-era technology, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=153.36s)]
*  which means they can easily be incorporated into Russia's existing systems. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=157.36s)]
*  But experts say what Pyongyang could provide Moscow is limited. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=161.36s)]
*  Most of North Korea's stockpiles are very old. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=165.36s)]
*  Modern weaponry that North Korea has manufactured in recent years that are more advanced, they can't be mass-produced yet. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=169.36s)]
*  Any arms deal between Pyongyang and Moscow would violate United Nations Security Council resolutions. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=178.36s)]
*  The latest meeting between Kim and Putin shows Russia and North Korea have continued to grow closer over the years, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=184.36s)]
*  as both leaders vowed to strengthen cooperation on all fronts. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=191.36s)]
*  But the key factor bringing them together is a common enemy, the US. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=195.36s)]
*  North Korea and Russia have both been consistent in saying we don't want a global order that the US wants. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=199.36s)]
*  This alliance sort of helps Russia and North Korea build sort of a counter-effort against the US [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=208.36s)]
*  to say that we have allies, we have neighbors, just as much as the US has a military presence in the region. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu78d0Rzbnc&t=216.36s)]
