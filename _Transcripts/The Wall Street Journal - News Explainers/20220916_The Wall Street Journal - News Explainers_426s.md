# How Experts Find Monkeypox, Polio in Sewage | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac)
*  This is sewage from 1.4 million residents in the Bay Area. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=0.0s)]
*  It might seem like just waste, but it's a goldmine for researchers. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=5.48s)]
*  I am a scientist and I'm supposed to be skeptical and I continue to be amazed that what we measure [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=9.64s)]
*  in wastewater seems to be so helpful. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=15.92s)]
*  Sewage has become a valuable tool that can help officials tackle outbreaks like COVID-19, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=20.56s)]
*  monkeypox and even polio, before people show up at testing centers and hospitals. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=25.76s)]
*  After officials found polio virus in New York's sewage, it became a state emergency. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=31.28s)]
*  Like the wastewater epidemiologist like to say, you know, everybody uses the toilet. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=36.24s)]
*  So how exactly do researchers find viruses in our waste? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=41.44s)]
*  And what can sewage tell us about public health? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Before researchers can find pathogens in the sewage, you have to flush it down. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=49.64s)]
*  Sewage from over a million Bay Area residents ends up here, at the San Jose-Santa Clara [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=54.56s)]
*  Regional Wastewater Facility. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  This is everything that comes down the drain. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  When you take a shower, brush your teeth, use the toilet, all of your excretions go [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=64.64s)]
*  into wastewater and end up at a wastewater treatment plant. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=71.4s)]
*  In 2020, researchers started the Sewer Coronavirus Alert Network, also known as SCAN, at Stanford [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  University. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  The San Jose facility works with SCAN. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=82.32s)]
*  12 times a day, workers here collect samples of raw sewage. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=84.52s)]
*  They sample the wastewater after the solids have settled out of it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=89.36s)]
*  That's now what's called sludge. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=92.64s)]
*  The measurement is 250 milliliters. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=94.44s)]
*  The combined sample is stored in this mini-fridge until it's full and collected once a day. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=98.8s)]
*  Then it's sent to Verily, a health research company in South San Francisco that partners [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=105.16s)]
*  Here, researchers process samples for more than 60 plants. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  On a busy day, they can test close to 70 samples. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  After they arrive, the liquid needs to be separated from the solid waste. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=120.48s)]
*  The samples are dropped into the centrifuge and spun at tens of thousands of revolutions per minute. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  The solids have about 100 times more viral particles on a per-mass basis than the liquid, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=130.0s)]
*  So we want to be able to detect things that are at very low concentrations or very rare [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=135.44s)]
*  in the sewer shed or in the waste. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=139.68s)]
*  And so the solid gives us the best opportunity to do that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=141.4s)]
*  After the solid settles at the bottom of the tube, the liquid is pulled out with a pipette. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=146.28s)]
*  The lab only needs 0.5 grams to test for viruses like COVID-19. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=150.88s)]
*  The rest of the sample is saved in a negative 79 degree Celsius freezer. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=155.36s)]
*  We want to archive that and save it if we ever need to go back to test it for any new [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=159.92s)]
*  virus that might have been circulating there during that time or something we didn't know about. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  What happens is that the lab staff take that solid and they, as they affectionately term it, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=169.2s)]
*  roll it into a poopsicle so that it can fit in a much smaller tube than that large tube. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  To test for viruses, the viral particles need to be pushed into a liquid preservative by force. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=180.64s)]
*  After another round in the centrifuge, the viral DNA and RNA are ready to be isolated. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=187.76s)]
*  Verily uses machines like these to transfer samples and isolate genetic material to make [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=193.6s)]
*  the process more efficient. Finally, the samples are ready to be tested. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=198.48s)]
*  Verily uses PCR to figure out just how much viral DNA and RNA is in the sample. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=203.12s)]
*  PCR is a test used to detect genetic material. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=208.56s)]
*  The lab can test for up to three viruses at a time using one plate. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=212.16s)]
*  Each plate has 96 wells for samples. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=216.16s)]
*  If the PCR detects a specific virus, it makes millions of copies of the genetic material [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=219.2s)]
*  and tags them a fluorescent color. That information is plotted on this graph, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=224.4s)]
*  where researchers can see just how much of each virus was in the sample that day. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=228.72s)]
*  So these are ones, these gray ones here, these are ones that had no virus, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=232.8s)]
*  no viral RNA or DNA in that particular well. These are ones that had monkeypox, SARS-CoV-2, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=236.72s)]
*  and human metanumavirus. So just looking at this, you can see there's more SARS-CoV-2 than there is [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=244.0s)]
*  monkeypox, and there's probably a little bit more human metanumavirus than there is monkeypox. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=250.48s)]
*  The whole testing process takes eight hours. That's longer than it takes to test a COVID swab sample. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=255.27999999999997s)]
*  But sewage is a lot more complicated. Researchers still consider wastewater to be what's called [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  a leading indicator. People can shed the virus into wastewater before they even show symptoms, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=265.84s)]
*  and know to get tested. This past winter in Boston specifically, you saw the wastewater level [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=271.36s)]
*  spike before we really saw the Omicron variant tick off. And so that sometimes gives public [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  health officials and hospitals a heads up saying, okay, something might be coming here, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=283.68s)]
*  we should probably prepare. And researchers say it's efficient. One wastewater sample from [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=288.48s)]
*  the San Jose facility covers over a million people. Not everybody has a primary care provider [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  or when they feel sick has the ability or even wants to go out and get tested. It is a really [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=301.44s)]
*  sort of unbiased, broad way of sort of collecting community samples, which is helpful for public [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=308.64s)]
*  health. Now officials across the country monitor wastewater for COVID. Since the pandemic started, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=315.35999999999996s)]
*  there has been a huge surge in interest in using wastewater to monitor community health. But it's [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=321.2s)]
*  not a perfect tracking system. Sewage can't pinpoint who exactly is sick. And it can't provide [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=327.52s)]
*  a total case count either. Instead, it provides information on the level of virus in the community [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=333.28s)]
*  and how it changes over time. The idea of testing wastewater isn't new. It's a pretty old technology, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=338.24s)]
*  actually. It's decades old and primarily it was used to sort of monitor for polio. And in New York, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=344.32s)]
*  that old technology helped alert officials to the recent spread of polio virus throughout the state. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=350.96s)]
*  Governor Kathy Hochul declared polio a state disaster in September. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=355.84s)]
*  Scan and Verily are also testing for diseases like monkeypox and influenza A. Once you have that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  infrastructure in place, there's an economy of scale. Like you can easily swap in and swap out [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=366.4s)]
*  assays like we were able to do with monkeypox. Tracking diseases isn't the only thing wastewater [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=372.55999999999995s)]
*  surveillance can be used for. Cities like Cary, North Carolina and Tempe, Arizona had been tracking [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  opioid usage through wastewater even before the pandemic. And epidemiologists are exploring how [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=383.76s)]
*  hospitals can use their own wastewater to test for antibiotic resistant bacteria. But BAME hopes [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=389.12s)]
*  wastewater surveillance could be useful beyond labs and public health officials. A dream could [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=394.24s)]
*  be that we know it's like a weather report. Like you know in your community what is circulating. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=399.76s)]
*  We do have this vision for all the uses of wastewater and it includes things like pandemic [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=405.92s)]
*  response, staffing at hospitals and clinics, choice of pharmaceuticals or non-pharmaceutical [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=410.8s)]
*  interventions and even vaccine development. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYm1e7D9Ac&t=416.88s)]
