# Inside the Fed’s Plan to Support Minority Workers  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 18, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE)
*  Well, I think what our new framework is going to do is it's going to make it more likely [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=0.0s)]
*  that people at the margins of society can participate in our labor market. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=18.88s)]
*  We're not going to preemptively start raising interest rates when we see unemployment getting [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=24.2s)]
*  extremely low unless we see signs of inflation. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=29.68s)]
*  I think what that will do is mean that the economy will have some extended stimulus and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=33.24s)]
*  that will allow more people to get jobs for a much longer period of time. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=39.6s)]
*  By the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Reserve has two mandates. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=48.16s)]
*  One is stable prices to make sure that the price level does not fluctuate too wildly [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=51.64s)]
*  and the other is maximum employment to try to make sure that the economy is operating [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=56.68s)]
*  as robustly and as large as possible. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=60.84s)]
*  We work to try to manage that through an interest rate policy as well as other tools that we [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=63.84s)]
*  have at our disposal. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=71.0s)]
*  The Phillips curve is a relationship between employment and the level of prices. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=77.5s)]
*  What the Phillips curve says is that as we get employment and labor markets that are [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=82.76s)]
*  tighter and tighter, inflation will get more and more intense. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=87.2s)]
*  As you get closer and closer to full employment levels, you should see, according to the curve, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=91.92s)]
*  spikes in inflation that could move the economy into a much less stable position when it comes [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=96.08s)]
*  to the price level. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=101.88s)]
*  What the Phillips curve tells us about employment is that as levels of employment go up, as [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=103.56s)]
*  you get to labor markets that are tighter and tighter, that's going to put pressure [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=108.88s)]
*  on wages. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=113.44s)]
*  Firms are going to have to compete more to get workers and that will translate into higher [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=115.12s)]
*  prices for final goods. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=119.24s)]
*  High inflation in the 1970s was really detrimental to the economy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  The tyranny of double-digit inflation is our common enemy in 1974. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=126.96s)]
*  The experience in the 70s certainly was a marker and it allowed the Fed to really reflect [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=135.04s)]
*  and come to a conclusion that they didn't want to have that ever happen again. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=142.54s)]
*  There is a propensity and has been a propensity to proactively prevent inflation from spiking [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=147.38s)]
*  to very high levels. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=153.84s)]
*  When people say the Phillips curve is flattened, what they mean is that we're not seeing the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=161.68s)]
*  same type of response in the price level to very high levels of employment that we used [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=167.28s)]
*  to. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=172.88s)]
*  That sensitivity to tight labor markets is not triggering inflation in the marketplace. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  To that extent, what it means is that if you drew that curve out, it would show a much [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=181.0s)]
*  flatter relationship. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  What we see in terms of our general employment levels and many of the national statistics [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=190.84s)]
*  are really averages of a number of different relationships. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=206.68s)]
*  We actually try to dive more deeply into that and see how different segments of the economy [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=210.52s)]
*  are performing and how workers from different experiences and backgrounds are experiencing [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=216.68s)]
*  the economy. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  The data has been pretty clear on this for quite some time that the employment for minorities [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=223.8s)]
*  has lagged that for the general population. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  If you look at unemployment rates, I think the basic rule has been that unemployment [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=231.8s)]
*  rates for African Americans has been about twice that for the general population. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, the natural rate of unemployment is basically the level of employment that you [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=246.68s)]
*  would see if everyone who wanted a job could have one and it was not going to trigger inflation. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  My estimate of the natural rate of unemployment has really changed over my entire career. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=265.04s)]
*  When I started in my role here, the estimate was more in the four and a half percent range. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=269.92s)]
*  I've really perceived that the natural rate has fallen even further, somewhere south of [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=275.68s)]
*  4 percent, maybe in the 3.7 to 3.8 percent level. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=281.68s)]
*  That's really informed how I've thought about what appropriate policy should look like. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=285.6s)]
*  Well, I think we've learned a lot over the last seven or eight years since the great [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=290.6s)]
*  financial crisis. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=298.2s)]
*  All of the signals that we've learned have suggested that we can be a bit more patient [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=300.08s)]
*  in increasing rates and responding to very tight labor markets. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=305.44s)]
*  I think moving forward, what we will expect and what I expect we'll see from the committee [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=309.88s)]
*  is a willingness to keep rates lower for longer and really wait for signs of inflation before [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=314.4s)]
*  moving to a more proactive policy approach. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=322.12s)]
*  The higher inflation is a challenge for people that have constrained incomes and constrained [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=331.08s)]
*  wealth. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=336.64s)]
*  This is one of the reasons why as we think about what appropriate policy is, we keep [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  those people in mind and make sure that we're doing all we can to understand the challenges [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=342.76s)]
*  that they face. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=347.68s)]
*  One thing I would say is that if we're going to have an economy that works for all people, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=349.2s)]
*  monetary policy is just going to be one tool for that. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=353.84s)]
*  We're going to need investments on the fiscal side as well as in state and local governments [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=356.8s)]
*  to make sure that there's an infrastructure so that people can get the skills that allow [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=362.56s)]
*  them to have higher wages so they can manage and prosper in an economy that's growing robustly. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vASF-4elpCE&t=368.04s)]
