# Why Black Workers Face a Slower Economic Recovery  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ)
*  After two months of unprecedented increases, the U.S. unemployment rate took a surprising turn in May. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=0.0s)]
*  It went down. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=6.5s)]
*  This dip was a hopeful sign that the economy might be bouncing back from coronavirus lockdowns. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=8.0s)]
*  But that dip wasn't universal. Black unemployment ticked upwards. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=13.5s)]
*  It declined in June, but not at the same rate as unemployment overall. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=18.0s)]
*  This follows a decade where the unemployment gap between white and black workers has been narrowing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=23.5s)]
*  But the recent unemployment figures reveal the financial fragility that has persisted for many black workers since the last recession. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=29.5s)]
*  Fragility that has left them poised for a difficult recovery this time around. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=36.5s)]
*  Historically, recessions or periods of high unemployment have been worse for black Americans. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=44.0s)]
*  If you look back 50 years, you can see that this isn't the first time black workers have faced these levels of joblessness. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=49.0s)]
*  Double-digit unemployment is actually nothing sort of unfamiliar for African Americans. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=56.5s)]
*  So while everyone was kind of shocked about how high unemployment spiked when the pandemic hit for African Americans, this is nothing new, actually. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=61.0s)]
*  When it came to the 2008 financial crisis, all racial groups saw their wealth devastated. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=69.0s)]
*  But wealth for black households was much slower to recover. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=74.0s)]
*  A few factors contributed to this difference. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=78.0s)]
*  Among them was that black workers were more likely to have temporary jobs during the recovery. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=80.5s)]
*  This occurred for a couple of reasons. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=85.5s)]
*  So for instance, African Americans are overrepresented in the criminal justice system. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=87.5s)]
*  And we know that having a criminal background, for instance, can be an impediment to employment. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=92.5s)]
*  We also know that African Americans are more likely to be represented in temporary jobs and service sector jobs. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=97.5s)]
*  The kind of jobs that can have sort of less stability, more turnover. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=104.0s)]
*  Government data shows that in 2018, white workers had on average 17 months more tenure at their jobs than black workers. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=108.0s)]
*  Also, the differences for black and white workers in median household income and wages have largely remained unchanged for decades. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=116.0s)]
*  So some of the economists that I've been speaking to as I've been reporting on black unemployment point out that although African Americans were making gains in the labor market, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=124.0s)]
*  as the expansion continued, that really sort of masked some of the lingering inequalities that African Americans are dealing with in terms of wealth. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=133.0s)]
*  And wealth is what we typically think of as providing a cushion to people when there is an economic downturn. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=143.0s)]
*  In 2016, the median black household had less than $18,000 in net worth, compared with $171,000 for white households. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=150.0s)]
*  And in the fourth quarter of 2019, black home ownership was down four percentage points from 2007, while white homeownership had almost regained its pre-recession level. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=160.0s)]
*  But as the economic expansion continued, there were signs that black workers were finally beginning to benefit. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=172.0s)]
*  And in 2018, wages for black workers began to increase. And by February 2020, the black unemployment rate was near record lows. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=178.0s)]
*  Then the coronavirus pandemic hit. By April, black unemployment had surged to 16.7 percent compared to 14.7 percent overall. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=187.0s)]
*  For black workers who kept their jobs, many were in industries that put them at risk. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=197.0s)]
*  These employees made up a higher percentage of frontline workers in industries like public transit and health care than their share of workers overall. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=202.0s)]
*  So economists and other experts have really been pointing out that it has been a one-two punch for the African-American community. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=211.0s)]
*  First on the health front because African-Americans have suffered a disproportionate number of deaths from COVID-19. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=217.0s)]
*  And so some economists are kind of sounding the alarm that the recovery could not be even and could actually lag for African-Americans. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=223.0s)]
*  But economists say the $2 trillion stimulus package and paycheck protection program may be helpful in lowering black unemployment. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=232.0s)]
*  Although maybe not to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=239.0s)]
*  There are some concerns, though, that some of the aid may not be reaching African-American communities. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=242.0s)]
*  So, for instance, when the paycheck protection program first rolled out, a lot of African-American small businesses were reporting not being able to access it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=248.0s)]
*  And protests over the killing of George Floyd might lead to more ideas and movement on solving some longstanding disparities. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=256.0s)]
*  A lot of the workers and business owners that we talked to also said perhaps now is a time to really have conversations about policies that will address these longstanding inequalities in wealth and health that African-Americans have experienced and that this coronavirus pandemic really exposed once again. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=264.0s)]
*  The economic disparities felt by black workers are longstanding and interconnected. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=284.0s)]
*  And as the last recovery showed, we take a long time to show signs of improvement. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oqefnQJCQ&t=289.0s)]
