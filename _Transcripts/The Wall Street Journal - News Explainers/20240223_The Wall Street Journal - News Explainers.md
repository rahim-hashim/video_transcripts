# How Alexei Navalny’s Widow, Yulia Navalnaya, Is Challenging Putin  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo)
*  I will continue Alexei Navalny's case. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=0.0s)]
*  Alexei Navalny's widow, Julia Navalny, is emerging as a new political force [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=4.0s)]
*  after she promised to carry on her husband's struggle for a free Russia. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=9.0s)]
*  The most vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin died in an Arctic penal colony in mid-February. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=14.0s)]
*  He had been serving sentences amounting to more than 30 years on various charges. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=20.0s)]
*  Behind bars he still had an incredible symbolic presence. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=26.0s)]
*  His death now really shows a hole that has emerged now in the Russian opposition. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=30.0s)]
*  So will Navalny be able to rally Russians disheartened by her husband's death? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=35.0s)]
*  For years Navalny was in constant presence by her husband's side during political protests and court hearings. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=43.0s)]
*  She was maybe not taking centre stage with Navalny, but she made herself seen [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=50.0s)]
*  and that was extremely important. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=55.0s)]
*  When Navalny was poisoned with a nerve agent in 2020, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=57.0s)]
*  it was his wife who pushed for clearance to fly him to Germany for life-saving treatments. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=61.0s)]
*  When he returned to Russia months later, she was with him until the moment police detained Navalny at the airport. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=70.0s)]
*  Now, with her husband dead and millions of Russians grieving across the country, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=77.0s)]
*  Yulia Navalny is calling on them to stand with her against President Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=82.0s)]
*  She doesn't have a base of her own and I don't think she has quite a message of her own either right now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=103.0s)]
*  Her husband was very well known internationally. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=108.0s)]
*  I think the very force of his character will continue with her, perhaps more easily than in other cases. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=111.0s)]
*  But ultimately she will be playing a role of trying to gather European and potentially American support as well [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=117.0s)]
*  for further action against Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=125.0s)]
*  The role Navalny could play inside Russia is less clear as most of the country's opposition figures [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=129.0s)]
*  are either dead, in prison or scattered abroad in exile. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=135.0s)]
*  She herself is set to continue her husband's work from abroad, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=139.0s)]
*  but reaching out to people inside Russia will be tough as dissent has been brutally crushed in recent years. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=143.0s)]
*  Even bringing flowers to honour Navalny can lead to detention. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=151.0s)]
*  It was scary to go there because there are a lot of videos online that detain people, even sirens. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=155.0s)]
*  It's difficult to get that message into Russia. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=185.0s)]
*  Almost a week after Alexei Navalny's death, his mother finally saw her son's body. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=188.0s)]
*  But she says officials refuse to release his body unless she agrees to a secret funeral. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=203.0s)]
*  The Kremlin has always been afraid of him being a martyr in one way or another [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=209.0s)]
*  and being a rallying point in death or in illness or in whatever of the opposition. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=213.0s)]
*  The Kremlin dismissed allegations by Navalny that Putin killed her husband [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=219.0s)]
*  and said it wasn't following the situation with Navalny's body. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=223.0s)]
*  Right now there's a very understandable backlash against Russia because of Navalny's death, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=227.0s)]
*  increased sanctions, condemnations. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=234.0s)]
*  I think more importantly going forward is how we're going to see her develop and implement a strategy [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=237.0s)]
*  and what that strategy is going to look like. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDnmkLQPo&t=243.0s)]
