# How a Walmart-TikTok Deal Could Transform Online Shopping in U.S. | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 10, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg)
*  TikTok and Walmart may seem like an unlikely match. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=0.0s)]
*  But right now, Walmart is one of the U.S. companies vying to buy a portion of TikTok, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=3.52s)]
*  which has dance videos. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=8.64s)]
*  Walmart has deals for customers. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=11.84s)]
*  The potential TikTok-Walmart deal would satisfy the Trump administration's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=16.16s)]
*  new requirement that TikTok be owned by Americans. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=19.76s)]
*  The sometimes-viral short-form video-sharing app is currently owned by China's ByteDance. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=23.28s)]
*  It was really something to me that was not on my bingo card for this year for Walmart, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=29.28s)]
*  which makes it really interesting. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  It shows yet another way that they are trying to become more relevant to shoppers today than Amazon. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=34.8s)]
*  There's a Walmart within 10 miles of 90% of Americans. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=44.08s)]
*  Billions of people shop at Walmart globally, and it's the country's largest employer. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=47.92s)]
*  But online, Walmart can't keep up with Amazon's digital presence. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=52.88s)]
*  This last quarter, Amazon posted a record $96.2 billion in sales. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=57.92s)]
*  That's why you see Walmart just scrambling to grow online and grow confidence in terms of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=64.08s)]
*  getting people things fast or offering a way to buy online and pick up in a store parking lot. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=70.56s)]
*  They keep trying to figure out their way to do something that even Amazon can't do. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=75.76s)]
*  Enter TikTok. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=82.48s)]
*  If all goes well, the deal could mean that users might eventually be able to buy items [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=83.76s)]
*  fulfilled by Walmart in TikTok videos. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  Imagine being able to buy this brush without leaving the app or even pausing the video. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  Could this acquisition finally give Walmart an edge over Amazon? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=99.12s)]
*  And how might this deal transform online shopping as we know it? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=103.68s)]
*  TikTok and Walmart are not the only companies to see marketing potential in user-created videos. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  Instagram just integrated shoppable features into IGTV. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  And this kind of recommendation-based video shopping is already wildly popular [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=118.56s)]
*  on apps like Douyin in China. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=123.04s)]
*  Douyin has recently announced they've got 600 million daily active users, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  which means most internet users in China open Douyin every day. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=130.72s)]
*  Matthew Brennan analyzes the Chinese mobile internet sector. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=137.52s)]
*  And Douyin is ByteDance's Chinese version of TikTok. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=141.2s)]
*  It already has some of the video commerce features that [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=144.72s)]
*  Walmart could try to imitate with TikTok in America. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=147.28s)]
*  They see the video and then they can just tap to buy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=150.48s)]
*  That's one form. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=153.04s)]
*  And the other form is live stream e-commerce where people will, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=154.56s)]
*  rather than watch short videos, they'll watch live stream. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=158.0s)]
*  In the U.S., Amazon launched Amazon Live a few months ago. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  We've linked it for you so you can definitely check it out. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  It gives influencers a streaming video platform to convince consumers [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=168.16s)]
*  to buy their products in real time. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm grabbing those deals, so you gotta grab those too. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=174.24s)]
*  American brands like Tommy Hilfiger are also experimenting with shoppable live streams. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=177.28s)]
*  Always need a statement puffer, aren't I? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=182.96s)]
*  But it's still very early days for any form of video commerce in the U.S. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=184.56s)]
*  And we want you to get involved. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=189.04s)]
*  Developing these new features in a way that aligns with current shoppers' [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=190.8s)]
*  expectations and behaviors can be a challenge. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=194.32s)]
*  Walmart buying TikToks is definitely something that is really different [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=198.16s)]
*  and could leapfrog what Amazon is currently doing in some ways. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=201.68s)]
*  But of course, they have to do it and they have to do it in a way that consumers like [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=207.12s)]
*  and is seamless and they have to build the technology on the back end. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=210.72s)]
*  And those are all hard things to do. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=213.76s)]
*  And even technical and logistical hurdles aside, some experts warn that a successful [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  marketing strategy in one market doesn't always translate to success in another. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=221.28s)]
*  I think a lot of people assume that the model for commerce in China could be described as [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=226.48s)]
*  the future of commerce and could be taken as a better, more modern approach to shopping. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  I think it's just a different approach to shopping and transplanting it into Europe [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=238.0s)]
*  as well as into the U.S. is not as straightforward as most would assume. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  Joe Kazoukiannis collects and analyzes leading commerce marketplace data. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=247.83999999999997s)]
*  He says that buying items influencers are recommending in videos that you're [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  watching for entertainment is a more passive shopping experience than actively searching on [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=256.08s)]
*  Etsy or Amazon for something you've already decided you want to own before logging in. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=260.8s)]
*  This assumption that video shopping is the future is being based purely on the fact that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=266.0s)]
*  it looks more exciting, looks more modern. It looks like it's taking on the sort of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=272.0s)]
*  features modern phones as well as websites allow. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=276.96s)]
*  But that assumption doesn't hold much ground because the shopping we have in the West is [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=279.52s)]
*  search-based and changing that drastically is going to take a very, very long time. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  Facebook and Amazon declined to comment and Walmart didn't respond to requests for comment. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  It remains to be seen whether U.S. consumers are ready to buy a lot of products through a social [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=297.52s)]
*  media app, but the social media companies, the retailers, the brands, they're betting that we [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  already discover a lot of products that way through ads and influencers and things like that and that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=307.68s)]
*  we're going to be ready to buy if we aren't already. And for good reason. There are over [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=312.32s)]
*  100 million monthly American users on TikTok and over 100 million American households shop at [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  Walmart at least once a year. But experts say what makes each popular in their own spaces is no [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=324.08s)]
*  guarantee a partnership would create a video commerce experience enticing enough to change [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  how Americans already shop. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-7HUBQkDg&t=335.68s)]
