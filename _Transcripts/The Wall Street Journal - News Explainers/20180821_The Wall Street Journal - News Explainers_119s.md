# How We Got to the Longest Bull Run in History
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 21, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds)
*  Wall Street is celebrating the longest bull market ever. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=0.0s)]
*  That means it's the longest period ever without a decline of 20 percent or more. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=3.04s)]
*  Now it's kind of amazing because we have a trade war going on right now, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=7.76s)]
*  we have an implosion in Turkey, and we have volatility all over the place. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=11.76s)]
*  The last longest bull market occurred in the 1990s and it ended with the tech bubble bursting. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Now what does today's long bull run mean for the current markets? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=22.32s)]
*  I'm Ken Brown. I'm the editor of Heard on the Street at the Wall Street Journal and we're going [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  to go back over some of the high points and low points of this 3543-day bull market. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=30.160000000000004s)]
*  Since the bull market started on March 9, 2009, stocks are up 320 percent. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=38.0s)]
*  And if you go back to the start date, you can see why. Bull markets start during terrible times, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=43.52s)]
*  and this is no exception. It was the heart of the financial crisis. Unemployment was right at its [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=48.72s)]
*  highest level of the financial crisis. The other thing that helped drive up stocks was the Federal [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=54.24s)]
*  Reserve, which was basically printing money to get the economy moving. That had the effect of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=59.2s)]
*  boosting asset prices like those of stocks and real estate. The road to the record has not been [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=64.48s)]
*  smooth. In fact, two years after the bull market started, it almost ended abruptly after credit [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=69.28s)]
*  agencies reduced the U.S. government's credit rating. We had two of the worst stock market days [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=74.56s)]
*  ever because of that. There was another ugly stretch in 2015 and 2016 caused by China devaluing [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=80.24s)]
*  its currency. That sent ripples through markets all over the world. With the election of Donald [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=86.8s)]
*  Trump in November 2016, the bull market gained new steam. A big corporate tax cut boosted profits [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=91.6s)]
*  and a big stimulus got consumers spending more. How will it end? Bull markets start during terrible [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=98.24s)]
*  times, but they end during periods of euphoria. The last two bull markets ended when the tech stock [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=104.56s)]
*  bubble burst and the housing market burst. So investors right now should be suspicious. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=109.76s)]
*  Bubble bursting? Blah, blah, blah. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHTVkue17Ds&t=115.28s)]
