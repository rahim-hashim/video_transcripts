# The Secret to Why a Tesla Costs So Much
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 19, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo)
*  Take a look at any Tesla Model 3 and try to guess what's the most expensive part to manufacture. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=0.0s)]
*  Go ahead, we'll wait. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=7.36s)]
*  It's okay if it's not obvious, because you can't see it without tearing a Tesla apart. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=10.86s)]
*  Investment bankers UBS ran an analysis of such a teardown and found that the battery [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=17.44s)]
*  makes up to 40% of the manufacturing costs of any Model 3. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=21.94s)]
*  The battery has been one of Tesla's greatest challenges in their goal to make a vehicle [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=27.26s)]
*  that's affordable to most people, yet still profitable. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=31.900000000000002s)]
*  The ticket price for a Model 3 is currently about $42,900, while the average new car in [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=36.06s)]
*  America is selling at around $32,000. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=41.540000000000006s)]
*  In February, Mr. Musk tweeted that the Model 3 is down to just below $35,000, but only [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  if you include $8,000 in gas savings and a tax credit that's set to expire on July 1st. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=51.98s)]
*  The $42,900 ticket still puts the Model 3 outside of reach for most consumers. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=58.62s)]
*  So we're going to take a look at what makes the batteries in Teslas so expensive. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=65.06s)]
*  I see a Tesla, I don't see a car. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=70.62s)]
*  I see a battery pack driving around disguised as a car. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=72.69999999999999s)]
*  Jay Whitaker of Carnegie Mellon University studies the battery cells produced by Panasonic, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=76.82s)]
*  Tesla's supplier. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=81.9s)]
*  Certainly the first or second most expensive thing in any of these vehicles is the battery [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=83.86s)]
*  pack. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=87.7s)]
*  And so they are acutely interested in shaving off every penny they can from the cost of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=88.7s)]
*  that pack, because obviously the vehicle market is very competitive and they are competing [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=92.58000000000001s)]
*  with internal combustion engine cars. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=97.42s)]
*  He says the amount of charge a battery holds can make a big difference in the battery's cost. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=100.58000000000001s)]
*  The lower end of the Model 3 can hold 50 kilowatt hours of charge. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  That's good for 220 miles of driving. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=110.66s)]
*  Doing that takes 2,976 of these. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=113.94s)]
*  The Panasonic 2170. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=118.22s)]
*  Good reason to believe that Tesla's kind of found that sweet spot with this particular [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=120.5s)]
*  flavor, this particular variation, because I think they're one of the early adopters [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=123.94s)]
*  and maybe the only adopter of this particular size. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=128.3s)]
*  It remains the most energy-dense battery suitable for electric vehicles. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=131.66s)]
*  Its namesake 2170 stands for the diameter and height of the battery, which is bigger [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=136.38s)]
*  and bulkier than the predecessor found in the Model S. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=141.38s)]
*  The main thing you want to do if you want to optimize the cost of a lithium-ion battery [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=145.85999999999999s)]
*  cell is you want to have the thickest electrodes you can have in any of them. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=149.7s)]
*  So you're making fewer cells with more energy, this definitely is going to play out to a [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=153.7s)]
*  better cost proposition at the end of the day. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=158.62s)]
*  The nuance in materials matters. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=161.57999999999998s)]
*  Tesla's batteries rely on a mixture of lithium, nickel, cobalt, aluminum, and oxide. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=164.18s)]
*  The biggest thing driving the cost was the cobalt. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=170.1s)]
*  So Tesla and Panasonic reduced their reliance on the element. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=173.02s)]
*  Their new battery uses more silicon instead. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=176.74s)]
*  Analyst Sandy Munroe, who tore down Model 3s, touted its battery management system, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=180.1s)]
*  saying that Tesla is far ahead of the competition, which shows in this chart. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=184.38s)]
*  Over the last decade, batteries were projected to come in at pretty expensive rates, as much [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=189.14000000000001s)]
*  as $1,500 per kilowatt hour. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=193.7s)]
*  In a vehicle with a similar range to the Model 3, that could translate to a $75,000 battery. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=195.73999999999998s)]
*  When contacted, Tesla wouldn't share details on its cost for the Model 3 batteries, but [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=202.61999999999998s)]
*  it's clear that the company has consistently entered markets well under projected rates. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=207.38s)]
*  The red dots on this chart represent their entries on the EV market. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=212.29999999999998s)]
*  And a UBS estimate on Tesla's Model 3 batteries comes at $111 per kilowatt hour. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=216.22s)]
*  That's 20% cheaper than the nearest competitor. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=222.9s)]
*  But so far, it hasn't been enough to hit the $35,000 mark without tax credits. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=226.06s)]
*  So the company has looked for other ways to optimize battery costs, like scaling production. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=231.32s)]
*  In 2015, the automaker announced a joint venture, Gigafactory, with Panasonic. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=236.9s)]
*  Tesla's website shows that the factory is producing up to 20 gigawatt hours of new capacity [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=244.02s)]
*  each year. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=248.14000000000001s)]
*  That includes production for other products, but there's plenty of battery storage for [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=249.5s)]
*  cars happening there. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=252.98s)]
*  Whitaker says that many batteries per year maxes out their savings from a high scale [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=254.78s)]
*  of production. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=258.82s)]
*  What our analysis shows, and we've run this a number of times, is that if you get much [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=260.44s)]
*  above somewhere between 600 megawatt hours a year and one gigawatt hour a year of lithium-ion [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=264.3s)]
*  battery production in a factory, adding more things in that factory, adding more units [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=270.26s)]
*  or increasing the throughput doesn't help you with costs anymore. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=276.02s)]
*  However, the corollary is that if you centralize a huge amount of production of one thing in [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=279.9s)]
*  one location, your supply chain is simplified, your logistics are simplified, your manpower [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=284.35999999999996s)]
*  distribution is simplified. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=290.18s)]
*  There's a lot of other overhead or exogenous things that can be significant in the overall [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=291.62s)]
*  rundown of what it costs, what it costs. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=298.29999999999995s)]
*  So for now, Tesla will have to find some other way to get to a true price that has wide appeal [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=301.09999999999997s)]
*  in the states. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=305.82s)]
*  Tax credits or production line tweaks can help, but without a scientific breakthrough, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=307.54s)]
*  there are limited ways to make big savings in the battery. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=312.06s)]
*  For consumers, that means another generation of research is due before EVs can really compete [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=315.82s)]
*  on price with their gasoline-fueled alternatives. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3JAj_rWAo&t=320.64s)]
