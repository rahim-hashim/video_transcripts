Video Description: Inflation is among the most powerful forces in financial markets. It dictates the supply of money in the economy, and changes interest rates, which are the cost of borrowing money. Here's how it works, and how the Fed works to regulate it.

# Low Inflation Haunts the Fed: Here's Why | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 21, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI)
*  In 1955, the average price of a movie ticket was 73 cents. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=0.0s)]
*  Today, it's about $9. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=5.24s)]
*  This phenomenon is called inflation, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=7.96s)]
*  the increase in prices of goods and services [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=10.4s)]
*  across an economy over time. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=12.88s)]
*  It refers to everything you buy, from groceries, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=15.24s)]
*  to doctor's visits, to homes. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=17.88s)]
*  Inflation is among the most powerful forces [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=21.0s)]
*  in the economy and financial markets. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=23.28s)]
*  Too much or too little can send the economy spiraling. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=25.48s)]
*  So the inflation rate is a big deal for policymakers, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=29.88s)]
*  and especially the Fed. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=33.0s)]
*  This chart shows the inflation rate over the past century. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=35.0s)]
*  You can see it's become less volatile in recent decades. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  The Fed's long-stated goal is to keep inflation at about 2%, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=42.56s)]
*  not too high and not too low. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  But now, they're worried the rate drifted below 2% too often, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=49.76s)]
*  and they're rethinking the strategy. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=53.32s)]
*  We'll explain why, but first, let's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=55.8s)]
*  look at what causes inflation in the first place. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=58.32s)]
*  There's a lot of debate and few certainties [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=66.24s)]
*  when it comes to what causes inflation, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=68.6s)]
*  but here are some of the bigger theories out there. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=70.92s)]
*  One is increased demand. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=74.12s)]
*  Inflation can occur when there's an increase in demand [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=76.36s)]
*  in goods and services all over the economy, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=78.8s)]
*  from households to businesses to the government. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=81.6s)]
*  Many factors can drive up demand. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=84.8s)]
*  Higher incomes, more access to credit, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=87.64s)]
*  greater government spending, and more. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  What's important to know is that when demand grows faster [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=92.72s)]
*  than supply, businesses can raise their prices. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=95.28s)]
*  This type of inflation may occur in a growing economy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  Supply pressures can also drive inflation. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=102.72s)]
*  When the cost of doing business goes up, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=105.4s)]
*  companies need to raise prices [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=107.32s)]
*  to protect their profit margins. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=108.92s)]
*  Higher wages, higher land costs, and tariffs [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=110.88s)]
*  can all make running a company more expensive [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=114.04s)]
*  and lead to inflation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=116.48s)]
*  The economist Milton Friedman once said [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=118.56s)]
*  that inflation is always and everywhere [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  a monetary phenomenon. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  He was talking about the Fed. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=124.64s)]
*  The Fed is a major factor in inflation. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=127.04s)]
*  It dictates the supply of money in the economy [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=129.76000000000002s)]
*  and changes interest rates, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=132.32s)]
*  which are the cost of borrowing money. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=133.8s)]
*  By changing interest rates, the Fed can influence [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=136.4s)]
*  how many cars, homes, or machines [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  American households and businesses buy, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=141.24s)]
*  and that affects whether prices go up a lot or a little. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=143.52s)]
*  When the Fed lowers rates, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  loans become more attractive to consumers. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=150.28s)]
*  They borrow more to start businesses, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  buy cars and homes, and spend more on consumer goods, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=155.72s)]
*  which can drive up demand and increase inflation. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  On the flip side, the Fed raises rates to limit demand [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=162.4s)]
*  and keep inflation in check. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=165.8s)]
*  Usually, if inflation starts to pick up, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=168.08s)]
*  the Fed considers raising interest rates [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  to limit borrowing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=172.8s)]
*  The hope is that this could keep the economy [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=174.52s)]
*  from overheating and keep inflation down. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=176.52s)]
*  They did this four times in 2018. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=179.36s)]
*  Economists warned that an increase in inflation [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=182.88000000000002s)]
*  can lead people to expect even more, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=185.16000000000003s)]
*  leading to a spiral. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=187.28s)]
*  They worry this could lead to a period [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=189.72000000000003s)]
*  in which wages rise sharply, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=191.36s)]
*  pushing up business costs [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=193.36s)]
*  and forcing further price increases. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=194.96s)]
*  This is what happened in the 1970s [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  when inflation rose as high as 12%. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  Earlier this week, President Nixon issued an inflation alert. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  Inflation is now expected to rise by 7% this year. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=205.56s)]
*  The tyranny of double-digit inflation is our common enemy. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=208.88s)]
*  People were terrified. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=213.28s)]
*  It's worth noting that this phenomenon [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=215.39999999999998s)]
*  is largely absent today because of global labor markets. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  When wages at home rise, companies can hire overseas. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=220.67999999999998s)]
*  Also, when things heat up, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=224.72s)]
*  the Fed is quick to raise rates and limit borrowing. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=226.44s)]
*  Another reason economists often prefer low inflation [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=230.11999999999998s)]
*  is that it makes it easier for people [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=233.04s)]
*  to make accurate long-term financial decisions, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  like starting a business or buying a home. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=237.16s)]
*  If you know how much your money will be worth [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=240.2s)]
*  in one year, two years, and beyond, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=241.88s)]
*  you can plan with that in mind. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=244.04s)]
*  But most economists argue that the economy [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=246.44s)]
*  needs some inflation to stay in balance. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=248.56s)]
*  Moderate inflation gives the economy a cushion [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=251.6s)]
*  in case of a downturn. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=254.04s)]
*  If inflation is already low, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=255.83999999999997s)]
*  policymakers worry a recession could cause it [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=257.56s)]
*  to dip below zero, a phenomenon known as deflation. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=259.68s)]
*  When inflation falls and wages follow, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=264.6s)]
*  people have less money to pay off their debts [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=266.76s)]
*  and start to hoard their money. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=269.0s)]
*  When people hoard their money, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=271.04s)]
*  that means less spending and investing, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=272.44s)]
*  which can make a recession worse or prolonged. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=274.48s)]
*  So what's happening right now? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=279.16s)]
*  Inflation has been below the Fed's target for a long time. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=282.2s)]
*  Right now, some Fed officials want to let it rise [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=285.64s)]
*  above the 2% target to make up for lost ground. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=288.32s)]
*  They say it's likely they'll keep interest rates [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=292.0s)]
*  much lower than in the past, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  a necessary measure to keep the economy growing. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  The Fed's benchmark short-term rate [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=298.56s)]
*  could peak at or slightly above the current range, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=300.44s)]
*  between 2.25% and 2.5%. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=303.28s)]
*  Such low rates leave the Fed less room than in the past [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=306.91999999999996s)]
*  to cut rates when the economy hits a rough patch. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=309.88s)]
*  Remember, the Fed lowers rates to stimulate growth [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=313.12s)]
*  and keep inflation around that 2% mark. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=316.44s)]
*  In each of the last three downturns, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=319.36s)]
*  the Fed lowered rates roughly five percentage points. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=321.4s)]
*  If rates remain low and inflation remains low, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=325.32s)]
*  that may not be possible the next time around. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4_09xaGrI&t=328.32s)]
