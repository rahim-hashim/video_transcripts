# How Amazon, CVS and Walgreens Are Tapping Into the $4 Trillion Healthcare Market | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk)
*  Corporate giants like Amazon, UnitedHealth, and CVS are investing billions into primary care practices, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=0.0s)]
*  with deals tapping into the nation's $4 trillion health care market. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=7.88s)]
*  And it's part of a shift in America's costly health care system, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=11.96s)]
*  moving away from the traditional fee-for-service towards value-based care. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=15.38s)]
*  That model is about paying providers for keeping patients healthy, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=19.46s)]
*  while a fee-for-service model is when medical providers are paid based on the amount of services performed. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=23.0s)]
*  So why are companies spending billions on primary care practices? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=29.08s)]
*  And what could the growing shift to value-based care mean for doctors, patients, and health insurers? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=32.68s)]
*  The U.S. spends more per capita on health care than any other developed nation, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=38.88s)]
*  but still fares worse on most major health measures. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=42.84s)]
*  Health experts say the incentives baked into America's fee-for-service system are part of the problem. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  So critics say that under the fee-for-service model, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=51.8s)]
*  it basically encourages providers to recommend as many services as possible, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=56.08s)]
*  which drives up the cost of health care without necessarily ensuring patients are at the forefront of care. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=60.42s)]
*  Essentially, doctors are rewarded for the volume of health care services they provide. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=66.88s)]
*  Now, companies like Amazon, CVS, and Walgreens are tapping into the growing value-based care movement. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=71.62s)]
*  That model provides incentives to improve patient health outcomes within hospitals and doctors' offices. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=77.72s)]
*  In value-based care, the idea is to keep track of the patient, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=83.8s)]
*  to have more contact between primary care doctors and patients, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=86.88s)]
*  and reduce the amount of time that people actually spend in hospitals, where the costs are very high. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=90.6s)]
*  Those costs are high for patients and health insurers. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=96.0s)]
*  Some private health plans and government programs like Medicare have already adopted this model. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=99.08s)]
*  They want to move more of the health care system to that approach, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=104.0s)]
*  which makes providers accountable for some or all of the cost of their patient's care. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=106.84s)]
*  While value-based care can be traced back decades, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=111.32s)]
*  the 2010 Affordable Care Act accelerated the government's transition to this model. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=114.0s)]
*  The government essentially said that it'll start shifting a lot of health care towards value-based care, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  with the idea being to control costs. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=124.6s)]
*  Still, there can be downsides to a value-based model. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  A key concern is that patients might be delayed in seeing specialists or in undergoing procedures, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=129.68s)]
*  and basically insurers and providers could be doing that to prevent costs from escalating. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=135.64s)]
*  One obstacle behind shifting to a value-based model is a shortage in primary care physicians, or PCPs. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  Because the U.S. health care system rewards more expensive procedures, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=147.44s)]
*  medical students may prefer to become cardiologists or surgeons. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  A cardiologist makes close to $500,000 on average, whereas a primary care physician will make around $200,000. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=154.64s)]
*  In other countries, PCPs compose a much higher proportion of all practicing physicians, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=162.56s)]
*  for example, 45% in France compared to 12% in the United States. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=167.4s)]
*  Yet, PCPs play a central role in keeping people healthy and preventing problems before they begin. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=172.28s)]
*  What happens is many Americans don't see a primary care physician. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=177.76s)]
*  They can't find one or they can't get an appointment for a month. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=181.32s)]
*  Many times, people don't know they have something and they end up in a hospital [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=184.16s)]
*  where they have to get a much more expensive procedure. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  To help reduce higher health costs downstream, a host of companies are now spending billions on primary care practices. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=190.24s)]
*  UnitedHealth, a massive conglomerate that includes 60,000 physicians and an insurance business, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=196.84s)]
*  is one of the furthest along in PCP investments. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=202.08s)]
*  Through its medical provider arm OptumCare, it has been buying up multi-specialty physician practices [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=205.12s)]
*  to provide care at home, virtually, and on-site. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  The idea is to keep people out of the hospital because that's where the costs are highest. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, Amazon is planning to buy primary care company One Medical, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=219.16s)]
*  a practice that operates more than 180 medical offices in 25 U.S. markets. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  The $3.9 billion deal could give Amazon a larger foothold in offering health care services to employers. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=228.28s)]
*  The company CVS Health is also stepping into the mix with a deal to pay $8 billion for Signify Health, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=235.52s)]
*  a company focused on in-home evaluations. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  Ultimately, CVS wants to be not only your pharmacist and your insurer through its Aetnaarm, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=244.48s)]
*  but it also wants to be your village clinic. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=250.64s)]
*  Then there's Walgreens. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=253.39999999999998s)]
*  After buying a controlling stake in startup clinic chain VillageMD, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=255.12s)]
*  it struck a roughly $9 billion deal to combine with Summit Health, a large owner of urgent care centers. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=258.96s)]
*  So how exactly do these companies plan to make money off of these investments? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=265.44s)]
*  In practice, a value-based reimbursement model means providing financial rewards for better patient outcomes. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=269.8s)]
*  It can also be tied to a capitation system, which pays health care providers a fixed amount [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=275.68s)]
*  for each patient they deliver care to per unit of time. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=280.4s)]
*  This prioritizes the patient and cost-saving over services, which can significantly reduce health spending. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=283.64s)]
*  Still, some health care economists worry whether this value-based approach will benefit patients [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=290.12s)]
*  or just reduce costs and improve the bottom line for providers and insurers. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=295.12s)]
*  For example, a primary care physician might be more reluctant to allow a patient to go see a specialist [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=299.48s)]
*  or to perform a more expensive procedure. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=306.0s)]
*  Ultimately, some health care economists say moving away from a fee-for-service model [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  could help temper ballooning health care costs in the U.S. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=314.16s)]
*  As more and more of these bigger companies get into value-based care, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=317.52000000000004s)]
*  it's just going to accelerate the move towards value-based care and away from this fee-for-service model. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2MjLycLLdk&t=321.16s)]
