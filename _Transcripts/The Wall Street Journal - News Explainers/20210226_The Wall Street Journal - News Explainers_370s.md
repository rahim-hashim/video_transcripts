# Behind the Price Tag of the Most Expensive Watches in the World | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o)
*  Take a look at this watch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=0.0s)]
*  It's encased in sapphire crystal. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=2.84s)]
*  It has 60 different movements and includes a dome that rotates in sync with the lunar [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  cycles and it sells for more than $380,000. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  But even this isn't the most expensive watch that money can buy. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=13.74s)]
*  That's because watches, like other types of luxury goods, are subject to a little-known [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=17.2s)]
*  economic principle that allows companies to charge sky-high prices. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=21.72s)]
*  Watches are called Veblen goods and they turn the usual equation of supply and demand on [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=26.14s)]
*  its head. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=30.700000000000003s)]
*  We'll explain. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=31.700000000000003s)]
*  Let's start off with the more obvious reasons why luxury watches command such a high price. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=32.7s)]
*  Number one, the high quality of materials. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  A luxury watch can have hundreds of different parts and these can take hundreds of hours [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=41.78s)]
*  to produce and put together. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=46.46s)]
*  Watches can be made with materials like gold, silver, and diamonds. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  And inside, bearings that help keep time are made with precise synthetic rubies. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=53.32s)]
*  The material is a very important part. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=58.44s)]
*  This is Corinne Segedi, who has analyzed trends in the Swiss watch industry for over a decade. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=60.7s)]
*  A steel or if you have gold or if you have gold and diamonds, of course then already [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=65.88s)]
*  just the price of the material is very significant. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=70.58s)]
*  Number two, luxury watches also take a high caliber of craftsmanship to produce. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=74.1s)]
*  For more complicated pieces with a premium finish, it can take months or even years to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=79.14s)]
*  make a single watch. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=83.54s)]
*  Most of the watches are Swiss made, meaning that it's Swiss watchmakers working on the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=85.26s)]
*  watch and you know that Swiss labor is the most expensive in the world. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=89.0s)]
*  And the more time they spend on the watch, the more cost goes into it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=93.92s)]
*  But Segedi says that while materials and craftsmanship can be expensive, they make up only a fraction [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=97.4s)]
*  of the overall price. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=102.18s)]
*  Number three, the price of a luxury watch is largely subject to what economists and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  marketing experts like Yves Hanania call perceived value. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=108.08s)]
*  Perceived value is how a customer would value what he buys. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  There's a segment out there of men and women would buy watches, which is an indication [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=118.36s)]
*  of their own success or where they stand in life. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=124.6s)]
*  This concept is pretty clear. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=127.44s)]
*  To raise the price, luxury watch companies use marketing tactics to captivate buyers. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=129.02s)]
*  Companies like Rolex sponsor professional sports like car racing and tennis. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=134.36s)]
*  They also tie promotions to high profile events. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=141.72000000000003s)]
*  For example, Buzz Aldrin wore the now iconic Omega Speedmaster Professional when he became [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=144.72000000000003s)]
*  the second man to step foot on the moon. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=149.08s)]
*  The Speedmaster Professional is certified by NASA for manned space missions, which Omega [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  plays up in its branding. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  Since 1995, James Bond has worn an Omega Seamaster in every film. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  Ah, 007. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  One last thing for you. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  Does it do anything? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  It tells the tale. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=167.6s)]
*  Celebrity marketing here can be an important element to the perceived value because if [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=168.6s)]
*  James Bond does wear that watch, I can wear that watch and that gets me a little closer [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  to his lifestyle and his power seduction. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=179.72s)]
*  Hanania explains that this status symbol is also seen as a long term investment. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  There's one very important element of perceived value is when you buy a watch, it's not [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=188.56s)]
*  like you buy it for you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=193.84s)]
*  Not only you see that investment, but you see it as a very emotional thing to pass it [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=195.4s)]
*  on to your kids or even grandkids. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=199.72s)]
*  But in the watch industry, there's a hidden economic factor that drives price as well. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=205.36s)]
*  It's based on the law of demand, which says that if the price of a good goes down, the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=210.4s)]
*  demand for it will go up. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=215.2s)]
*  We've seen this when products go on sale. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=217.4s)]
*  When a TV is discounted, more people want to buy it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=219.8s)]
*  But luxury watches appear to contradict the law of demand. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=223.04s)]
*  This is because they're classified as a Veblen Good, named after the American economist [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=226.44s)]
*  Thorstein Veblen. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=231.4s)]
*  The Veblen effects theory suggests that for certain luxury goods, as the price increases, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  so does the demand. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  Marketing expert Pinar Yildirim says that this is because expensive Veblen goods have [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=239.52s)]
*  the ability to show off one's status. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=244.12s)]
*  Think of an item that helps you to, especially if you're interested in signaling your wealth, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=246.48s)]
*  that helps you to separate from others. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=251.42s)]
*  What's the most effective way to do that? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  It's a very high price, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  Because it's very difficult for others to be able to pay the same price. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=257.82s)]
*  It's very costly for others to imitate you. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=260.98s)]
*  That's why people are willing to pay that extra price, because it helps them to really [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  separate themselves from others. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=267.44s)]
*  And for many high-end watches, there can be an additional twist. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=269.14s)]
*  The more expensive it is, the more exclusive it becomes. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=272.2s)]
*  And the harder it is to attain, the more that people want to own it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=275.6s)]
*  This is called the snob effect. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=278.98s)]
*  It helps explain why Veblen goods carry a high perception of value, which is why brands [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=281.16s)]
*  like Richard Mille and Patek Philippe can charge hundreds of thousands of dollars or [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=285.70000000000005s)]
*  more for a single watch. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  And this is not just luxury watches. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=292.3s)]
*  It's true for luxury cars. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=294.04s)]
*  It's true for luxury handbags, luxury shoes. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=295.6s)]
*  It's the items that help you signal your status, your wealth. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=298.20000000000005s)]
*  But the Veblen and snob effects only work up to a certain point. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=303.56s)]
*  This is what's known as the sweet spot in pricing. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=307.16s)]
*  At a certain price, even demand from luxury buyers will start to decrease if they feel [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=309.84s)]
*  that the higher price no longer represents a higher level of value. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=314.08s)]
*  And there's another characteristic of Veblen goods that separates them from normal goods [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=318.06s)]
*  as well. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=322.12s)]
*  When you cut down on the price of a normal good, you will typically find higher numbers [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=323.12s)]
*  of people who want to purchase that item. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=327.74s)]
*  But this is not necessarily true for Veblen goods. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=330.08s)]
*  If you cut down on the price of a Veblen good, you might actually find fewer number of people [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=332.44s)]
*  wanting to buy that item because it no longer helps you to signal your wealth as effectively [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=337.08s)]
*  as it did before. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=341.96s)]
*  Unlike some designer goods that do go on sale, Veblen goods are items that are priced to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=343.2s)]
*  be more exclusive and therefore more unattainable. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=347.32s)]
*  This is why they're rarely discounted. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=350.54s)]
*  It's the idea that the cheaper an item is, the less status and therefore perceived value [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=352.28s)]
*  it holds. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_Lkdh117o&t=357.72s)]
