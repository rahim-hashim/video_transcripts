# Iran’s Military Capabilities Against Israel, Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY)
*  Israel has launched one of the largest attacks on Iran in history. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=0.0s)]
*  It crosses a threshold that we've thought about, considered about, war-gamed for 15 [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=5.16s)]
*  years at the very least. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=10.58s)]
*  It's really brought this conflict, the Iranian-Israeli conflict, into uncharted territory. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=12.32s)]
*  The first strikes hit areas throughout Iran, including several key nuclear and military [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=18.12s)]
*  sites. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=22.96s)]
*  Now, Iran is hitting back. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=24.6s)]
*  But Tehran is entering this conflict in a weaker position than it held in the past. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=27.200000000000003s)]
*  Here's what its military capabilities look like. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Iran's supreme leader leads Tehran's large military operation, two branches of its own [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=35.4s)]
*  military and a network of proxies that extend outside of its borders. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  In the past, these proxies have been Iran's first line of defense. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  The Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s was devastating to Iran. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=50.24s)]
*  It convinced them that they never wanted war to return to Iran. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=53.76s)]
*  So dealing with the proxies kept war away from Iran's doorstep. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=56.68s)]
*  Israel has already kind of laid the groundwork for this attack against Iran by either destroying [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=60.76s)]
*  or severely degrading Iran's proxies in Gaza and in Lebanon. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=66.56s)]
*  So much so that they're basically no longer potent military forces. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=73.08s)]
*  The difference now is that Iran is all alone. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=77.7s)]
*  And when Iran is all alone, it really only has one option to hit Israel, and that's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=80.4s)]
*  to use its missiles and drones. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=85.36s)]
*  Iran has sophisticated missiles that can strike at various ranges and reach well into Israel. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  Israel's ambassador to the United States told CNN that Iran has... [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=93.48s)]
*  Considerable volume of ballistic missiles somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,000. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=97.68s)]
*  Ballistic missiles are large and destructive, but its arsenal also includes less powerful [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=101.2s)]
*  and less expensive cruise missiles and drones, which can fly low and be hard to detect. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=105.4s)]
*  In previous strikes, Iran has used a mixture of these missiles to overwhelm Israel's defense [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=111.48s)]
*  system. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=116.44000000000001s)]
*  Iran tries to do when it attacks Israel is to shoot all of these things at once. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=117.44000000000001s)]
*  So you have things flying at different levels, at different trajectories, at different speeds, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=123.36000000000001s)]
*  which is meant to saturate radar systems, right? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  So that Israel has to pick and choose to knock this down, to knock that down. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=132.3s)]
*  But with all of that, you're hoping that something gets through. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  Iran staged a retaliatory attack on Tel Aviv and a number of Israeli bases in October, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=142.98000000000002s)]
*  after Israel killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  Roughly 180 missiles were launched, and some were able to penetrate the defense system. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=151.54000000000002s)]
*  But no deaths were reported. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=156.78s)]
*  Most of the missiles that got through landed sort of in parts of the military bases that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=158.62s)]
*  were not occupied. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=163.36s)]
*  Patches of sand or a runway or a warehouse, but they didn't do significant damage. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=164.86s)]
*  When Israel launched the recent strikes on Tehran, it hit some residential areas. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=171.70000000000002s)]
*  Later, Iran launched a barrage of missiles aimed at populated areas in and around Tel [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  Aviv and breached the defense system. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=182.28s)]
*  Those types of attacks would have a lot less strategic utility, but they could be much [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=185.04s)]
*  more devastating to Israel in the sense that they could kill dozens, hundreds of people. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  Because Iran needs to launch so many missiles in order to make that breach happen, the battle [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=195.62s)]
*  comes down to numbers. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=200.16s)]
*  Even though they have thousands of missiles, because they have to fire hundreds of missiles [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=203.92s)]
*  each time in order to penetrate Israel's defenses, it's not really a stockpile that would allow [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=208.42s)]
*  them to sustain a long, drawn-out conflict that was fought through the air. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=214.48s)]
*  But Israel also can't fully defend itself on its own. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=220.22s)]
*  In the recent attacks and in both of Iran's attacks on Israel last year, the U.S. assisted [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=223.58s)]
*  in intercepting the missile barrages. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  Other allies have also offered assistance. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT4ntnutmJY&t=231.68s)]
