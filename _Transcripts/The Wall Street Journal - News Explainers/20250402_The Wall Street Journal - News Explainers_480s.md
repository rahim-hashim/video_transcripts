Video Description: President Trump says cars made in the U.S. will face “absolutely no tariff,” but it’s not so simple. No car is built from 100% U.S. parts—not even the U.S.-built Ford F-150 pickup truck. Major components of the car are from Mexico, Canada and South Korea, which could all be a part of the auto tariffs.

WSJ takes a look inside a Ford F-150 to better understand Trump’s slew of new tariffs and why automakers are warning it could backfire.

# Trump’s Auto Tariffs: We Broke Down an F-150 to Explain Industry Impact | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE)
*  President Trump's auto tariffs are here and that means a 25% tariff on all cars [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=0.0s)]
*  that are not made in the United States. If they're made in the United States, there's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=6.2s)]
*  absolutely no tariff. But no car, not even a US-built Ford F-150, is 100% US- [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=9.52s)]
*  made. Just look inside. It's made up of thousands and thousands of parts. Those [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=16.8s)]
*  parts come from over 24 different countries. Countries like Mexico, Canada, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Trump wants these parts to say made in the US. But moving all of this is not so [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=27.8s)]
*  simple. To lift and shift that whole thing, that's kind of like saying, oh, pick [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  up the state of Maine and move it over to Wyoming. Could you do it? I suppose you [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=37.4s)]
*  could, but man, it would be tough duty. So let's break it down to understand what [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=41.4s)]
*  Trump is trying to do with a slew of new tariffs and why automakers are warning [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=46.16s)]
*  it could backfire. This chart shows where cars sold in the US are coming from. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  All of these cars now face that 25% auto tariff. But this 53% of US-made cars is [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=56.919999999999995s)]
*  also affected by that tariff because of all of those foreign parts. Some of the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=64.64s)]
*  major components, this is for the Ford F-150. They have an alternator, create [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=69.44s)]
*  current. It's from Mexico. We have half shafts. These deliver torque to the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=73.4s)]
*  wheels from the driveline. They're from Canada. We have tires, of course, five of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=77.16s)]
*  them. These come from Korea. Of course, you have to have wheels, in this case, a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=81.12s)]
*  styled tractor wheels. These all come from Mexico. Those tires from South [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=85.24s)]
*  Korea would face that auto tariff and any reciprocal or universal tariff [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=89.44s)]
*  placed on the country. Those parts from Canada and Mexico, well, that's where it [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  gets more complicated. Eventually, they would face that auto tariff, any [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  reciprocal or universal tariff and an additional Mexico-Canada tariff. But the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=101.72s)]
*  White House said parts compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, or [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  USMCA, remain tariff free until there is a process to apply tariffs to their [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  non-US content. And for some parts, like a transmission, there will be a lot of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=115.2s)]
*  content to consider. When you realize what goes into an automatic transmission, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  that's what this is. And so you can see this plethora of parts, gears and seals, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=126.04s)]
*  springs, fasteners, valves and shafts, all these different parts. They can come [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=132.96s)]
*  from different suppliers and those suppliers can be located pretty much [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=140.88s)]
*  anywhere in the world. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=145.12s)]
*  Take a look at this map showing how Canadian manufacturer Lidamar creates [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=146.28s)]
*  transmissions for the US market today. It takes seven border crossings before [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=150.28s)]
*  that part is in a car being sold in the US. These three crossings into the US [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=154.88s)]
*  would eventually face Trump's tariffs. And even if the manufacturing of all of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  this was moved into the US, this part, the raw steel, would still be subject to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=164.72s)]
*  Trump's 25% tariff on imported steel and aluminum. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=170.32s)]
*  This is going to be disruptive on day one. It's going to increase the cost of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=173.76s)]
*  doing business. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=178.12s)]
*  The total amount depends on the vehicle. A Cox Automotive estimate shows a car [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=179.44s)]
*  made in the US would incur $3,000 in costs from the Canada-Mexico tariffs, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  plus another $3,000 from the tariffs on foreign-made auto parts. Then research [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=189.12s)]
*  shows an added $400 for the steel and aluminum tariffs and more for any [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=194.56s)]
*  reciprocal or universal tariffs. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=199.76s)]
*  Have you heard any concerns from the automakers, though, about the tariffs on [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=202.16s)]
*  parts that will go into effect over the coming weeks? About what that's going [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=205.12s)]
*  to mean for the price of American-made cars? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, I gave them a big break for a month. I didn't charge them anything, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  you know, for a big month for that first month. And they brought a lot of [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  material into this country because they could bring it in with that tariff. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=215.23999999999998s)]
*  But eventually, added production costs could change what cars buyers see on [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=219.0s)]
*  dealer lots. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=223.48s)]
*  You can see a stop in production of a number of vehicles, some of which are [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=224.44s)]
*  very important to some of the automakers. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=228.0s)]
*  Trump's goal, however, is to pressure automakers to make them in the US [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  instead. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=234.16s)]
*  This is going to lead to the construction of a lot of plants. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  And the White House said the duties on Canada and Mexico are also meant to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=239.88s)]
*  disrupt the drug trade. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=243.84s)]
*  We've lost millions of people due to fentanyl. It comes mostly from China, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=245.39999999999998s)]
*  but it comes through Mexico and it comes through Canada. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=249.88s)]
*  The trade group representing Ford, GM and Solantis said it's critical that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  tariffs are done in a way that preserves the competitiveness of the North [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=256.48s)]
*  American auto sector. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=260.08s)]
*  North American is the key there. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=261.84s)]
*  Because of the Trump negotiated USMCA and NAFTA before it, automakers have [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=264.2s)]
*  essentially viewed these countries as borderless. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=269.2s)]
*  We have really built the industry around that free trade zone that's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=272.56s)]
*  existed for so long. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=277.48s)]
*  It's why Mexico and Canada exported about $75 billion in passenger cars [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=279.52s)]
*  and more than $100 billion in auto parts to the US last year. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  So shrinking supply chains to just the US? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=288.8s)]
*  If you had to move production of a vehicle or even a complex system like an [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  engine, a transmission, an axle, and you're making that in Canada or you're [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=297.6s)]
*  making that in Mexico and you just want to move the plant, that could be [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=301.92s)]
*  years. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=305.0s)]
*  Analysts say even shifting a foreign-made part to a US supplier can take [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  months. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=310.48s)]
*  We have well-established, very detailed testing plans for every component on [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=311.2s)]
*  a vehicle. And we don't get to skip those just because we might want to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=318.52s)]
*  or it might be easy, right? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=323.44s)]
*  Because it's a safety and quality issue. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=325.16s)]
*  It costs money and it costs lives when we get those things wrong. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=329.0s)]
*  So either choice, moving production or facing the tariffs, come with added [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=332.36s)]
*  costs, some of which economists say will be passed on to consumers. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=337.44s)]
*  That will push up already elevated car prices. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=341.64s)]
*  This could then tamp down demand and slow production. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=344.76s)]
*  If there's less production, there'll be less demand for workers in the North [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=348.44s)]
*  American auto industry. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=352.32s)]
*  Even before you get the cut in profitability, there'll probably be a push [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=353.92s)]
*  for more labor-saving investment in US production to try to compensate for [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=357.96s)]
*  the increased costs elsewhere in the production process. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=364.28s)]
*  That labor-saving investment, analysts say, will come in the form of [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=367.79999999999995s)]
*  automation. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  When you move production to the US, you do it because you need to be close, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=371.96s)]
*  but it doesn't necessarily bring a lot of jobs with it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=378.96s)]
*  It brings a lot of automation. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=382.55999999999995s)]
*  But the United Auto Workers Union applauded Trump's tariff on foreign [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=383.91999999999996s)]
*  autos, adding it's now on the automakers to bring back good union jobs to the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=387.59999999999997s)]
*  US. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=392.35999999999996s)]
*  To make investments months or years into the future, automakers need [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=393.24s)]
*  certainty and stability. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  Just they want it to be clear what's going to happen, when it's going to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  happen and why it's going to happen. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=404.24s)]
*  But automakers are still waiting for clarity on the extent and application of [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  the various tariffs, especially after the pause and then temporary exemption [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=411.8s)]
*  from the Mexico-Canada tariffs. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=416.32s)]
*  The uncertainty of whether and how long these tariffs will stick around is [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=418.36s)]
*  creating real dollars waste in terms of warehousing and trucking and call it [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=423.36s)]
*  soft waste, wasted time, wasted energy, wasted attention that could be better [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=428.84000000000003s)]
*  deployed building and designing the next vehicle, the next system. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  That time spent debating if this alternator should continue to come from [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=438.44s)]
*  Mexico or this crossbeam from Canada is to some a distraction from the larger [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=442.12s)]
*  disruptors in the industry, namely the fast moving Chinese competition. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=447.8s)]
*  China is now the world's largest vehicle exporter. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=452.6s)]
*  Very tumultuous time in the industry for sure. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=455.88s)]
*  Things are changing faster than they ever did before. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=459.68s)]
*  And at the end of the day, you have to remember it's not the big that eat the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=462.8s)]
*  small, it's the fast that eat the slow. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=466.44s)]
*  And so whatever you are, don't be the slow, move quickly. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLpUEACVBlE&t=469.24s)]
