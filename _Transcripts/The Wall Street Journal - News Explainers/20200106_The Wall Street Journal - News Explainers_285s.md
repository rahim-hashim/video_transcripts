# The Debate Over Stock Buybacks, Explained  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw)
*  In the fourth quarter of 2019, companies on the S&P 500 spent an estimated $189 billion buying back their own shares from the stock market. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=0.0s)]
*  It was the highest in three quarters, but not the highest on record. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=12.0s)]
*  In the final quarter of 2018, the number was about $223 billion, a high point on a decade-long trend. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=16.0s)]
*  In all, since 2010, companies on the S&P have poured more than $5.3 trillion into repurchasing their own shares. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=24.0s)]
*  Analysts say buybacks have been a driving force in the decade-long bull market. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=33.0s)]
*  But there's some argument over whether they're good for the economy. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=37.0s)]
*  Skeptics say the money used on stock buybacks would be better spent elsewhere, like building new factories or exploring new opportunities altogether. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=40.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, proponents say buybacks are putting money right where it belongs, with shareholders. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=49.0s)]
*  To understand the debate, you have to understand how stock buybacks work. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=54.0s)]
*  The debate around stock buybacks has to do with how companies use their cash. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=65.0s)]
*  They have access to quite a bit of it right now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=70.0s)]
*  The tax cuts in 2017, relatively high earnings and low interest rates have all added to corporate cash stockpiles. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=72.0s)]
*  When a company is flush, it has options for what to do with its money. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=80.0s)]
*  It can buy other companies. It can spend on research and development. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=84.0s)]
*  It can buy new equipment, buildings or technologies. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=88.0s)]
*  Or it can return money to shareholders. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=92.0s)]
*  This can take the form of dividends or stock buybacks. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=94.0s)]
*  In the past 10 years, the top 20 companies on the S&P 500 bought back about $1.3 trillion in shares, with Apple leading the way by far. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=99.0s)]
*  In a stock buyback, a company purchases its own shares from shareholders and it takes them off the market, leaving fewer shares outstanding. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=108.0s)]
*  This changes the math on the remaining shares in a key way. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=117.0s)]
*  It boosts a metric called earnings per share, or EPS. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=121.0s)]
*  The most basic equation for EPS is the company's net income divided by the number of outstanding shares. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=125.0s)]
*  So when this number shrinks, the EPS rises. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=132.0s)]
*  So if a company has a net income of $1,000 and has 100 shares outstanding, its EPS is $10. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=136.0s)]
*  But if it buys back 10 of those shares, the EPS rises to $11.11. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=144.0s)]
*  Higher per share earnings makes stocks look good. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=150.0s)]
*  An analyst at the S&P Dow Jones Indices said that a little more than one in five companies on the S&P 500 reduced share counts by at least 4% through buybacks in the most recent quarter, boosting earnings per share. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=153.0s)]
*  Stock buybacks can be a good deal for remaining shareholders. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=166.0s)]
*  They tend to benefit executives because rising stock prices make their stock options more valuable. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=170.0s)]
*  This is one of the criticisms of stock buybacks. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=176.0s)]
*  The people who decide what to do with the extra cash often stand to benefit. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=179.0s)]
*  Skeptics say that money is better used on growing the company. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=183.0s)]
*  Here's a chart that looks at the change in business investment since 2013. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=187.0s)]
*  You can see it's gone negative three times. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=191.0s)]
*  Critics of buybacks say the practice is partly to blame for the lagging business investment. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=194.0s)]
*  In 2019, Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders argued that buybacks restrain companies from investing in R&D, equipment, higher wages, paid medical leave, retirement benefits, and worker training. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=199.0s)]
*  And Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida unveiled a proposal that would change how investors are taxed when companies buyback shares. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=213.0s)]
*  Analysts also say that another worrying sign is that buybacks have coincided with a rise in corporate debt levels. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=221.0s)]
*  Some worry that companies are taking out debt to finance the stock buybacks. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=228.0s)]
*  Proponents of buyback say there's no real link between share repurchases and tepid capital investment, and that companies could be deferring investment for other reasons. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=233.0s)]
*  Maybe they're pessimistic about future demand and economic growth, and they don't see attractive investment opportunities for the company. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=242.0s)]
*  This camp says that if a company sees no profitable use of their money, they should return it to shareholders, who then have the choice to invest it on more profitable ventures. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=250.0s)]
*  Some also say the rise in buybacks is overstated. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=259.0s)]
*  Companies regularly issue stock as part of compensation, and the rise in buybacks has partly served to offset those new shares. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=262.0s)]
*  As this debate continues, one thing is clear. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=269.0s)]
*  Buybacks are now a big part of the landscape of American finance. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=272.0s)]
*  There's no sign that that's about to change. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyvkbwR6Uw&t=276.0s)]
