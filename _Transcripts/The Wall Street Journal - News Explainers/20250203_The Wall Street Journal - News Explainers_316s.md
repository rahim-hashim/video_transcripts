Video Description: President Trump’s aggressive move to place tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China could trigger a trade war. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum negotiated with Trump at the last minute, putting tariffs on Mexico on hold for a month. Meanwhile, Trudeau and Canada are planning on responding to the U.S. trade action with 25% tariffs of their own on specific products like lumber, household appliances and fruit. 

WSJ’s economics reporter Jeanne Whalen explains how the tariffs can drive up prices for consumers.

# How New Tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China Are Hitting U.S. Consumers | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds)
*  President Trump is slapping stiff tariffs on America's top three trading partners, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=0.0s)]
*  Canada, Mexico and China. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  They owe us a lot of money and I'm sure they're going to pay. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=7.34s)]
*  Trump is imposing a 25 percent tariff on nearly all goods from Canada and Mexico, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=10.8s)]
*  and an additional 10 percent on imports from China. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=15.82s)]
*  Mexico's president negotiated with Trump at the last minute, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=18.78s)]
*  putting the tariffs on Mexico on hold for a month. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=21.98s)]
*  Meanwhile, Canada is planning retaliation. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=25.18s)]
*  Canada will be responding to the U.S. trade action with 25 percent tariffs. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=28.14s)]
*  Here's how Trump's new tariffs are different and why many economists and politicians say you, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=33.94s)]
*  the consumer, might have to pay the price. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=38.980000000000004s)]
*  To measure the impact, let's look at the numbers. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=42.94s)]
*  The U.S. imported roughly $893 billion worth of goods from Mexico and Canada in 2023. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=45.34s)]
*  Nearly all of those imports will now have a 25 percent tariff, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  meaning if an American importer wants one of their goods, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=55.1s)]
*  they'll have to pay that tariff to the U.S. government. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=57.7s)]
*  Consumers will likely notice this quite quickly in the cost of fresh produce at the grocery store. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=60.02s)]
*  Almost all of America's raspberry, strawberry and avocado supply comes from Mexico, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=65.82000000000001s)]
*  as well as most of the country's supply of beer and tequila and mezcal. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=70.94s)]
*  On the other side, the U.S. gets about 80 percent of its frozen french fries, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=74.66s)]
*  70 percent of its lumber and 60 percent of its maple syrup from Canada. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=78.34s)]
*  It's a really big deal because at the moment we really don't have tariffs on any goods [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=82.66s)]
*  coming from Mexico and Canada under the free trade agreements that we have in North America. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=87.22s)]
*  But Canada's most significant import to the U.S., natural gas, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=92.46s)]
*  which makes up 99 percent of America's supply, now has a 10 percent tariff on it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=96.46s)]
*  The administration is worried about causing too many price spikes at the gasoline pump for American consumers. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=101.46s)]
*  Trump's tariffs risk pushing Mexico and Canada into recession, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=107.9s)]
*  as both nations send 80 percent of their exports into the U.S. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=111.34s)]
*  But Canada is planning precision strikes against U.S. exports, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=115.06s)]
*  and the impact of that could be contrary to what Trump claims. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=118.58s)]
*  The tariffs are going to make us very rich and very strong. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=121.78s)]
*  Since Canada has a much smaller economy, it can pose the same impact on the U.S. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=125.7s)]
*  But Canada is betting that if it causes enough disruption, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=130.42000000000002s)]
*  Trump, who campaigned on lowering prices after a period of elevated inflation, will back down. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=133.7s)]
*  Like the American tariffs, our response will also be far-reaching [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=139.54s)]
*  and include everyday items such as American beer, wine and bourbon. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=144.74s)]
*  Mexico's president struck a deal with Trump for a one-month pause on U.S. tariffs on Mexico. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=150.1s)]
*  In return, she agreed to deploy 10,000 Mexican soldiers to the border to fight fentanyl trafficking. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=155.1s)]
*  China also signaled that it's eager to get trade talks going with Trump. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=169.54s)]
*  While it's unclear what will happen next, experts say a trade war between the U.S. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=172.98s)]
*  and its largest trading partners would hit U.S. income, hurt employment and increase inflation. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=177.22s)]
*  So if all of that is true, why is Trump so keen to use tariffs? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=183.06s)]
*  Number one is the people that are poured into our country so horribly and so much. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=187.26s)]
*  Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=191.94s)]
*  And number three are the massive subsidies that we're giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=195.46s)]
*  I think most people do see Trump using these tariffs as a bargaining tool. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=202.38s)]
*  He wants something out of Canada and Mexico. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=207.70000000000002s)]
*  The White House said the duties would remain in place until Mexico, Canada and China stop fentanyl smuggling and illegal migration. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=210.34s)]
*  But there are some industries that might benefit. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=217.5s)]
*  The U.S. steel industry and domestic aluminum producers have been asking Trump to raise more tariffs against imported steel and aluminum. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=220.26s)]
*  They say Mexican factories have been dumping a lot of very low cost steel and aluminum in the U.S. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=229.78s)]
*  against commitments that Mexico has made over the years and that those low cost imports have undermined U.S. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=236.5s)]
*  producers who have higher costs and forced them to idle or close factories. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=244.42s)]
*  It's unclear how long Trump plans to leave these tariffs on. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=249.54s)]
*  Some experts say that decision will be the biggest measure of its impact. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=252.66s)]
*  If the companies feel that Trump is just leaving these on short term in order to get something out of Canada and Mexico, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=256.62s)]
*  they're not going to rip up their manufacturing footprint. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=263.7s)]
*  At the center of all of this is the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=266.82s)]
*  Our own Wall Street Journal reporting has shown that some of Trump's aides say that he's actually pushing both Mexico and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=270.62s)]
*  Canada to renegotiate the free trade agreement that we do have. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  And these tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China might just be the beginning. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=282.66s)]
*  Eventually, we're going to put tariffs on chips. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  We're going to put tariffs on oil and gas. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=289.62s)]
*  We're going to be putting tariffs on steel and aluminum and ultimately copper. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=291.98s)]
*  We also expect to see some confusion and probably delays at the borders. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=295.98s)]
*  We could see goods backing up in warehouses as different trading partners try to sort through the new rules. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=300.46000000000004s)]
*  So all of that is probably ahead in the coming days and weeks. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6Wk_Qr9ds&t=306.26s)]
