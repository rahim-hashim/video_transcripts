# To Gauge How the Economy Is Doing, Ask Purchasing Managers  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 24, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y)
*  Here's a chart that anyone who looks at the economy is going to pay attention to. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a purchasing manager's index or PMI. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=5.2s)]
*  This one looks at global manufacturing. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=8.16s)]
*  50 represents the midline between expansion and contraction. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=10.96s)]
*  When the line rises above 50, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  it suggests manufacturing is increasing or improving. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=16.92s)]
*  When it dips below, it suggests a decrease. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  In 2018 and 2019 during the US-China trade war, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=23.48s)]
*  investors embraced global manufacturing PMIs [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=27.76s)]
*  as a leading barometer of economic health. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=30.44s)]
*  Traders and policymakers looked to them to answer the question, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=33.64s)]
*  how will Trump's trade policy affect the world's economy? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=37.24s)]
*  And several times over those years, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=41.0s)]
*  the earliest and clearest cracks showed up in PMIs. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=42.68s)]
*  To understand what makes PMIs so popular, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=47.32s)]
*  first you have to understand how they work. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=49.8s)]
*  For a scan of what's going on in the economy, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=51.92s)]
*  PMIs survey the world's purchasing managers. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=54.4s)]
*  The purchasing manager is the executive within a firm [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=57.52s)]
*  who's responsible for buying everything, essentially. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=60.08s)]
*  This could be the inputs that go into the production line [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=62.96s)]
*  or it could be the desks required for new employees. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  A purchasing manager sits at an important juncture [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=69.44s)]
*  in a company's supply chain. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=72.08s)]
*  The purchasing manager is the right person to speak to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=74.0s)]
*  because he's got to answer the questions that are being asked. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=76.0s)]
*  The purchasing manager is the right person to speak to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=79.11999999999999s)]
*  because he's got access to a wonderful source of data, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=81.11999999999999s)]
*  whether that's how much the firm's going to be producing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=84.32s)]
*  in the next few months, whether it's taking on more employees, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=86.88s)]
*  whether its inventories are high [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=90.64s)]
*  and it's going to have to start scaling back on its purchasing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=92.96s)]
*  The purchasing manager really knows everything about the firm. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=96.16s)]
*  For PMIs, purchasing managers answer questions [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=98.88s)]
*  about what's going on on the ground. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=101.36s)]
*  Compared to a month ago, have there been changes in production, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=103.52s)]
*  new orders, prices or backlogs? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=106.88s)]
*  For each question, the managers can give one of three answers. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  Higher, the same or lower? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=113.52s)]
*  The index assigns a different value to each of those answers. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=116.24s)]
*  Higher gets a one, the same gets a 0.5 and lower gets a zero. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=119.84s)]
*  The answers are then added up, weighed and averaged into a score. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  And these scores are plotted onto a chart, like this one, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=128.8s)]
*  where the 50 line marks the middle between growth and contraction. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=132.24s)]
*  When a manufacturing PMI slides and dips below 50, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=136.16s)]
*  policymakers take notice. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=139.52s)]
*  Through most of 2018, official forecasts, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=142.0s)]
*  like those from the Federal Reserve and International Monetary Fund, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=144.56s)]
*  held steady. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=147.84s)]
*  And until the fourth quarter, the stock market climbed. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=149.12s)]
*  But global manufacturing PMIs were telling a different story. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=152.8s)]
*  You can see it here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=156.96s)]
*  For much of 2018, manufacturing output was sliding. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  Then in June of 2019, it dipped below 50, implying a downward pull on the economy. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  It's the most up-to-date source of information on business conditions. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  So that's got an advantage over data such as GDP, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=174.88000000000002s)]
*  which often tends to be produced with a lag. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=179.44s)]
*  Having up-to-date information is especially important for policymakers [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=181.84s)]
*  selling interest rates. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=184.96s)]
*  If you can get a quick view on how the economy is changing, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=186.56s)]
*  you can adjust interest rates faster, meaning less adjustment is needed. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=191.28s)]
*  If you wait until the economy is already in a recession, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=196.32s)]
*  then you're going to have to start slashing interest rates. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=200.39999999999998s)]
*  But if you've got an indication that the economy is edging towards recession, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  you only need to do a small tweak to interest rates. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  Track the PMI numbers against news flow on the trade war, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  and you can see them line up. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=213.04s)]
*  The blue line shows new export orders. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=215.04s)]
*  And the red and green lines show news flow on the US-China trade war. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=217.92s)]
*  Red lines are when talks moved in a negative direction, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  and green lines are when they moved positive. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  Right here, where the line turns around, that reflects the Fed's policy shift in 2019. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=229.11999999999998s)]
*  Officials began easing policy after indicators like the PMI [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=235.28s)]
*  began to show the economy was softening. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=238.88s)]
*  PMIs drew attention during this period because they aren't revised [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=241.76s)]
*  the way some government data series are. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=244.88s)]
*  Revisions are useful, but they can make the trend in the data harder to see. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=247.2s)]
*  There's a lot of economic official data out there, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=251.2s)]
*  which also gets revised heavily, sends misleading signals. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=254.56s)]
*  So the PMI is really useful in acting as a challenger data to some of those GDP numbers, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=257.68s)]
*  employment numbers, to make sure the policymakers have confidence, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  even in the official data that they're watching. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBzV9KTF0Y&t=266.15999999999997s)]
