# How to Survive the Longest Flight in the World | The Middle Seat
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 16, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g)
*  Hi, I'm Scott McCartney, travel columnist with the Wall Street Journal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm here to give you some tips on flying to the other side of the world in a seat like [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=7.28s)]
*  this and I'll be testing my tips on the longest airline flight ever, taking off from Newark, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=10.84s)]
*  New Jersey and landing in Singapore. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=16.96s)]
*  I'm in Newark, ready to go on the longest flight in the world. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=23.76s)]
*  Feeling good now? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=26.48s)]
*  Let's see what it's like when I get there. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=27.48s)]
*  On an aircraft, humidity levels are 20% or less. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=31.8s)]
*  For reference, a comfortable level is 40 to 50%. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=35.68s)]
*  This dries out your mouth, skin and everything else. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=39.54s)]
*  It can cause fatigue, headaches, bad breath, muscle and joint aches. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=42.72s)]
*  So drink up and think about your food choices. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=47.16s)]
*  Pick items with higher water content. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=49.96s)]
*  For example, Singapore Airlines has replaced potatoes with riced cauliflower. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=52.72s)]
*  And one of my favorite tips? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=57.8s)]
*  Bring saline solution to keep your nose moist and eye drops to keep your eyes moist. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=59.68s)]
*  Put them in a baggie that you can store in a seat back pocket so you have easy access. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=65.6s)]
*  Tip number two, clean your seat. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=70.92s)]
*  Dehydration dries out the mucous membranes in your nose which trap unwanted germs. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=73.12s)]
*  Without them, you're more likely to catch things from your fellow passengers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=78.4s)]
*  But unlike what you might think, sickness isn't spread through the airplane's circulating [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=82.12s)]
*  air supply. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=86.48s)]
*  It's surfaces you need to watch out for. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=87.92s)]
*  So embrace your inner germaphobe and wipe down your arm wraps and tray table and seat back. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=90.44s)]
*  And breathe easier knowing that modern airplanes have advanced air filtration systems that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=97.9s)]
*  trap germs and bacteria almost to operating room standards. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=102.44s)]
*  So open that air vent to full blast and aim it at your nose. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=106.54s)]
*  That's the cleanest air you're going to get. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=109.96s)]
*  Tip three, move. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  Depending on your airline, you may be only looking at 31 or 32 inches of space in coach [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=114.24s)]
*  which is awfully tight for a long flight. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=119.44s)]
*  Rather than be uncomfortable, get up frequently. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=124.83999999999999s)]
*  If you don't, there are side effects like decreased blood flow which can increase the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=128.28s)]
*  chances of blood clots. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=132.24s)]
*  Try setting an alarm on your phone for three hours into your flight. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=133.95999999999998s)]
*  If you haven't gotten up and moved yet, it's time to stand. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=137.72s)]
*  Drink some tea or coffee. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=141.4s)]
*  While they will dehydrate you, they have the benefit of being diuretics which will force [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=142.96s)]
*  you to get up and go to the bathroom. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=147.44s)]
*  And exercise. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=150.0s)]
*  Some airlines including Singapore are putting exercise videos in the entertainment system. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=151.12s)]
*  Things you can do while sitting down to increase blood flow. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=156.56s)]
*  Tip four, adjust your body clock. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=160.52s)]
*  Jet lag starts in the air. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=163.52s)]
*  The cause of this common problem is that your circadian rhythm gets mixed up, causing fatigue, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  headaches, difficulty concentrating and even nausea. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=171.04s)]
*  So try setting your watch to the local time right after takeoff. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  That will help you know when to eat and sleep during the flight. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=179.48s)]
*  On a very long flight, getting at least some sleep is important and airlines will help [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  with this by dimming the lights and lowering the temperature in the cabin at ideal times [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=187.12s)]
*  for sleep. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  So take their cues. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  It's about everybody's sleep on the plane. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=194.8s)]
*  It's nap time. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=197.12s)]
*  But sleep is personal, so do what's best for you. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=198.12s)]
*  For me, that's earplugs and Ambien. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=201.56s)]
*  Tip five, limit the booze. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=205.32000000000002s)]
*  Alcohol both dehydrates you and messes with your circadian rhythm. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=207.72s)]
*  This is kind of a perfect storm for a long flight. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=211.4s)]
*  But this is one of the pleasures of travel. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=213.88000000000002s)]
*  So take advantage if you want. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=215.88000000000002s)]
*  Just not too much. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=218.0s)]
*  Do all that and you should hopefully walk off the airplane feeling as good as possible. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=220.72s)]
*  I'm off the plane after more than 18 hours. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=228.16s)]
*  Legs are a little shaky. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=230.68s)]
*  I didn't get much sleep. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=231.68s)]
*  Pulled an all-nighter. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=233.16s)]
*  But I'm actually feeling better than I thought. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=234.16s)]
*  This is the new way of travel and it's going to take some adjusting for people. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=236.04s)]
*  You're going to have to get in the right frame of mind to take on this marathon and you're [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=240.32s)]
*  going to have to make some preparations that really will make a difference. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLebsrBn13g&t=245.44s)]
