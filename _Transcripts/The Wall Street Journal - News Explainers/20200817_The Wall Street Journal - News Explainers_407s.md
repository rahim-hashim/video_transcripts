# The Rise and Fall of Brooks Brothers  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 17, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew)
*  If there was one outfit that defined men's style [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=0.0s)]
*  in the 20th century, it would be the suit and tie. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=3.16s)]
*  And if there was one outfitter who helped pioneer that look, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=6.84s)]
*  it would be Brooks Brothers. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  But workplace fashion has changed a lot [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  since the suit's heyday. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  And analysts say Brooks Brothers wasn't able to keep up [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=16.16s)]
*  with modern men who often wanted styles [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=18.82s)]
*  that were cheaper and more functional. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  The tipping point came when the suit maker was forced [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=23.42s)]
*  to shutter stores during ongoing coronavirus lockdowns. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=25.96s)]
*  And in July, it filed for bankruptcy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=29.12s)]
*  Brooks Brothers is filing for bankruptcy protection. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=31.64s)]
*  It's planning to close about 50 of its 200 stores. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=34.6s)]
*  And that is the sort of decline in the suit. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=37.6s)]
*  People are not wearing pinstripes to work [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=40.8s)]
*  in the same way. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=42.72s)]
*  Here's how the retailer went from the top of menswear [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=43.54s)]
*  to filing for bankruptcy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=46.36s)]
*  The Brooks Brothers brand identity [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=50.52s)]
*  is built around its American roots. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=52.24s)]
*  Brooks Brothers is the oldest American clothing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=54.900000000000006s)]
*  They along the way have had a really outsized impact [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=57.84s)]
*  on American men's fashion in particular, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=61.720000000000006s)]
*  kind of defining what men's style is in America [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  and also having a lot of different cultural touch points. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=67.02000000000001s)]
*  That impact started in 1818 when Henry Sands Brooks [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=70.2s)]
*  opened a men's clothing store in New York City. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  He enlisted the help of his sons [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=77.44s)]
*  and the store was renamed Brooks Brothers. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  The retailer built its high-class reputation early. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=82.42s)]
*  Abraham Lincoln wore a Brooks Brothers overcoat seen here [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=85.68s)]
*  during his second inauguration. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=88.64s)]
*  And the company claims to have dressed [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=90.44000000000001s)]
*  40 out of 45 presidents. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=92.28s)]
*  Heading into the 20th century, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  the company had a pioneering moment in 1896 [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=96.64000000000001s)]
*  when it introduced the button-down collared shirt, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  which would become a staple of professional work attire. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=102.76s)]
*  Brooks Brothers did a really good job [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=105.92000000000002s)]
*  of basically being an innovator [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=107.56s)]
*  and creating styles that were something [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  that men were gonna wanna wear [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=113.72s)]
*  and put into their wardrobe [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=115.36s)]
*  and especially put into the wardrobe day in, day out. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=116.64s)]
*  By the middle of the 20th century, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=119.4s)]
*  the suit became standard uniform for working professionals [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=121.36s)]
*  from Madison Avenue ad executives [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=124.44s)]
*  to middle America salesmen. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=126.28s)]
*  As it grew, the retailer opened US factories [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=128.06s)]
*  and began selling clothes to both men and women. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=130.86s)]
*  The big look for Brooks was this kind of natural-shouldered, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=133.92s)]
*  it was very easy-wearing suit. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=137.36s)]
*  Our touchstone when we talk about this period [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=139.24s)]
*  is always the man in the gray flannel suit. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  What you would see in that movie [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=143.82s)]
*  of a man on the train commuting into work [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=145.18s)]
*  and everyone's wearing a dark gray or dark blue suit, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=148.02s)]
*  and they really helped kind of hammer home [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=151.28s)]
*  that that was how men should be dressing [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=153.38s)]
*  and what men should be wearing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=155.06s)]
*  One of the retailer's designs, the non-iron shirt, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=156.42000000000002s)]
*  was a massive success, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=159.54s)]
*  but showed signs men's fashion [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=161.08s)]
*  was becoming more utilitarian. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=162.66s)]
*  The business began to shift in 1988 [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=165.14s)]
*  when the company was sold [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=167.98s)]
*  to British retailer Marks & Spencer. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=169.18s)]
*  Marks & Spencer tried some things out. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=172.56s)]
*  They tried to update the stores, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=174.2s)]
*  they tried to update the shopping experience, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=176.56s)]
*  they started to change up where things are produced. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=178.9s)]
*  At this point, Brooks's customer base [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=181.48s)]
*  is pretty set in stone. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=183.52s)]
*  They know what the brand offers, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=185.0s)]
*  they rely on the brand for certain items, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=187.4s)]
*  and they are, for lack of a better term, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=189.44s)]
*  a risk-averse consumer. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=191.96s)]
*  But the 1980s are a time where fashion [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=193.98000000000002s)]
*  is changing significantly for men. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=196.18s)]
*  For the Brooks Brothers guy, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=198.44s)]
*  that was a hard thing to stomach. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=199.88s)]
*  Throughout the 90s, the retailer struggled, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=201.56s)]
*  as trends towards casual dressing emerged [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  that even reached the top of the corporate world. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=205.96s)]
*  And in 2001, the company was sold again [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=208.64s)]
*  to another foreign owner, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=211.06s)]
*  this time to Italian businessman Claudio Del Vecchio. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=212.76s)]
*  He has big plans, and a lot of analysts [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=216.24s)]
*  and a lot of people that watch the clothing space [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=218.76s)]
*  have faith in it, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=221.0s)]
*  and they think that maybe he can turn it around. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=222.5s)]
*  He hires the American menswear designer Tom Brown [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=224.8s)]
*  to start Brooks Brothers Black Fleece, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=228.1s)]
*  which is this higher-end, more niche line. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  He also hires Zach Posen, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=232.56s)]
*  who's an American womenswear designer, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=234.34s)]
*  to become the head of design for Brooks Brothers' women's side. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  What's amazing about Brooks Brothers [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  is I don't think there's anywhere else in the market [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=242.24s)]
*  where you can find such high-quality make and fabrication. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=244.84s)]
*  But all the while, Brooks Brothers is having difficulty [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=250.12s)]
*  adapting and adjusting [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=254.92s)]
*  and getting a new consumer in through the door. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=256.64s)]
*  With the rise of Silicon Valley, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=259.64000000000004s)]
*  men's fashion was skewing more casual, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=261.40000000000003s)]
*  as tech CEOs ditched the suit and tie [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=263.72s)]
*  for vests, hoodies, and flannels. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=265.88s)]
*  From 2016 to 2018, the market for suits was shrinking, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=268.32000000000005s)]
*  while other apparel categories, like sportswear, were growing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=272.86s)]
*  So what we see is this real push toward casualization [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=277.06s)]
*  and toward not necessarily simplicity, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  but toward functionality a little bit more [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=284.6s)]
*  and away from the suit [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=287.88s)]
*  and toward maybe the simple plaid shirt [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=290.44s)]
*  that's a little bit more affordable. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=293.38s)]
*  And so they lose this real interest from customers [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  and they really lose a place in the market [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=300.12s)]
*  of being where men go to for their clothing. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=301.8s)]
*  In 2019, Brooks Brothers captured less than 1% of sales [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=304.36s)]
*  for menswear behind sportswear brands [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=308.12s)]
*  like Nike, Under Armour, and Adidas. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=310.48s)]
*  In 2019, with about $1 billion in revenue, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=313.56s)]
*  and 244 stores in the US, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  the retailer began to look for a buyer. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=319.52s)]
*  But coronavirus lockdowns in 2020 [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=322.08s)]
*  forced the retailer to permanently close around 51 stores. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=324.12s)]
*  And the shift to working from home [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=327.91999999999996s)]
*  temporarily dried up the demand for professional attire. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=329.52s)]
*  Guys are just at the point [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=333.2s)]
*  where they just want to be comfortable. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=334.35999999999996s)]
*  And when you're working from home, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=336.46s)]
*  you have the ability to do that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=337.52s)]
*  We hear all the time now [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=339.47999999999996s)]
*  that men have their quote unquote Zoom shirt [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=340.76s)]
*  that they will put on just before they got on the video call [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  and then take off right after [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=346.56s)]
*  and just be sitting in a tee at their desk. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  Brooks Brothers shifted production [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STC4qVm52Ew&t=350.71999999999997s)]
