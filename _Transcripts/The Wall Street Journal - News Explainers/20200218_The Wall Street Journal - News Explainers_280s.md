# How Victoria's Secret Lost Its Grip | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 18, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0)
*  This is the 2018 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=0.0s)]
*  The hour-long nationally televised event [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=5.8s)]
*  has served as a showcase for the brands [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=8.28s)]
*  bras and lingerie since 2001. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=10.32s)]
*  But 2018 was the fashion show's last broadcast. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=13.88s)]
*  The show had suffered several years of declining ratings [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  that coincided with the drastic rise then fall [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=20.86s)]
*  of the stock price of Victoria's Secret's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=23.88s)]
*  parent company, El Brands. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=25.84s)]
*  Here's how the lingerie retailer, angels and all, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=28.88s)]
*  rose to the top of women's fashion [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=31.84s)]
*  and how its fall from grace has created [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=34.26s)]
*  an uncertain future for the company. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=36.36s)]
*  In 1982, El Brands owner Leslie Wexner [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=40.72s)]
*  acquired Victoria's Secret, a small retailer [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=43.78s)]
*  consisting of six stores and a catalog for $1 million. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  Wexner developed many successful retail businesses [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=51.16s)]
*  in the 1980s and 90s. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=54.08s)]
*  He popularized a specialty mall retailer [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=56.64s)]
*  which had tightly focused product lines [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=59.04s)]
*  and carefully designed stores. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  And he took those stores and rolled them out [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  to malls across the country. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=64.58s)]
*  That model really upended the department store model. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=66.16s)]
*  In the mid-90s, Victoria's Secret's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=69.1s)]
*  heavily padded miracle bra, designed to create cleavage, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=71.04s)]
*  was vying for market share with its competitor, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  the Wonder Bra. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  Only Victoria's Secret has the miracle bra. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=78.28s)]
*  Get a miracle bra. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=81.4s)]
*  Victoria's Secret doubled down on ads [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=83.12s)]
*  with provocative TV commercials [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=85.34s)]
*  and launched its first fashion show in 1995. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=87.02000000000001s)]
*  Victoria's Secret tried to define what sexy was [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=91.34s)]
*  and what a sexy woman should look like. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=93.58s)]
*  And you can really see by the ads [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=95.46000000000001s)]
*  that they were pushing a very specific beauty ideal. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=97.06s)]
*  That image was executed by El Brands [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=99.9s)]
*  chief marketing officer, Edward Razik, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  who was put in charge of casting models [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=104.62s)]
*  for the fashion show. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=106.78s)]
*  Throughout the 2000s, Leslie Wexner sold many [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=108.74000000000001s)]
*  of his apparel brands and focused more and more [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=111.42s)]
*  on his lingerie and beauty lines. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=113.86s)]
*  This included launching Pink in 2004, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=116.1s)]
*  a Victoria's Secret spinoff for teens. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=119.0s)]
*  Unlike many other retailers, Victoria's Secret continued [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=121.78s)]
*  to grow after the 2008 recession. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=125.16s)]
*  The retailer opened more stores and sales expanded. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=128.02s)]
*  And El Brands' stock price rose until 2016. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=131.7s)]
*  That's when you really started to see trouble [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=136.5s)]
*  for the company as consumer tastes started to shift. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=138.14s)]
*  Athleisure began to dominate fashion [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=141.26s)]
*  and growth began to slow [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=143.38s)]
*  in Victoria's Secret's bra business. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=144.85999999999999s)]
*  This was driven in part by consumers preferring bralettes, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  bras with no underwire or padding. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=150.98s)]
*  There was a shift in what female consumers wanted [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=153.66s)]
*  from their underwear and what they were willing to pay. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=155.98s)]
*  Many younger women didn't want to pay $60 anymore [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=158.48s)]
*  for a padded bra that they saw on a supermodel. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=161.45999999999998s)]
*  Many of them preferred stuff like more authentic marketing, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=163.98s)]
*  natural looks and bras built for comfort. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=166.54s)]
*  In 2016, Leslie Wexner assumed direct control [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=169.5s)]
*  of Victoria's Secret. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=172.78s)]
*  He eliminated swimwear, stopped mailing out catalogs [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=174.06s)]
*  and doubled down on sports bras. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=176.86s)]
*  By 2018, El Brands' share price had fallen 50%, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=179.5s)]
*  erasing about $14 billion in investors' wealth. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=184.06s)]
*  Victoria's Secret started to appear out of touch [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=188.22s)]
*  with female consumers around the same time. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=190.86s)]
*  A major stumbling block for Victoria's Secret [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=193.82s)]
*  was when Ed Razik told Vogue [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=195.82s)]
*  that he didn't think transgender models [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=197.42000000000002s)]
*  should be cast in the fashion show. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=199.02s)]
*  He was forced to apologize for those remarks [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=200.74s)]
*  and a lot of people called for his resignation immediately. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=203.10000000000002s)]
*  He actually stayed on a while after that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=206.22s)]
*  and eventually resigned in 2019. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=208.34s)]
*  Victoria's Secret's internal culture and management [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  has come under scrutiny as well. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=214.02s)]
*  Ed Razik, after he left Victoria's Secret, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=216.3s)]
*  has faced allegations of harassing models and employees. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=218.98000000000002s)]
*  And Les Wexner has come under fire [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=222.54000000000002s)]
*  for his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=224.66000000000003s)]
*  who was his longtime money manager. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=226.42000000000002s)]
*  Lesley Wexner has said that he cut ties with Epstein [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=228.78s)]
*  more than a decade ago, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=231.94s)]
*  after Epstein was charged with child sex trafficking. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  Independent directors on the El Brands board [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=237.26000000000002s)]
*  responded to the sexual harassment allegations [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  in a statement that said the company had instituted [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=242.62s)]
*  robust anti-harassment policies in recent years [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=245.26000000000002s)]
*  and the company regrets any instance [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=248.82000000000002s)]
*  where we did not achieve this objective [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=251.02s)]
*  of a safe, welcoming and empowering workplace. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=253.26000000000002s)]
*  Razik told the New York Times that the allegations were, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=257.26s)]
*  quote, categorically untrue, misconstrued, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=259.98s)]
*  or taken out of context. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  Consumers have a very particular idea [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=265.62s)]
*  of what Victoria's Secret is. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=267.62s)]
*  It'll be interesting to see whether a brand [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=269.34s)]
*  that's married to such a particular type of marketing [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=271.26s)]
*  can transform itself into anything else. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xe8qimmtt0&t=273.9s)]
