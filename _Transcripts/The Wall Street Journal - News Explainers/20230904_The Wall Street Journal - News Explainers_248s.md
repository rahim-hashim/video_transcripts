# Why Many of China’s College Grads Are Becoming ‘Full-Time Children’ | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k)
*  A record number of young people in China graduated from college this year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=0.0s)]
*  But instead of celebrating, some are marking the milestone on social media by lying down [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=5.84s)]
*  flat on the ground in their graduation gowns, looking dejected and exhausted. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=12.08s)]
*  After studying for years, they're frustrated with the struggle to find decent work as China's [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=18.2s)]
*  youth unemployment rate hits historic highs. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=23.44s)]
*  So for some, the better option for now is to stay at home as so-called full-time children. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=26.88s)]
*  If you have a lot of idle young people who are not employed, it adds pressure on social [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=33.16s)]
*  stability, which is what the government really is concerned about. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=38.04s)]
*  Here's why millions of Chinese graduates are out of work. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=41.72s)]
*  The term full-time children has gone viral on Chinese social media. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=46.64s)]
*  Videos show young people spending time with their parents, cooking and cleaning in exchange [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=51.04s)]
*  for a salary. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=56.16s)]
*  They are choosing to stay at home full-time. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=60.279999999999994s)]
*  They are counting on their parents to continue to support them financially. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=63.48s)]
*  This is what many people are referring to as the lying flat phenomenon in China. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=67.88s)]
*  Lying flat essentially means to resist the intense social pressure to study hard and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=73.58s)]
*  work even harder. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  A record 11.6 million young Chinese graduated from college this year, almost 12 times more [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=82.12s)]
*  than 20 years ago. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=88.92s)]
*  Students have much higher expectations for their job income, their job stability and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=91.08000000000001s)]
*  what they can derive by doing work. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  But the graduates soon found they're competing with thousands of others for only a handful [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=100.28s)]
*  of jobs that match their skills and expectations. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=105.04s)]
*  And youth unemployment hit a record 21.3% in June. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=108.96s)]
*  Joblessness in China increased dramatically in recent years, while other countries such [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=114.36s)]
*  as the US saw a spike in youth unemployment during the pandemic that rapidly fell as restrictions [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=118.96s)]
*  were eased. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=125.16s)]
*  China maintained COVID controls for longer than most countries, keeping its borders closed [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=126.6s)]
*  from 2020 to early 2023. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=131.56s)]
*  Major cities went through extended lockdowns that disrupted production. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=134.52s)]
*  As the economy slowed, so too did hiring. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=139.32000000000002s)]
*  China's youth unemployment rate rose for six consecutive months this year. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=143.12s)]
*  Then in August, the government abruptly announced that it would stop reporting that data, citing [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  plans to revisit the methodology. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=153.10000000000002s)]
*  Analysts say the suspension fits a worrying pattern of haziness around the true state [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=155.8s)]
*  of China's economy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  To address the youth unemployment problem, local governments ordered state-owned companies [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=163.38s)]
*  to hire more graduates. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=168.26s)]
*  They're also pushing young people to take up blue-collared work. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=170.78s)]
*  But that's unappealing for a lot of college graduates. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=174.26s)]
*  A survey from online recruitment platform Zhaoping found that a quarter of this year's [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=177.26s)]
*  graduates want to work in the technology sector, despite the fact that some of China's biggest [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=181.9s)]
*  tech firms had massive layoffs following a regulatory crackdown on the industry. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=186.85999999999999s)]
*  So unless confidence revives in those sectors, young college graduates will likely continue [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=192.34s)]
*  to struggle in terms of what kind of work they're looking forward to do. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=197.18s)]
*  Down the line, having millions of young people out of work will have serious ripple effects [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=202.66s)]
*  for China's society. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=207.58s)]
*  High jobless rate among young people also exacerbates many other structural challenges [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=209.3s)]
*  that China already is dealing with. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=214.56s)]
*  For example, without stable jobs, many people are putting off getting married. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=216.34s)]
*  We don't want to have kids. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=221.9s)]
*  And all these will make China's demographic situation even worse. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=223.34s)]
*  Some a warning of a lost generation. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=229.3s)]
*  It's adding to a long list of challenges for Beijing to boost growth and attract foreign [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=232.02s)]
*  investors as the world's second-largest economy tries to rebuild from the pandemic. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQvNRC4h01k&t=236.62s)]
