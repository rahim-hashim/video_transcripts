# Why Some States Are Struggling to Pay Unemployment Claims | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 05, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644)
*  As coronavirus closures have put businesses on life support, jobless claims have surged. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=0.0s)]
*  In some states, more than 20 percent of the workforce filed claims. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=6.84s)]
*  But in other states, the share is much lower, and experts say the numbers may still underestimate [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=10.56s)]
*  the scope of people who are out of work trying to access the benefit. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=15.16s)]
*  Taking states a while to process benefits as is, and to add in the new pandemic unemployment [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  assistance benefit, the $600 and the 13 additional weeks. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=24.86s)]
*  Here are some of the obstacles holding states up as they try to process the historic number [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=29.12s)]
*  of unemployment claims. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=33.22s)]
*  Challenge number one, technology. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=36.88s)]
*  In some states, old technology has slowed down the process. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  In mid-March, Connecticut residents began to overload the state Labor Department's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=42.68s)]
*  website with claims. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=46.2s)]
*  The portal could only handle about 8,000 benefit applications at a time. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=48.1s)]
*  Once the problem was resolved, claims increased sharply. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=52.2s)]
*  A spokesperson from Connecticut's Labor Department said that before the spike in claims, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=55.84s)]
*  the state was already in the final stages of moving to the cloud. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=59.56s)]
*  Connecticut is far from the only state with technology issues. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=63.64s)]
*  The New York State Department of Labor had to add computer servers to address the flood of claims. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=66.80000000000001s)]
*  The department's unemployment claims hotline received 8.2 million calls in the last week [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=72.12s)]
*  of March, compared with 50,000 in a typical week. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=76.88s)]
*  The website recorded 3.4 million visits, compared with 350,000 normally. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=81.04s)]
*  Only 16 states have upgraded off of their 1970s COBOL mainframes entirely. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=86.64s)]
*  Then there are a few states who have upgraded their benefit system. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=93.12s)]
*  Four states have upgraded their benefit system. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=96.0s)]
*  Three states have upgraded their tax system. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  But for the most part, states are still running on pretty old technology. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=100.12s)]
*  Challenge number two, experience. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  Some states also lack experience in setting up the systems for the new unemployment funds. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=108.18s)]
*  According to Evermore, some elements of the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Program are [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=113.34s)]
*  based on the disaster program. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=117.94000000000001s)]
*  Disaster unemployment assistance has been around since 1974. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=120.18s)]
*  Some states are used to using the system. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=123.7s)]
*  States that have a lot of natural disasters have implemented disaster unemployment assistance [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=125.74000000000001s)]
*  before. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=130.98000000000002s)]
*  States like Florida, Louisiana, they get hit with a lot of hurricanes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=131.98000000000002s)]
*  So the Carolinas, right? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=137.06s)]
*  Texas. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=139.7s)]
*  But some states haven't had a lot of natural disasters. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=140.7s)]
*  Arizona, for example, hasn't had a natural disaster declaration since 1983. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=143.78s)]
*  And coincidentally, my colleague just found out that they won't have their computers [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=148.54s)]
*  up and running to process these benefits for 18 weeks. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=152.7s)]
*  Challenge number three, financial pressure. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=156.34s)]
*  Some states, like Massachusetts, are experiencing additional financial pressures. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=159.1s)]
*  The new federal unemployment programs make up to 39 weeks of unemployment insurance available [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=163.7s)]
*  to previously uncovered groups like gig workers. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=168.85999999999999s)]
*  The federal government pays an additional $600 per week for each successful claim through [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=171.7s)]
*  July 31st. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  But states are still on the hook for standard unemployment payments. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=177.94s)]
*  Those payments range from $213 a week in Mississippi to about $550 a week in Massachusetts. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=182.06s)]
*  The average weekly benefit amount in the United States is about $370 a week. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=188.45999999999998s)]
*  The average weekly wage in the United States is around $970. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=193.18s)]
*  So that $600 represents that gap to get workers to 100 percent. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=197.54000000000002s)]
*  The standard benefits are paid by state unemployment trust funds. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=202.74s)]
*  And some states have drawn down their trust fund balances sharply between February and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  April. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=211.26000000000002s)]
*  For example, Massachusetts spent more than half of its unemployment trust fund balance [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=212.26000000000002s)]
*  in that period. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=216.78s)]
*  A spokesman for the Massachusetts Labor Department said the state is committed to making sure [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=217.78s)]
*  workers continue to receive the benefits they deserve. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=222.74s)]
*  Several states have burned through their cash and may seek additional loans from the federal [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=226.66s)]
*  government to stay afloat. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=230.82000000000002s)]
*  More than 20 states aren't positioned to pay out enough in unemployment benefits in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=232.58s)]
*  the event of a recession, according to the Journal's analysis of Labor Department data. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZ7ePB8644&t=236.42000000000002s)]
