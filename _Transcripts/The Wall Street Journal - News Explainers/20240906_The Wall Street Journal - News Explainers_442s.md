# Harris vs. Trump: Debate-Winning Tactics, Explained by a Champion Coach | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs)
*  She's not a smart person. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=0.0s)]
*  She doesn't want to debate. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=1.6s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=5.68s)]
*  finally face off in a debate on September 10th. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=9.32s)]
*  I think it would be a disappointing debate if Kamala Harris can't do the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=12.36s)]
*  one thing that Joe Biden couldn't do and that Hillary Clinton couldn't do, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  which was grab the vibes. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=19.28s)]
*  Here's a look at the debate tactics most used by Harris and Trump and what a [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=21.44s)]
*  champion debate coach thinks they need to do to win. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Gish Gallup is a tactic of argumentation where instead of just arguing one or [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=30.56s)]
*  two things, you argue several items because it's harder for your opponents [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=35.6s)]
*  to answer them. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=40.6s)]
*  This is Todd Graham. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=41.84s)]
*  He's coached college debate teams to five national championships, and he's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=43.28s)]
*  talking about a technique Trump frequently uses called Gish Gallup. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=47.2s)]
*  It's considered a fallacy of argumentation because you're just throwing a [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=51.72s)]
*  lot of things up against the wall to see what sticks, but you're not [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  really defending any of those things. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  We've built the greatest economy in history. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=59.08s)]
*  The dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of dealmaking. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=61.0s)]
*  I had the best environmental numbers ever. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=64.08s)]
*  And so that enables you to do a little bit more of Gish Gallup because you're [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=67.36s)]
*  not talking about specific policies. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=70.52s)]
*  Specific policies take time to get into. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=72.16s)]
*  Whether Trump uses it intentionally or not, he's very good at it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=74.68s)]
*  Are Putin's terms acceptable to you? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=78.88s)]
*  First of all, our veterans and our soldiers can't stand this guy. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  And they like me more than just about any of them. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=86.6s)]
*  As far as Russia and Ukraine, if we had a real president, a lot of people are [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  dead right now, much more than people know. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you what happened. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=98.12s)]
*  He was so bad with Afghanistan. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=98.92s)]
*  He should have fired those generals. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=101.12s)]
*  Israel would have never been invaded. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=103.12s)]
*  The whole world is blowing up under him. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  He had a very short answer to the question that wasn't specific, but then [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=108.44000000000001s)]
*  talked about things that were similar to the question and got a lot of criticisms [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=111.56s)]
*  of his opponent out. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=116.44000000000001s)]
*  So I thought that was a very successful use of it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=117.16s)]
*  In his reply, Biden tries to address every element of Trump's Gish Gallup. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  Never heard so much malarkey in my whole life. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  Look, the fact of the matter is that we're in a situation where let's take the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=126.0s)]
*  last point first. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=128.92s)]
*  He's fallen into Trump's trap. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=129.88s)]
*  When you hear a Gish Gallup like this from Trump, you just think, oh, how dare [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  he say that about me? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=134.24s)]
*  I'm going to answer that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=135.16s)]
*  Well, he's how dare they said about four things. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=136.16s)]
*  You're never going to get through all of those. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=139.16s)]
*  Iran attacked American troops. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=141.12s)]
*  We got over 100,000 Americans and others out of Afghanistan during that airlift. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=143.44s)]
*  And that's exactly what Trump did to encourage him. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  Do whatever you want. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  And he went in. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  They've lost thousands and thousands of troops, 500,000 troops. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  One of the problems debaters have, this is all the way from middle school, high [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=160.12s)]
*  school to college, to political debaters and presidential debaters. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=164.92s)]
*  They do not like letting things go unanswered. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=168.6s)]
*  And you have to train them and train them. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=171.88s)]
*  Let it go. Let it go. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=173.88s)]
*  To combat Gish Gallup, Graham says organization and focus are key. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=175.64s)]
*  OK, Donald, I know you're into big diversion tonight. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=180.2s)]
*  Anything to avoid talking about your campaign. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=183.6s)]
*  If I'm Kamala Harris, I would be reminding everyone what the question is. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=186.16s)]
*  The question was this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=190.12s)]
*  Here's my answer. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=191.12s)]
*  September 10th will be Kamala Harris's first one-on-one presidential debate. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  Graham says her style reflects that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=199.04s)]
*  I think it is currently emerging. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=201.23999999999998s)]
*  Four years ago, her style was very laid back. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=202.88s)]
*  When she debated Mike Pence, she had a little bit more assertiveness and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=205.48s)]
*  aggressiveness. I think that's what she's building on now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=208.44s)]
*  Being assertive is a tactic she used in the Senate, where she was known for [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=211.68s)]
*  sharp, direct questioning. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=215.23999999999998s)]
*  Can you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  about the male body? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  They have not asked me to open an investigation. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=227.6s)]
*  Perhaps they've suggested. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=230.68s)]
*  I don't know. I wouldn't say suggest. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  Hinted. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=233.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  Inferred. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=235.72s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=239.68s)]
*  It's a tactic she brought to the debate stage in the 2020 election cycle. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  Let's be really clear. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=244.4s)]
*  In our America, no one should have to work more than one job to have a roof [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=245.36s)]
*  over their head and food on the table. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  If you love someone who has a preexisting condition, they're coming for you. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=252.12s)]
*  If you are under the age of 26 on your parents' coverage, they're coming for you. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=256.64s)]
*  Old school, if women came across as as assertive as a man, they wouldn't be [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=261.32s)]
*  seen as assertive. They were seen as aggressive. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=265.91999999999996s)]
*  New school is we're much more apt to be like, no, you have a right to be as [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=267.91999999999996s)]
*  upset as anyone else. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=272.52s)]
*  So I don't think we have to keep playing the Hillary Clinton game, which is she [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=273.44s)]
*  had to be perfect. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  It's conceivable that somebody. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  Sir, I have just a few. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=279.84s)]
*  You let me qualify. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=281.2s)]
*  If I don't qualify, you'll accuse me of lying. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=282.32s)]
*  So I need to be correct as best I can. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=285.88s)]
*  I do want you to be honest. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=287.84s)]
*  I'm not able to be rushed this fast. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=288.6s)]
*  It makes me nervous. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=291.84s)]
*  Are you aware of any communications with other Trump campaign officials and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=293.08s)]
*  associates that they had with Russian officials or any Russian nationals? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=297.52s)]
*  I don't recall that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=302.76s)]
*  She's really found her rhythm and who she is, but she does not like being interrupted. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=305.0s)]
*  Well, let's go ahead. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=311.68s)]
*  No, but Susan, this is important. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=312.48s)]
*  And I want to add that Mr. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=314.16s)]
*  Vice President, I'm speaking. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=315.52s)]
*  I have to. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=316.6s)]
*  I'm speaking. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=317.0s)]
*  When she was interrupted by Pence, she would just say, Mr. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=317.88s)]
*  Vice President, I'm speaking. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=320.16s)]
*  But you can only say that so many times if your opponent chooses to keep [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=321.4s)]
*  interrupting you. And after you've said it two or three times, it loses its [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=324.48s)]
*  intensity. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=327.32s)]
*  One way to avoid interruptions is by muting microphones. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=330.36s)]
*  In Trump's June debate with Biden, the microphone was only live when it was [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=334.08s)]
*  that participant's turn to speak. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=337.8s)]
*  ABC News, which is hosting the September 10th debate, said they will [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=339.96s)]
*  follow the same rule. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=343.4s)]
*  Most debaters will want to interrupt once or twice. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=345.08s)]
*  So when it was Mitt Romney debating against Barack Obama, they might have [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=347.2s)]
*  interrupted once or twice. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=350.56s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=351.76s)]
*  Mr. President, I'm still speaking. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=354.2s)]
*  That's fairly normal. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=355.48s)]
*  We didn't have to make rules about that in debate. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=356.8s)]
*  But when Trump came along, and you remember the Republican primary debates [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=359.12s)]
*  when they would have 10 people on stage and it was just chaos, great [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=362.28s)]
*  television, but completely chaotic. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=365.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=367.76s)]
*  And so that's what we're trying to get away from. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=367.96000000000004s)]
*  I think the muted microphone is going to work better for both sides. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  Are you ready to let Kamala Harris, our next president, come on stage? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=374.16s)]
*  After President Biden dropped out of the race in the aftermath of his June [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=379.12s)]
*  debate against Trump, all eyes will be on how Trump and Harris perform on [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=382.8s)]
*  September 10th. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=386.68s)]
*  There are many people who are just looking for the feels. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  They want to see how the candidate feels, how it feels to be supportive of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=390.56s)]
*  that candidate. Trump, everybody always says, well, he needs to be more [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=393.20000000000005s)]
*  specific. He's not going to get into a lot of specifics, but he could just [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=395.72s)]
*  do a little bit more, right? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=398.52s)]
*  He knows he's going to say that Harris and Biden have been terrible on the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  economy. So just pick one issue of the economy, whether it's inflation, etc., [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=403.32s)]
*  and go a little deeper on that is all I'm asking. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=407.08s)]
*  If Kamala Harris doesn't come away from this debate with people going, that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=409.36s)]
*  was awesome, then she probably didn't do what she wanted to do. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=412.72s)]
*  Her answers are going to be fine. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=415.76s)]
*  That's not the problem. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  The problem is, is she going to get people motivated? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=418.4s)]
*  I think she can be excellent if she keeps that calm demeanor, but still is [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=420.68s)]
*  aggressive when she needs to. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=423.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FDFPZgdtHs&t=425.68s)]
