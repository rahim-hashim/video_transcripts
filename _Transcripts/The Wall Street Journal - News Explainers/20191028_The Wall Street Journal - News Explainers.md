# Boeing vs. Airbus Why Aviation’s Biggest Rivalry Is in Flux  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 28, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc)
*  This is Boeing's 737 MAX, and this is its rival, the Airbus A320neo. These planes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=0.0s)]
*  are at the center of the biggest rivalry in the aviation industry. They're both [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=9.72s)]
*  competing for the same market and are mostly used on relatively short trips [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=15.52s)]
*  like Boston to Miami or London to Madrid. Now, also thanks to the A320neo, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=19.66s)]
*  Airbus has had a solid year. The airliner has established itself as a [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=26.24s)]
*  best-seller since it first made its commercial flight in 2016. Boeing, on the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=31.159999999999997s)]
*  other hand, has had a very rough year. The 737 MAX, which started flying [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=36.04s)]
*  commercially in 2017, was supposed to strengthen Boeing's position as the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=41.48s)]
*  world's largest plane maker. Instead, it became a symbol of one of the worst [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=46.04s)]
*  crises in the company's history. What does this all mean for the two companies [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=50.56s)]
*  that secure 99% of the world's large plane orders? It's really, you know, two old [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=55.12s)]
*  competitors battling it out in the ring and they say there's no there's no room [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=59.84s)]
*  in this ring for anybody else. This chart shows deliveries for Boeing and Airbus [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=65.04s)]
*  since the start of 2019. You'll see Boeing's total deliveries start to fall [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=69.72s)]
*  after the March grounding of 737 MAX jets. And as it stands now, there's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=74.72s)]
*  virtually no way Boeing can deliver more planes than Airbus this year. But, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  Airbus might not hold the top spot for long. This will bounce back and forward [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=84.8s)]
*  between the two companies depending on on the product they're selling, on the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  number of the number of airlines that they can get on board. It really is [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=92.64s)]
*  something you can sort of watch this go back and forward like a tide coming out [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  and tide going in. So what's behind this latest power shift in the aviation [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=100.68s)]
*  world? What's happening with Boeing 737 MAX is a good place to start. The crash [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=105.2s)]
*  into the ocean. A Lion Air Boeing 737. A devastating scene tonight. An Ethiopian [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  Airlines jet with 157 people on board has crashed. After two deadly crashes in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=117.08000000000001s)]
*  five months, Boeing 737 MAX became the subject of international investigations, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=123.72s)]
*  public scrutiny, a flood of lawsuits and some high profile shakeups in the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  company's leadership. We're going to be issuing an emergency order of prohibition [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=134.08s)]
*  to ground all flights of the 737 MAX 8 and the 737 MAX 9. The MAX situation [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=139.2s)]
*  has raised concerns about whether Boeing has done enough to make sure its [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=150.0s)]
*  planes are safe to fly. Safety is our responsibility. We own it and the work of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=153.44s)]
*  our team will make the 737 MAX one of the safest airplanes ever to fly. The [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  company's business has taken a hit. Many of those 737 MAXs are just sitting in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=167.68s)]
*  Boeing facilities and other storage areas around the world. As of October, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  the MAX crisis had already cost Boeing $9 billion and wiped more than $40 [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  billion off its market value. As the situation drags on, Boeing has tried to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  boost confidence, reiterating that safety is its top priority. In a September press [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=189.56s)]
*  release, CEO Dennis Mullenberg said that ensuring the safety of the flying [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=195.32s)]
*  public, pilots and crew is Boeing's top priority as they work to return the 737 [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=200.04s)]
*  MAX to service. Mullenberg was stripped of his chairmanship on October 11, but he [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=205.8s)]
*  is still the CEO. So does this mean Airbus is benefiting from the 737 MAX's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=211.08s)]
*  woes? Not necessarily. Buying an airliner is not like going down to your show, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=218.56s)]
*  your local car showroom and saying, I don't like a Ford, I'll pop down to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=223.96s)]
*  Chevy and see what they've got. You really are in a list. You're in a queue [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=227.48s)]
*  that's got a line that's going to stretch back to maybe even three years [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=231.64s)]
*  if it's a really popular airplane. Even without the MAX situation, Airbus was [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=234.96s)]
*  already on track to overtake Boeing's deliveries. Now, it just appears to be [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  happening a little sooner than expected. And that's thanks in part to the A320 [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  Airbus has gone from producing 50 a month in 2017 to 60 the next year, with [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=250.44s)]
*  the CEO saying demand could possibly support more than 70 a month in the near [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=255.88s)]
*  future. But it's not all about these two planes. Airbus and Boeing make other [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=260.24s)]
*  models, and they're facing challenges there too. Airbus is phasing out its A380 [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=265.32s)]
*  model, which hasn't been selling well. But production on it was already so low, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=270.96s)]
*  it's not having much of an impact on the company's overall output. Boeing has [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=275.96s)]
*  repeatedly had to push back the first test flight of its 777X due to production [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=280.96s)]
*  problems. In a September press release, Boeing said it doesn't expect further [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=286.0s)]
*  delays and, quote, we remain fully focused on safety as our highest [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=290.6s)]
*  priority as we subject the 777X to a rigorous test program prior to first [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=295.24s)]
*  flight. Not that delays on new planes are unusual. Both Boeing and Airbus have [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  faced production problems before. It's just really bad timing for Boeing to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=305.44s)]
*  take on another set of issues right now. The company is still trying to get its [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=309.76s)]
*  737 MAX back in the air after more than seven months on the ground. And that's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=313.84s)]
*  just the planes. The aviation giants have a lot of other factors to think [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=319.0s)]
*  about too, like geopolitics and tariffs. In October, the WTO said the US can [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=323.32s)]
*  slap $7.5 billion worth of tariffs on EU-produced goods because of the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=330.44s)]
*  subsidies Airbus gets from the EU. In a statement, Airbus said the only way to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=335.6s)]
*  prevent negative effects of the tariffs is for the US and EU to negotiate a [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=340.76s)]
*  settlement. There's also Brexit, oil prices, trade wars, regulation, and of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=345.52s)]
*  course, competition. Supported by the Chinese government, Chinese-made planes [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=350.8s)]
*  may soon hit the market, though it could take years for the Chinese company known [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=355.76s)]
*  as Comac to scale up production. The competition from China is maybe 10 [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=360.32s)]
*  years away from becoming significant. As air travel continues to rise and both [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=367.08s)]
*  companies anticipate growth in the coming years, whatever happens with these [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=372.0s)]
*  planes will impact how millions of people move across the world. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7d__yk0Phc&t=375.64s)]
