# Why NATO Countries Say Russia Is Weaponizing Migrants | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y)
*  These asylum seekers are waiting in temperatures as low as minus 13 degrees to try and cross from Russia into Finland. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=0.0s)]
*  This video was filmed near a remote checkpoint, located over 185 miles north of the Arctic Circle, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=8.76s)]
*  and more than 30 miles from the nearest Finnish town. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=16.12s)]
*  It's not a typical migration route, yet similar videos showing hundreds of people making unusual journeys to Finland from Russia [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=19.88s)]
*  have popped up along their 830 mile long border. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=28.32s)]
*  The Finnish authorities are saying Moscow must be behind this. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=32.32s)]
*  Here's how Finland says Russia and its allies are using migration as a political weapon. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=36.56s)]
*  NGOs believe there is evidence that migrants are being supported to reach Finland's borders. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=44.8s)]
*  In the past, it was very difficult for migrants to actually travel to the border without proper documentation or visas. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=50.0s)]
*  And now apparently that is not the case. That kind of has changed. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=57.72s)]
*  Finnish aid groups told the journal that it is very unlikely that migrants could travel the long distances to the border crossings without help. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=62.0s)]
*  Videos and photos showed people arriving at checkpoints by foot or using bicycles. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=70.2s)]
*  There are eight official border crossings between Finland and Russia. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=75.84s)]
*  In the first six months of 2023, less than 100 people crossed the border. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  But that increased to thousands of asylum seekers by the end of the year. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=84.88s)]
*  Helsinki has described their influx from Russia as an act of hybrid warfare. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  Finnish researchers say that is a tactic that is largely used to target political institutions and influence public opinion. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=94.44s)]
*  Migration right now is a hot button topic all over the West. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  And it's an issue that gets populations really concerned and anxious. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=105.88s)]
*  That is actually a plus, a positive for the Kremlin because Putin has shown in the past that he very much wants to destabilise these liberal democracies. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=109.92s)]
*  Helsinki's government believes that it is being targeted by Russia in retaliation for joining NATO. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=121.48s)]
*  When Finland joined the Western Military Alliance in 2023, NATO's frontier with Russia doubled. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=127.36s)]
*  Russia wants to show Finland that, you know, we can make trouble for you. We are your neighbour. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=132.88s)]
*  We didn't want you to join NATO, but you have and you're going to have to put up with us. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=138.4s)]
*  The Kremlin has denied orchestrating waves of migration to its Western neighbour, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=144.12s)]
*  but said that Finland's ascension into NATO meant Moscow would have to take any countermeasures to ensure Russia's security. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  Russian authorities didn't respond to a request for comment. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=157.24s)]
*  Help, oh no, please. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=161.52s)]
*  Finland isn't the first NATO member to say Moscow weaponises migration. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=163.4s)]
*  Russia's close ally, Belarus, has also been accused by European leaders of creating an artificial migration crisis on its shared borders with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=168.16s)]
*  This happened in 2021, where there was a surge of migrants going via Belarus to NATO countries. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  And there was a lot of controversy surrounding this because the Poles were accused of mistreating migrants. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=188.24s)]
*  And so that also causes tension between allies. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=195.68s)]
*  The Institute for the Study of War said this was enabled or possibly directly controlled by the Kremlin. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=200.24s)]
*  European leaders said Belarus was flying in migrants from countries including Iraq and Syria [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=206.88s)]
*  and pushing them across the border in a bid to destabilise the bloc, something Minsk has denied. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=212.44s)]
*  Finland has kept its border crossings with Russia shut since late November. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  This slowed the flow of migrants through the winter. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=225.04s)]
*  Yet NGOs believe more people will attempt to cross in spring, especially if checkpoints reopen. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=228.0s)]
*  Finnish authorities say Russia will continue to be a security threat. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=234.16s)]
*  We do not have a political relationship right now with Russia. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=238.92s)]
*  And I don't see that improving in the near future. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  Helsinki believes that thousands of migrants are staying close to the border, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=249.44s)]
*  waiting for a chance to cross into Finland. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl6fCxc15Y&t=254.04s)]
