Video Description: Elon Musk’s SpaceX had hoped to blast off its Starship vehicle on its inaugural test flight Monday, but ended up scrubbing the mission due to a “frozen pressure valve.” Musk himself has sought to lower expectations for the first launch attempt.

WSJ’s Micah Maidenberg explains the challenges Musk’s company faces getting Starship off — and back on — the ground.

# Starship Launch What Challenges Does Elon Musk’s SpaceX Face?  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs)
*  SpaceX's Starship has experienced more than a few crashes or explosions during uncrewed suborbital testing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=0.0s)]
*  Starship! [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=10.46s)]
*  Some more dramatic than others. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=11.46s)]
*  No! [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=13.68s)]
*  On Monday, SpaceX ended up pushing off the first major flight of both stages of Starship, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=15.38s)]
*  due to what CEO Elon Musk called a frozen pressure valve. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=20.72s)]
*  We are going to stop the launch for today. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  The road for testing and verifying that Starship can be operated and used the way SpaceX has set out to use it is long and hard. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=28.4s)]
*  Oh, got it! [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=38.9s)]
*  Here are some of the challenges SpaceX faces getting its biggest and most powerful rocket off of and back on the ground. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=40.44s)]
*  SpaceX has been developing Starship over the last several years, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=50.54s)]
*  aiming to create a reusable rocket to one day handle ambitious crewed missions to deep space. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=54.16s)]
*  The rocket is made up of a 226-foot-tall booster called Super Heavy that would power a 164-foot-tall spacecraft also called Starship. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  Super Heavy, the booster with the Starship spacecraft docked on top of it, that's never flown before, this is all brand new. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=69.22s)]
*  Musk has sought to temper expectations, telling listeners during a Twitter discussion that the company faces serious challenges pulling off the operation. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=76.88000000000001s)]
*  Musk has pointed to Starship's engines as among his top concerns going into the flight attempt, at one point comparing them to grenades. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=87.44s)]
*  The engines, called Raptors, were designed in-house at SpaceX. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=95.16s)]
*  33 are installed on the vehicle's booster. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  The power that SpaceX has tried to build into the Super Heavy booster creates relatively more risk than, say, a smaller rocket with lesser engines that aren't designed to offer as much thrust, as much power to get to space. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=102.08s)]
*  Former employees have said risk-taking is encouraged at the company to gain data to make improvements, so long as that doesn't create safety risks. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=119.52s)]
*  The goal isn't to simply blow stuff up, the goal is to try to hit milestones, deal with anomalies and problems that may emerge, and make the vehicle better quickly. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=128.24s)]
*  Starship heading back to the lander zone. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  SpaceX has also successfully landed the Starship spacecraft. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=143.56s)]
*  On its fifth attempt, it landed back on its pad after climbing as high as 6.2 miles during a six-minute flight in 2021. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=147.36s)]
*  If all goes to SpaceX's plan, the Starship spacecraft would fly around 90 minutes during the flight test after it separates from the booster. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  The booster would then land in the Gulf of Mexico while the ship would land in the Pacific Ocean. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=163.84s)]
*  But it will need to undergo some stress tests to get to that point. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=168.6s)]
*  If they're able to blast the rocket off, a minute after that, the vehicle will experience what's called Max-Q. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=172.64s)]
*  It's basically the moment where there's the peak amount of mechanical stress on the rocket. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=181.76s)]
*  If they get through that and the Starship spacecraft is able to separate and begin flying on its own, that's arguably the second big milestone in the mission. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-Pi0bMzMs&t=188.44s)]
