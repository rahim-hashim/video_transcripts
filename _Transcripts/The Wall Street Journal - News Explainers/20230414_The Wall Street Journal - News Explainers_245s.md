# Pentagon Leak: How Classified Documents Are (Supposed to Be) Handled | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE)
*  21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Jashara was arrested Thursday after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=0.0s)]
*  Dozens of secret briefing slides for hundreds of top officials [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=5.82s)]
*  Ended up on a chat app for gamers [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=8.94s)]
*  Battle plans and information related to the war in Ukraine [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  Revealing U.S. spying on adversaries, including Russia and China, but also on U.S. allies and partners [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=14.72s)]
*  The Pentagon calls it a very serious risk to national security [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=20.22s)]
*  The investigation and arrest have raised questions about how the government handles state secrets [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  This is about how we protect and safeguard classified information [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=29.76s)]
*  And as I highlighted, we do have strict protocols in place [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=33.68s)]
*  So let's look at those protocols, some of which led investigators to Tashara [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  And how classified documents are supposed to be handled [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=42.02s)]
*  There are three levels of classification, confidential, secret, and top secret [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=46.74s)]
*  Each indicates how damaging the information would be to national security if it were leaked [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=51.660000000000004s)]
*  From damaging to exceptionally grave [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=56.540000000000006s)]
*  This classification is printed on the top of documents in addition to any extra designation [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=59.44s)]
*  Like SI, which stands for Special Intelligence [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=64.8s)]
*  Information gained from monitoring foreign communications [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=68.56s)]
*  Some of the printed documents allegedly photographed and posted by Tashara appear marked with SI [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=72.3s)]
*  And other sensitive classifications [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=78.12s)]
*  Classified documents, especially the SI ones, can usually only be accessed in sensitive [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=80.48s)]
*  compartmented information facilities, or SCIFs, by people who were granted that level of clearance [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=86.16s)]
*  SCIFs are secure rooms, think the White House Situation Room, where information can be accessed [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=93.44s)]
*  and discussed securely [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=99.32s)]
*  There's no cell phones, there's no even smart devices such as Fitbits or Apple Watches allowed [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=101.44s)]
*  Nothing technical that could allow for the extraction of the information [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=106.84s)]
*  They can be rooms like these at the Capitol, where senators and House members must go to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=110.88s)]
*  view FBI investigations and other classified reports [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=115.22s)]
*  They can be fashioned in hotel rooms or out in fields [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=119.1s)]
*  Or they can make up larger areas inside an entire building [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=122.62s)]
*  My office in the last three years, I was chief of intelligence for the FBI, was a SCIF [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  But they all follow the same protocols [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=132.06s)]
*  And because the sensitive information can only be accessed in a SCIF, it can also only [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=135.06s)]
*  be printed in a SCIF [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=140.64s)]
*  Intelligence experts say there's a technical footprint that begins here [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=142.60000000000002s)]
*  Government printers keep detailed logs of what is printed and by who [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  And some of these documents, people familiar with the matter said, contain invisible or [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=151.56s)]
*  digital markings too [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=156.0s)]
*  You're printing for a specific purpose [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=157.68s)]
*  You would only print the number of copies for the folks that would have access to this [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  When returned, it's put into, generally into a burn bag and then shipped off to an incinerator [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  that's going to destroy that information [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=167.68s)]
*  It's in this trail that often identifies leakers [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=171.04s)]
*  In 2017, Reality Winner, a translator contractor for the National Security Agency who leaked [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=174.6s)]
*  documents she printed, was quickly identified by tracing the printer's records [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=180.17999999999998s)]
*  Experts at schools say this process is secure and is good at identifying leaks, but to prevent [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=185.27999999999997s)]
*  them in the first place, it relies on trusting the people who are involved at each step of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  this process [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=196.56s)]
*  Well, there's always going to be human trust involved in the process [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=197.56s)]
*  The procedures that were violated, who knew about them, what security protocols were, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=200.84s)]
*  and where this information was accessed will all be reviewed with likely changes coming [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=205.44s)]
*  for the Pentagon, potentially others [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=210.08s)]
*  But you're always going to have a human aspect to this because that's what the business is about [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=212.68s)]
*  It's about individuals being able to access the information [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=218.24s)]
*  According to the indictment, Teixeira was identified through his activities online and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=221.6s)]
*  through this security process, his searches on classified networks [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=226.14s)]
*  It's unclear what changes may come to security protocols or to the clearance of who gets [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=231.66s)]
*  to view these materials in the wake of Teixeira's arrest [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JtUz1ePkE&t=236.7s)]
