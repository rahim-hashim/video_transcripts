# Kanye West Offers to Buy Parler: What's Behind the Conservative Social Media Trend? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU)
*  Big tech must not censor the voices of the American people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=0.0s)]
*  Censor what you say and think. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=3.98s)]
*  Twitter, which will just randomly silence somebody a week after they tweet something. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=5.82s)]
*  Amid the debate over free speech on the internet, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=10.48s)]
*  alternative social media apps have surged in popularity. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=13.22s)]
*  Truth Social, the Twitter-like platform launched by former President Donald Trump, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=16.48s)]
*  was the most downloaded free iPhone app earlier this year. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=20.54s)]
*  Now, Kanye West, who goes by Ye, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=23.72s)]
*  may be in the mix with the deal to buy the social media network Parler. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=26.12s)]
*  This comes after Twitter banned him, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=29.94s)]
*  and amid adidas and Gap parting ways with the rapper following weeks of erratic behavior and anti-Semitic comments. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=31.76s)]
*  So what could West's involvement mean for the site? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=38.3s)]
*  And how does it fit into this growing universe of alternative social media? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=41.1s)]
*  Launched in 2018, Parler attracted millions of users by pitching itself as a free-speech Twitter alternative. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=46.42s)]
*  Prominent conservative donor Rebecca Mercer is among the company's financial backers, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=52.82s)]
*  according to Parler's former CEO, John Matz. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=56.7s)]
*  This platform and others like it tend to attract people who want to speak their minds very freely [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=59.42s)]
*  and may post content that's considered offensive language that wouldn't be allowed on more mainstream platforms. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=65.18s)]
*  Several of its users have been banned by other large social networks. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=72.58s)]
*  This includes Alex Jones, a far-right talk show host and conspiracy theorist, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=76.38s)]
*  as well as supporters of the Proud Boys, the group that helped lead the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=80.46000000000001s)]
*  In early 2021, Apple, Amazon and Google kicked Parler off their app stores, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=85.78s)]
*  after the site hosted calls for violence around the time of the January 6 riot at the Capitol. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=90.33999999999999s)]
*  Essentially, Parler was knocked off the Internet. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=95.02s)]
*  So it was not operating as an app and it wasn't operating as a website either. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=98.33999999999999s)]
*  Apple and Google later restored the site to their app stores, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  but Parler has struggled to maintain a large user base since. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=105.17999999999999s)]
*  In October, the site's parent company, Parliament Technologies, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=108.69999999999999s)]
*  said it agreed to a deal in principle with West to buy the platform for undisclosed terms. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=111.82000000000001s)]
*  This happened shortly after Mr. West was locked out of Twitter and Instagram for posting anti-Semitic content. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=116.62s)]
*  In owning his own social media platform, he would have the freedom to post the kind of content that might not be allowed on other platforms. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=122.62s)]
*  West could not immediately be reached for comment. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=132.3s)]
*  But in a press statement disclosed by Parliament Technologies, he said, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=134.7s)]
*  We have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=141.78s)]
*  Parler is just one of the social media networks that have emerged with promises of looser moderation policies. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=145.02s)]
*  Sites like Bitchshoot and Gab also bill themselves as havens for free speech and alternatives to mainstream media. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=150.42000000000002s)]
*  They came to be as a way to give users the opportunity to speak more freely. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=156.66s)]
*  On the other hand, that sometimes means allowing people to post content that large groups of people might find offensive, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=162.58s)]
*  that might be considered anti-Semitic or just racist. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=168.5s)]
*  Some of these alternative social media sites have also become hotbeds for conspiracy theories and misinformation, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=173.74s)]
*  according to audits of the websites from the Pew Research Center. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=179.3s)]
*  Social media apps like Gab, 8chan, Parler have come under fire for allowing their users to post content that's considered offensive or harmful, dangerous, inciting violence. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=182.34s)]
*  The founder of 8chan could not be reached for comment. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=196.73999999999998s)]
*  A spokesperson for Parler said, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  Conspiracy theory and misinformation are terms used to undercut those platforms, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=201.61999999999998s)]
*  daring to remind people that they have the right to speak freely. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=206.38s)]
*  In a statement, Bitchshoot said, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=210.06s)]
*  Can freedom be real when your silence is required? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=211.61999999999998s)]
*  And added that it supports West. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=214.22s)]
*  Gab, another alternative to Facebook and Twitter, was linked to a 2018 mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=217.01999999999998s)]
*  The shooter had a history of posting anti-Semitic speech on the platform. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=223.5s)]
*  Gab's CEO said the platform cooperates with law enforcement to ensure that anyone who would abuse our site, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=227.26000000000002s)]
*  harm anyone or make terroristic threats is brought to justice. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=232.70000000000002s)]
*  The law says that social media companies aren't responsible for the content its users post. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=236.58s)]
*  Some of these platforms are also increasingly backed by prominent conservatives. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump launched his own social network, called Truth Social, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=247.34s)]
*  after Twitter barred him from the platform following the January 6 attack at the Capitol. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=251.46s)]
*  Google recently approved Truth Social for distribution in its mobile app store, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=255.9s)]
*  opening a new potential customer base for the startup app. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=259.98s)]
*  In 2021, the alternative video platform Rumble said it was expecting an investment from a group of prominent conservative venture capitalists. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=263.14s)]
*  This included Peter Thiel and Hillbilly Elegy author J.D. Vance. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=270.66s)]
*  And Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person, recently completed his takeover of Twitter, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=274.94s)]
*  with plans to loosen its moderation controls. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=279.86s)]
*  At a TED conference in April, he said, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=282.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=285.1s)]
*  Looking ahead for West, the Parler deal is expected to close later this year. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=293.1s)]
*  In a press statement, Parler's CEO said the acquisition would change the way the world thinks about free speech. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=297.3s)]
*  Despite high-profile backers, data suggests that the alternative social platforms have struggled to gain traction with a wide audience. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=303.18s)]
*  In September, Parler said it had more than 16 million registered users. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=310.3s)]
*  By comparison, Twitter has more than 230 million users on the platform each day. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=314.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, a recent study by the Pew Research Center found that fewer than one in 10 Americans read alternative social media sites for news. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=319.38s)]
*  The study also found that 15 percent of prominent accounts on alternative social media sites [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=326.74s)]
*  have been banned or demonetized elsewhere on the Internet. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=331.34000000000003s)]
*  While most alternative social media apps don't have as many users as more established companies, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=334.78000000000003s)]
*  collectively, they have begun to shape a new environment for some conservative voices. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr7kRKEH1oU&t=340.22s)]
