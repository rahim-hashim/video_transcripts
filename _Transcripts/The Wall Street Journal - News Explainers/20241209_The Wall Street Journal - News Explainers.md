*  Balloons. Balloons. Balloons. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=0.0s)]

*  The demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea is now the front line [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  of a dangerous and bizarre tit-for-tat. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=17.04s)]
*  Thousands of balloons have been launched into the skies above the DMZ, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=19.52s)]
*  while dozens of giant loudspeakers have been set up all along the border. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=22.96s)]
*  North Korea has severed ties with the South in response to what it calls [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=26.72s)]
*  U.S.-backed war games, and has recently blown up roads and railways [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=30.48s)]
*  which link the two countries. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=34.08s)]
*  Here's an inside look at how this fragile border could soon deliver [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  a foreign policy headache for the incoming Trump administration. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=39.2s)]
*  We are not far away from the heavily militarized border [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=44.08s)]
*  separating North and South Korea. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=46.72s)]
*  And right now, we're on a patrol with a special force set up to find activists [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  looking to send balloons, leaflets, and drones that way into North Korea. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=53.12s)]
*  South Korea is trying to manage tensions at the border with these daily patrols. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=58.56s)]
*  Anyone caught by this force faces thousands of dollars of fines, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=62.4s)]
*  or jail time, for up to a year. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=65.76s)]
*  The stakes are high because North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un considers [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=68.72s)]
*  these launches to be highly provocative. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=71.84s)]
*  There is serious concern he will escalate things with a violent response. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=74.0s)]
*  Jae Sung-ryong is one of the activists drawing fury from the Kim regime. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=77.2s)]
*  He's planning to launch 100,000 leaflets into the North, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=80.88000000000001s)]
*  carrying messages personally attacking Kim Jong-un and his regime. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=84.0s)]
*  Images like these that vilify Kim are treated by Pyongyang [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  as a direct attack on the nation itself. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=90.8s)]
*  So you plan to fly this drone from South Korea into North Korea? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=93.36s)]
*  Their aim is to pierce the Kim regime's ironclad control over information, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=107.68s)]
*  and North Koreans found with the leaflets would likely face severe punishment. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  So are you worried that as a result of these leaflets being sent into North Korea, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=115.28s)]
*  something serious could happen from North Korea? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=120.72s)]
*  Pyongyang has warned that the activists will pay a high price if the launches continue. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=137.2s)]
*  North Korea accused Seoul of supporting the launches [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  and has responded by sending back thousands of balloons of a different kind. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=150.88s)]
*  In May, hundreds of giant white balloons carrying trash and excrement [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=155.12s)]
*  began to drift over from North Korea. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=158.56s)]
*  Some have traveled as far as the presidential office in Seoul and beyond. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  The fear in South Korea is that the North could one day use the balloons [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=164.88s)]
*  to send biological or chemical weapons. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=167.92s)]
*  While Pyongyang wants to avoid war in the near term, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=170.48s)]
*  the array of balloons instill fear and strain South Korea's military. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=172.64s)]
*  South Korea hit back at the launches from the North [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  by firing up giant loudspeakers to blast K-pop across the border. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=180.32s)]
*  The music is seen as a sore spot for Kim Jong-un, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=185.76s)]
*  who wants to limit exposure to the outside world inside his impoverished country. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  One morning, villages along the DMZ woke to discover Pyongyang had switched on giant loudspeakers of its own. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=192.88s)]
*  A constant barrage of unbearable noises now flood the border towns day and night. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  What do you make of the activists who want to send balloons to North Korea? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=203.6s)]
*  North Korea has previously threatened artillery strikes against the South Korean loudspeakers, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=233.6s)]
*  and the concern is that an escalating cycle of provocation [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=238.88s)]
*  may one day lead Kim to use his forces along the border. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=241.6s)]
*  North Korea is estimated to have thousands of artillery pieces positioned on its side of the DMZ. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=245.92s)]
*  Analysts have modeled different scenarios in which North Korea fires artillery into South Korea. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  In one scenario, the North uses a dozen artillery pieces to shoot down the North's military. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  In another scenario, the North uses a dozen artillery pieces to launch a surprise attack on a large electronics factory. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=261.2s)]
*  The strike could cause thousands of casualties and possibly affect global economies. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=266.8s)]
*  In the most extreme scenario, North Korea launches a massive artillery barrage along the border, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  striking major cities, airports, and U.S. military bases near the border. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=276.72s)]
*  The think tank concluded this would lead to over 200,000 casualties, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  and that there is little the U.S. could do to stop it once it starts. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=284.88s)]
*  North Korea has begun stationing more troops along the border [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=288.64s)]
*  while dismissing the need for nuclear talks with the incoming Trump administration. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  My friend. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=295.6s)]
*  Donald Trump has touted his close relationship with Kim [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=297.2s)]
*  and made history as the first sitting U.S. president to cross into North Korea. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  That visit marked a high point in diplomacy with the Kim regime. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  But Trump returns to office at a time when relations are sinking [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  and tensions along this border are soaring. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=311.04s)]
*  He may soon be forced to confront a cold conflict that is heating up once more. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ycBmT5J8o&t=313.6s)]
