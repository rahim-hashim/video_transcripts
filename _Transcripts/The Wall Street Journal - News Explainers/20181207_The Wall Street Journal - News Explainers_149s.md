# Why China’s Huawei Poses Threat to the U.S.
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 07, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ)
*  Telecom giant Huawei Technologies has long been at the center of drama between the US and China. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  But what exactly is Huawei, and why is the company so significant? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=8.0s)]
*  Here's what you need to know. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=12.0s)]
*  First and foremost, Huawei is a global telecom behemoth. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=14.0s)]
*  It sold roughly 52 million smartphones in the last quarter, nearly 7 million more than Apple. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=20.0s)]
*  It employs 180,000 people, more people than Intel, and it generated more than $92 billion in revenue last year. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=26.0s)]
*  That's more than twice that of Facebook. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=35.0s)]
*  You might not use Huawei products because they aren't readily available in the US and some other Western countries. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=38.0s)]
*  Regardless, the company is the largest maker of telecom equipment, including things like switches, routers, and cell tower gear. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=44.0s)]
*  Huawei also sells personal computers and a wide array of wireless devices, like smartwatches. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=53.0s)]
*  And it's the second largest smartphone company after Samsung. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=59.0s)]
*  In China, the company is seen as the country's biggest global success story. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=63.0s)]
*  So why is Huawei so important to the US? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=69.0s)]
*  It's all about competition. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=72.0s)]
*  Not only is the telecom giant a rival of major Western companies, but Huawei is also seen as a global leader in 5G, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=74.0s)]
*  the ultra-fast wireless technology that will soon be connected to everything. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=82.0s)]
*  That's good for China and bad for the US. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=86.0s)]
*  Washington worries that if Huawei wins the race to develop 5G technology, Americans could one day be forced to buy equipment from the company. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=90.0s)]
*  And right now, no US companies are seen as major competitors in this area. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=98.0s)]
*  The biggest contenders are Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=103.0s)]
*  But that's not all. Huawei is also seen as a cybersecurity threat to the US. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=109.0s)]
*  Washington has accused the company of being a potential conduit for Chinese spying and cyber theft. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=114.0s)]
*  Because the company is so big and because its technology is used all over the world, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=120.0s)]
*  the US worries that Beijing could force the company to engage in nefarious activities, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=124.0s)]
*  like crippling communications infrastructure, remotely controlling or destroying telecom gear, or even spying on America and its allies. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=130.0s)]
*  For its part, Huawei says its products are completely safe and that the company does not do any bidding for the Chinese government. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUA76spIbWQ&t=139.0s)]
