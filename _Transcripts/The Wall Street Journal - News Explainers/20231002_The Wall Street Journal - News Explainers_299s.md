# FTXs Sam Bankman-Fried on Trial What to Know  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q)
*  For better or for worse, people should get to know what happened. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=0.0s)]
*  After the fall of his business empire, Sam Bankman-Fried, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=5.84s)]
*  once seen as the golden boy of crypto, is about to go on trial. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=9.6s)]
*  He is accused of basically lying to his customers, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=13.8s)]
*  lying to his investors, and lying to lenders about what FTX was doing with customer funds. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  On October 3rd, Bankman-Fried's trial on charges that he defrauded customers of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=24.28s)]
*  billions of dollars will begin in a New York federal court. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=28.88s)]
*  He has pleaded not guilty to all criminal charges. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=32.4s)]
*  Here's what you need to know about the case and the man on trial. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  At 30 years old in 2022, Sam Bankman-Fried had founded two successful companies, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  a trading firm called Alameda Research he started in 2017, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=47.2s)]
*  and a $32 billion cryptocurrency exchange called FTX that came two years later. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=51.32s)]
*  FTX and Alameda Research were run by an inner circle of Sam and his closest friends and colleagues. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=57.12s)]
*  Caroline Ellison, who was the CEO of Alameda Research, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=63.04s)]
*  Gary Wang, who was a co-founder of FTX and responsible for much of its technology, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  and Nishad Singh, who was the director of engineering at FTX. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  The upper management all lived together in a luxury penthouse in the Bahamas that cost $30 million. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=73.88s)]
*  Bankman-Fried was also a familiar face in the political scene on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=79.72s)]
*  In February 2022, he testified at a Senate hearing where he encouraged better regulation of cryptocurrency markets. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  It is the patchwork of regulation that there is simultaneously too many sort of cooks in the kitchen and yet not enough oversight. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=91.4s)]
*  Bankman-Fried personally made $40 million in donations ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  At one point, he was estimated to have a net worth of $15.6 billion. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=106.76s)]
*  He was one of the biggest, richest and most successful people in crypto until last year, when everything collapsed. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=111.6s)]
*  In November 2022, a report from crypto website CoinDesk revealed that most of Alameda's assets were in FTX's tokens, setting off a run. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=117.36s)]
*  But FTX wasn't able to meet the billions of dollars of withdrawals. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=126.83999999999999s)]
*  Bankman-Fried stepped down as CEO and shortly after, FTX filed for bankruptcy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  In traditional finance, regulators require brokerages to segregate customer funds from any capital they use for trading. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  Cryptocurrency is still considered the Wild West, where the rules are murkier. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=144.92s)]
*  This is one of the biggest financial frauds in American history. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  Bankman-Fried was arrested in mid-December in the Bahamas after the U.S. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=154.67999999999998s)]
*  filed criminal charges, including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=158.27999999999997s)]
*  Prosecutors are saying that he stole money from FTX customers to use for various purposes, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=163.2s)]
*  including campaign donations and charitable causes, when that money should have been safe and secure at FTX. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=169.72s)]
*  Less than a year later, he's about to face a jury and his former inner circle. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang and Nishad Singh. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=180.88s)]
*  All three have pleaded guilty to fraud charges and are expected to testify against Bankman-Fried. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=184.32s)]
*  Caroline's testimony will probably be very important in this trial because she was the head of Alameda Research [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=190.84s)]
*  and she would have been closer to the actual trading strategies and Alameda investments than Sam was. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  So she would be in a position to say, yes, we took this money and used it for these purposes and knew that we were doing it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=205.2s)]
*  And here, this is what was Sam's role in that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=212.24s)]
*  And Bankman-Fried could take the stand himself. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=214.76s)]
*  Sam is no ordinary defendant. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  After the collapse of FTX, he gave a whole lot of interviews, tweeted, started a substack and tried to defend himself publicly. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=219.95999999999998s)]
*  So he might be inclined to try and testify in his own defense. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  In an interview with the Journal last December, Bankman-Fried said he bore responsibility for the company's collapse, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=231.6s)]
*  but did not knowingly commit any fraud. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=237.67999999999998s)]
*  I don't think that I did. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=240.48s)]
*  I don't think I tried to commit fraud anywhere here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  I was trying to do the best I could. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=246.64s)]
*  Obviously, that wasn't nearly as good as I thought it was. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  Bankman-Fried could face up to decades in prison if he's found guilty, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=253.0s)]
*  and he has a trial for additional conspiracy and fraud charges tentatively scheduled for March 2024. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=256.96s)]
*  The Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission also have pending civil suits against Bankman-Fried. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=263.2s)]
*  I think people in the crypto industry now want to sort of say, OK, that happened, but we're moving on. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=270.68s)]
*  It will also be a landmark move for prosecutors and the government as they try to regulate and control crypto. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=275.88s)]
*  They'll be able to say, look, if you run a big fraudulent enterprise, we will come after you and put you in jail. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOd-WX989Q&t=283.56s)]
