**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA)
*  An adult film star, a media executive, a fixer, all tied to Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=0.0s)]
*  No matter who you are, we cannot and will not normalise serious criminal conduct. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=6.16s)]
*  Newly unsealed court documents lay out how a web of key players were involved in the events [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=14.16s)]
*  that led to the former president being charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=19.04s)]
*  Trump has pleaded not guilty. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  The only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=26.24s)]
*  Here's a list of who's who in this historic case. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=35.76s)]
*  Adult film star Stormy Daniels met Trump in 2006 at a celebrity golf tournament [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=42.8s)]
*  where she said he invited her to his hotel room. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  And you had sex with him? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=50.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=51.44s)]
*  You were 27, he was 60. Were you physically attracted to him? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=52.9s)]
*  No. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=56.98s)]
*  Daniels tried to sell the story of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump to media outlets multiple times. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=57.94s)]
*  According to court documents annotated by the Wall Street Journal, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=63.54s)]
*  former Trump fixer Michael Cohen covertly paid $130,000 to Daniels shortly before the election [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=66.34s)]
*  to prevent her from publicising a sexual encounter with Trump. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=72.82s)]
*  Cohen, who served as Trump's personal lawyer at the time, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=76.34s)]
*  was a key witness before the grand jury that indicted the former president. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=79.3s)]
*  Court documents say, after the election, Trump reimbursed Cohen for the illegal payment [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=83.3s)]
*  through a series of monthly checks. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=88.02s)]
*  Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison in 2018 after pleading guilty to nine federal criminal [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=90.5s)]
*  counts, including one related to his payment to Daniels. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=96.02s)]
*  Mr. Trump directed me to use my own personal funds from a home equity line of credit [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=99.14s)]
*  to avoid any money being traced back to him that could negatively impact his campaign. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=105.69999999999999s)]
*  Allen Weisselberg, the long-time chief financial officer of the Trump organisation, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=112.74s)]
*  facilitated Cohen's reimbursement for the payment to Daniels, according to Cohen and federal prosecutors. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=116.82s)]
*  In order to be able to put it onto the books, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=122.5s)]
*  Allen Weisselberg made the decision that it should be paid over the 12 months so that it would look [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=128.5s)]
*  like a retainer. Weisselberg hasn't commented publicly about the matter. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=134.9s)]
*  He pleaded guilty in an unrelated state tax fraud case and was sentenced to five months in jail [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=138.74s)]
*  earlier this year. Weisselberg discussed reimbursement for another hush money payment [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=143.86s)]
*  made in 2016 by David Pecker, according to Cohen and prosecutors. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=150.18s)]
*  Pecker is the former chief executive of American Media, Inc., publisher of the National Enquirer, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=154.58s)]
*  and appeared twice before the grand jury. Court documents say he agreed to help with Trump's [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=160.02s)]
*  campaign, saying that he would act as the eyes and ears for the campaign by looking out for negative [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=164.98s)]
*  stories about Trump and alerting Cohen before the stories were published. In August 2016, he bought [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=169.54s)]
*  and killed the story of former Playboy model Karen McDougall, who alleged that she had an affair with [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=175.7s)]
*  Trump in 2006. The court documents say AMI ultimately paid $150,000 to McDougall in exchange [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=180.26s)]
*  for her agreement not to speak about the alleged sexual relationship. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=187.29999999999998s)]
*  Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who took office in January of last year, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=192.89999999999998s)]
*  brought charges against Trump despite his predecessor deciding not to. Bragg alleges that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=196.89999999999998s)]
*  the former president repeatedly violated New York's business records laws in trying to cover up these [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=201.78s)]
*  The charge requires, as I specified, criminal conduct that was concealed. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=207.29999999999998s)]
*  One of the concealed crimes we allege is New York state election law. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=215.94s)]
*  In the coming months, a trial date will be set, which lawyers and legal specialists have said [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=222.66s)]
*  could be pushed out a year or more, putting it squarely in the 2024 campaign season. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=227.22s)]
*  you [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabYtlmCBGA&t=236.66s)]
