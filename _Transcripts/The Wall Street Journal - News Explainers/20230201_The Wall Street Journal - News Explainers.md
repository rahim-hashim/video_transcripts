# Why Is Amtrak Service So Slow in Most of the U.S.?  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54)
*  If you want to travel by Amtrak from Houston to San Antonio, Texas, you only have one option. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=0.0s)]
*  The Sunset Limited, a long-distance train making 22 stops from New Orleans to Los Angeles. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=6.0s)]
*  It only runs three times a week and according to Amtrak, is over an hour and a half late [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=11.42s)]
*  on average. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=15.36s)]
*  Compare that to the Northeast, where 40 Amtrak trains link Philadelphia to New York every [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=17.0s)]
*  day. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=21.76s)]
*  Amtrak has said for years that it wants to replicate this model in fast-growing metropolitan [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=22.76s)]
*  areas like San Antonio, Phoenix and Atlanta. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=26.8s)]
*  But over the last 50 years, the rail network has remained largely unchanged. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=30.2s)]
*  So why hasn't Amtrak expanded? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=34.64s)]
*  The biggest problem for Amtrak in areas outside the Northeast is that they don't control [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=37.2s)]
*  their own fate. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=40.88s)]
*  They're running along tracks that are owned by the major freight railroads of the country. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=41.88s)]
*  If Amtrak wants to increase service, it needs to negotiate with freight carriers. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=46.92s)]
*  But those companies have long resisted calls to make more room on their tracks for passenger [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=50.92s)]
*  trains. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=55.0s)]
*  Really, this just comes down to an inevitable tension when the freight and passenger railroads [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=56.32s)]
*  have to share a limited capacity of track. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=61.16s)]
*  The only area where Amtrak owns most of the tracks is in the Northeast corridor. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=63.96s)]
*  For that reason, and because it's much more heavily a passenger corridor, they're able [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=68.2s)]
*  to run a lot more trains much more frequently and that's why you see the ridership in the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=72.12s)]
*  Northeast that you don't see in other parts of the country. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=75.76s)]
*  Amtrak has been renting tracks from freight companies since its inception. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=78.6s)]
*  That's because freight rail used to move goods and people on its tracks. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=82.52s)]
*  But by the end of the 1960s, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=86.68s)]
*  They were running out of money and they were in particular losing money carrying people. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=88.48s)]
*  So in 1970, Congress bailed out the railroads and created Amtrak to relieve freight of the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=92.84s)]
*  obligation to provide passenger rail service. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=97.72s)]
*  Part of the deal was that freight trains would give Amtrak right of way on its tracks. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Although the law requires them to get out of the way in practice, they don't. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=105.28s)]
*  Amtrak blames freight rail for its delays, saying passenger trains have to wait for freight [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=109.32s)]
*  trains to pass. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=113.63999999999999s)]
*  According to Amtrak, freight rail caused passengers nearly 15,000 hours of delays in 2021. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=114.83999999999999s)]
*  Part of the problem is that freight carriers run longer trains, some stretching over two miles. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  If the train is too long to fit all the way onto that small siding, then you're still [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=127.0s)]
*  going to be in the way of whatever train is behind you. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  Amtrak says freight rail not only prevents it from operating trains at higher speeds, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=134.6s)]
*  but also makes it difficult to add more trains by demanding excessive capital investments. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=138.88s)]
*  The freight and their advocates in Washington can get pretty frustrated about the passenger [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=144.32s)]
*  rail advocates not taking seriously enough the work that they are doing because so much [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=150.0s)]
*  of the nation's commodities and goods are moving around on the rails. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  Privately owned freight companies spend more than $20 billion each year maintaining and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=159.2s)]
*  improving their tracks, according to the American Association of Railroads, a trade group that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=163.3s)]
*  includes Amtrak and freight carriers. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=167.52s)]
*  The group says Amtrak and Freight Rail share the same goals of providing efficient and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=170.28s)]
*  reliable service to both passengers and freight customers across the country. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  The freight railroads also say that they do a better job making way for Amtrak trains [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=180.84s)]
*  than Amtrak would make it sound. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  But if the law requires freight trains to give priority to Amtrak, why hasn't that been [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=187.78s)]
*  enforced? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=191.88s)]
*  There really are two reasons. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=192.88s)]
*  One is that Amtrak has been essentially fighting to survive for most of its history, fighting [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=194.48s)]
*  to survive both because there are people in Congress who would have loved to have it just [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=199.28s)]
*  go away, also because they just struggled sort of budget to budget to just keep the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=202.64s)]
*  lights on. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  That's partly why Amtrak hasn't bought more tracks from freight railroads, because [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  it would be prohibitively expensive. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  And also the freight railroads need these networks so they would not be in the mood [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=215.33999999999997s)]
*  to give up any of this trackage. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=219.7s)]
*  The second reason Amtrak hasn't really been successful pushing back against freight companies [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=222.62s)]
*  is that there hasn't been a good legal structure for Amtrak to assert its rights. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=226.86s)]
*  There was a railroad regulator called the Interstate Commerce Commission, which was [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=231.06s)]
*  winnowed down and eventually eliminated. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=234.3s)]
*  The ICC sometimes did take actions to improve passenger traffic, but it was spotty over [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=236.74s)]
*  the history of Amtrak. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=243.98000000000002s)]
*  But things started to change in 2008. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=246.38s)]
*  Congress passed a law that directed Amtrak to help develop a set of metrics and standards [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=248.7s)]
*  to rate the on-time performance of its trains. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=252.94s)]
*  This would be a way to measure whether Amtrak trains were delayed in a way that they're [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=255.7s)]
*  not supposed to be by freight trains. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=259.86s)]
*  After years of legal wrangling that led all the way to the Supreme Court, the on-time [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=262.53999999999996s)]
*  metrics took effect in October 2021, which gave Amtrak the ability to begin building [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=266.3s)]
*  its case against freight railroads. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=271.14s)]
*  In December 2022, Amtrak filed a complaint against Union Pacific Railroad, its first [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=274.54s)]
*  ever use of the 2008 law. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=279.74s)]
*  In its complaint, Amtrak seized on that Sunset Limited line, its most delayed route in the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=282.22s)]
*  country. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=286.94s)]
*  This is a sign of how aggressive Amtrak is becoming about trying to enforce its rights [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=287.94s)]
*  and being willing to pick a big fight with the freight companies. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  A Union Pacific spokeswoman said the Sunset route is a critical Union Pacific artery, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=295.66s)]
*  and it is essential that Union Pacific and Amtrak collaborate to design a schedule that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=300.22s)]
*  is reasonable and achievable. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=304.3s)]
*  The other big change in Amtrak's situation? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=307.5s)]
*  The 2021 infrastructure law. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=309.90000000000003s)]
*  This law is the most significant investment in rail, the most significant investment in [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=312.90000000000003s)]
*  rail since we created Amtrak over 50 years ago. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=317.90000000000003s)]
*  The railroad received $22 billion in direct aid and will also have access to $44 billion [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=321.96000000000004s)]
*  aimed at boosting passenger rail service. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=327.62s)]
*  They are still and will always be reliant on federal subsidies, but their balance sheet [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=330.06s)]
*  is much stronger. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=334.54s)]
*  They are replacing cars and locomotives at a rate that's much higher than anybody has [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=335.54s)]
*  seen. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=340.26s)]
*  In 2021, Amtrak released its 15-year vision, which includes improving 25 existing routes [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=341.26s)]
*  and adding 39 new ones across the U.S. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=347.26s)]
*  Imagine trains connecting Phoenix, Tucson and Southern California, Dallas, Houston and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=350.14s)]
*  San Antonio, and Nashville, Atlanta and Charlotte. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=354.98s)]
*  Amtrak says this proposal is a starting point, but the Federal Railroad Administration will [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=358.41999999999996s)]
*  help determine the final plan. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=362.7s)]
*  They've done a lot of market research over the past few years about whether there's [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=364.29999999999995s)]
*  demand for passenger rail like this. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=369.14s)]
*  They also have been doing a really aggressive job of courting local officials. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=372.26s)]
*  Amtrak points to that as evidence that this will work. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=376.82s)]
*  Every study shows you, you get from point A to point B on rail, as fast or faster than [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=380.14s)]
*  you can on an automobile, you don't take the car. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=384.85999999999996s)]
*  You get in the train. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=387.74s)]
*  But to make sure customers keep choosing rail over other transportation options, Amtrak [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=389.14s)]
*  says its new service can't have hour-long delays. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=393.5s)]
*  The key to success? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=397.02s)]
*  A new arrangement with the freight railroads. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQukDzKk54&t=398.02s)]
