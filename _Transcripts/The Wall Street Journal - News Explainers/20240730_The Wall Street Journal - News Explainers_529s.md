# How Hezbollah Became a Power in Lebanon and the Middle East | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA)
*  Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollah are on the brink of an all-out war after an attack [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=0.0s)]
*  that left 12 dead at a soccer field in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Hezbollah denied any involvement. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Israel launched a retaliatory attack, targeting one of Hezbollah's top military leaders [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=17.12s)]
*  in the capital city of Beirut just days later. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=21.76s)]
*  The escalation comes after decades of simmering conflict along Israel's northern border. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=25.62s)]
*  In that time, Hezbollah, a U.S.-designated terror organization, has grown from a small [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=31.14s)]
*  militia to a powerful military and political force in the Middle East. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=36.78s)]
*  Here's how Hezbollah built its arsenal and influence, and what the continued fighting [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=41.22s)]
*  could mean for the region. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=46.42s)]
*  To understand how Hezbollah amassed its power, we have to look back five decades, and beyond [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=48.82s)]
*  Lebanon's borders, to Israel and Iran. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=58.18s)]
*  In 1979, Iran was in the aftermath of a revolution that installed Ayatollah Khomeini as Iran's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=61.46s)]
*  first supreme leader of the Islamic Republic. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=68.38s)]
*  Khomeini wanted to unify Islamic groups throughout the Middle East. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=71.14s)]
*  One of the bedrocks of the Islamic Republic was not only the idea of a revolution within [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=75.58s)]
*  Iran, but the whole idea was to export this revolution. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=81.17999999999999s)]
*  Matthew Levitt is a former counterterrorism expert for the FBI, State Department, and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=85.17999999999999s)]
*  U.S. Treasury, and is currently a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=90.42s)]
*  And so they looked first to countries where there are decent-sized Shia minorities. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=95.74s)]
*  One of these was Lebanon, where a conflict had broken out between Israel and Palestinian [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=101.04s)]
*  fighters. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  There were secular Palestinian groups who were kicked out of Jordan and made their way [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=107.0s)]
*  to Lebanon and were using southern Lebanon as a launching pad to carry out attacks against [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=113.04s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  Israel first invaded Lebanon back in 1978 after an attack by Palestinian militants that killed [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=119.76s)]
*  dozens of Israeli civilians. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=124.92s)]
*  And in response, Israel invaded southern Lebanon and the conflict led to hundreds of deaths [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=127.22s)]
*  among Lebanese. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=131.94s)]
*  Then four years later in 1982, Israel invaded southern Lebanon again as a result of skirmishes [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=132.94s)]
*  across the border. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=138.68s)]
*  The Shiites were one of several conflicting religious groups involved in a civil war in [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=139.98s)]
*  the country. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=144.66s)]
*  And some of its militant factions started accepting support from Iran. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=145.96s)]
*  Iran provided intelligence. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=150.34s)]
*  It provided more arms. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=152.22s)]
*  It provided funds. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=154.26s)]
*  By 1982, Iran is sending people across Iraq and Syria to the Beqa Valley and they're [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=156.04s)]
*  establishing in the barracks there a training place in Lebanon. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=162.12s)]
*  And as resources poured in, these Shiite factions became more organized. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=167.56s)]
*  Originally the idea was really just to create an umbrella for these groups, but really it [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=172.84s)]
*  ended up becoming a much more structured, hierarchical organization that became known [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=176.2s)]
*  as Hezbollah, literally the party of God. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=182.52s)]
*  Hezbollah released its first manifesto in 1985. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  The idea, as is made very, very clear in the open letter, that this new group, Hezbollah, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=190.96s)]
*  takes direction from, pledges fealty to Iran, sees the supreme leader of Iran as their leader [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=196.56s)]
*  and the mouthpiece of God on earth, sees the United States and France specifically, but [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=204.0s)]
*  the West in general as the reason for all the world's ills is committed to the destruction [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=209.44s)]
*  of the state of Israel and is against any idea of negotiating with it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=215.44s)]
*  Though Hezbollah has become less dependent on Iran in recent years, as of 2022, it's [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=220.3s)]
*  still received the bulk of its operating budget from Iran, a number the U.S. State Department [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=225.92s)]
*  estimates to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=230.8s)]
*  But Iran isn't the group's only source of support. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=233.88s)]
*  It's also allied with Syria. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=237.64s)]
*  If you look at the map, Syria is strategically located. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=239.88s)]
*  It kind of surrounds Lebanon to the West and North. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=243.0s)]
*  Syria became a very, very important part of the development of Hezbollah over the years. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=247.48s)]
*  Provided headquarters for Hezbollah in Syria, provided their own weapons, and certainly [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=253.6s)]
*  facilitated the provision of Iranian weapons to Hezbollah through Syria. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  These relationships have helped Hezbollah build up its arsenal, which includes a number [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=266.8s)]
*  of sophisticated weapons. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=270.8s)]
*  Hezbollah uses this arsenal to occasionally prod Israel in sort of cross-border skirmishes, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=272.92s)]
*  but it also uses this as deterrence. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=278.6s)]
*  The Israelis know that if they attack Lebanon or, for that matter, Iran, Hezbollah has missiles [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=281.12s)]
*  that can reach Tel Aviv and they have tens of thousands of them. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  As Hezbollah's military power has grown, so has its political influence. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=290.76s)]
*  It's important to remember that in addition to being militia, Hezbollah is also a political [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=295.6s)]
*  party that seeks to curry favor with voters in Lebanon and its Shiite constituents. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=299.8s)]
*  Leading that effort is its longtime leader. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=306.8s)]
*  Since 1992, the leader of Hezbollah and secretary-general has been Hassan Nasrallah, who is a charismatic [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=309.56s)]
*  figure among Lebanese and a trusted ally of Iran. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=315.76000000000005s)]
*  In 1992, Hezbollah also took on an official role in Lebanon's government, with members [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=325.6s)]
*  participating in elections and winning for the first time. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=337.08000000000004s)]
*  Lebanon's political system is divided into the three main religious sects in the country, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  the Sunnis, the Shias, and the Christians. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=346.8s)]
*  Hezbollah, as one of the main Shia groups, commands disproportionate amount of power. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=349.12s)]
*  Hezbollah, being apart from the government, can make its own decisions. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=353.8s)]
*  What does it as an organization want? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  And then it can task its members who are parliamentarians, its members who are ministers or of other [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=358.8s)]
*  positions in government or in the military to do what they can to implement those. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=365.08s)]
*  Under Nasrallah's leadership, Hezbollah has become intertwined with the social fabric of [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=370.2s)]
*  Lebanon. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=374.64s)]
*  Hezbollah, over the years, has become increasingly involved in delivering social services. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=375.64s)]
*  It runs schools, it runs hospitals, it builds infrastructure, it trains farmers. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=380.6s)]
*  And all this has helped Hezbollah cast itself as sort of an alternative to the actual government [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=385.76000000000005s)]
*  in Lebanon. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=391.48s)]
*  If you are getting your child free education and your child gets one hot meal a day at [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=392.48s)]
*  school from Hezbollah, you're probably going to vote for Hezbollah. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=397.76000000000005s)]
*  To help bolster his public standing, Hezbollah also runs extensive media operations. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=401.76000000000005s)]
*  It has various media outlets and an army of journalists who travel with its fighters [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=406.52s)]
*  to the front where it reports on skirmishes with Israel. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  What Hezbollah does through this is build grassroots support, but also builds up what [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=416.84s)]
*  it calls a culture of resistance. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=422.44s)]
*  It's critical for Hezbollah to make people feel that there's something they need to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=425.4s)]
*  resist. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=429.91999999999996s)]
*  It broke out in 2006 after Hezbollah fighters abducted Israeli soldiers across the border. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=430.92s)]
*  Several hundred people were killed in this conflict, primarily Lebanese. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=437.04s)]
*  And this spurred Hezbollah and Iran to expand on the groups and military. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=440.6s)]
*  And since then, Hezbollah's missile arsenal has grown almost tenfold. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  Then in 2013, when it publicly joined the Syrian civil war, defending the regime of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=449.96000000000004s)]
*  Bashar al-Assad. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=455.20000000000005s)]
*  Through that presence, it has become an even more trusted ally of Iran, but it's also strengthened [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=456.68s)]
*  relations with other Iranian allies. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=462.36s)]
*  As Hezbollah's influence has grown, so has tension in the region. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=465.03999999999996s)]
*  Israel and Hezbollah have regularly exchanged fire after the October 7 attacks by Hamas. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=470.03999999999996s)]
*  Israel's military said it believed the strike in the Golan Heights in July was carried out [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=477.76s)]
*  by Hezbollah. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=482.2s)]
*  It also said it was the largest civilian casualty event in Israel since October 7. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=483.76s)]
*  Israel authorized a retaliatory attack the following day, as the U.S. and other countries [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=489.64s)]
*  attempted to de-escalate the situation. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=494.88s)]
*  We're in conversations with the government of Israel. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=496.92s)]
*  And again, I emphasize its right to defend its citizens and our determination to make [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=501.08s)]
*  sure that they're able to do that. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=508.68s)]
*  But we also don't want to see the conflict escalate. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=510.44s)]
*  We don't want to see it spread. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=513.58s)]
*  That has been one of our goals from day one, from October 7 on. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=514.58s)]
*  But the conflict has continued to escalate. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCT0aaoBcaA&t=520.1800000000001s)]
