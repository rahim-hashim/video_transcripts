# Why Apple Store Closures May Tell Us Where Covid-19 Will Hit Next | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 23, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54)
*  Let's begin here in the U.S. on March 14, 2020. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=0.0s)]
*  There are 1,678 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. that day, according to the World [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=6.2s)]
*  Health Organization. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=13.0s)]
*  That same day, Apple decides to close its stores across the country. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=15.26s)]
*  Well, Apple is temporarily closing all of its stores outside China. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=20.0s)]
*  A week later, on March 21, cases in the U.S. have gone up by over 800%. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=25.28s)]
*  And in that week, dozens and dozens of more retailers close, including Nike, Sephora, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=32.4s)]
*  IKEA and The Gap. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=38.68s)]
*  We tracked hundreds of store closures, global coronavirus case data, and official lockdown [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=40.980000000000004s)]
*  measures, and found that as the virus spread across the world, Apple has been one of the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=46.08s)]
*  first to close its stores, specifically in the United States. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=52.04s)]
*  In most instances, Apple shutdowns proved to be an early indicator of the trajectory [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=56.32s)]
*  of individual cases, other retail closures and government-mandated lockdowns. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=61.28s)]
*  One piece that's really surprised me most about the pandemic more broadly and how Apple [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=67.0s)]
*  has behaved is the number of companies that have either followed their lead or are looking [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=72.64s)]
*  for information from Apple. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=78.44s)]
*  Now, with states coming out of lockdown, Apple has reopened and re-closed some stores. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=80.96s)]
*  Some news here from Apple that it's going to temporarily close some stores again here, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=87.36s)]
*  Scott, due to COVID-19 spikes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=92.32s)]
*  That could be a signal of what's ahead. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=95.56s)]
*  It's sort of like the Waffle House, minus the waffles. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=98.32s)]
*  See, the American restaurant chain changes its menu based on how severe it thinks a hurricane [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=101.68s)]
*  or storm may be, closing only when the damage is expected to be extreme. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=107.16s)]
*  So, is Apple the COVID equivalent, or is Apple just more nimble than other retailers because [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=112.64s)]
*  of its business strategy and $200 billion in the bank? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=119.08s)]
*  Apple wasn't always ahead on store shutdowns. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=124.16s)]
*  Take its first closure in Tsingtao, China on January 28. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=127.52s)]
*  There were 5,974 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China that day. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=131.92s)]
*  Yet, other stores like Starbucks and The Gap had closed some of its China stores that same [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=137.44s)]
*  day or earlier. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=142.27999999999997s)]
*  Within a week of Apple's first closure, COVID cases in China had grown 307%. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=144.11999999999998s)]
*  On February 1, Apple shut all 40-plus of its mainland China locations. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  John Emmanuel Biondi is a principal at Deloitte and works with some of the world's top retailers. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=156.0s)]
*  We did not have any idea at that point of time of what was about to come. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=161.88s)]
*  The discussion we had was related to the impact of COVID, not so much on the consumers and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=167.12s)]
*  the market in the United States, but the disruption from a supply chain standpoint. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=173.24s)]
*  By March, with the virus spreading far beyond China, Apple moved a lot faster. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=178.2s)]
*  More than a week before the UK went into lockdown, on March 14, Apple closed its stores in the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=184.06s)]
*  country, while others like Nike, Adidas and Starbucks stayed open for two to six days [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=189.64s)]
*  longer. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=195.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, the rest of Apple stores outside of China closed on the 14th too, including [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=196.92s)]
*  in the U.S., where it has 271 stores. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=203.32s)]
*  That's more than any other country. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  I would say that every retailer who is in Asia looked at the measures that were implemented [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=209.0s)]
*  in Asia and say, can I implement or to what extent can I implement some of the similar [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=215.4s)]
*  measures in the United States? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=221.04s)]
*  In the U.S., only Patagonia closed that same day. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=224.16s)]
*  Over the next week, more than 50 major retailers closed. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=228.44s)]
*  And then in May, stores began reopening. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=232.52s)]
*  And in June, Apple hit the brakes and re-closed some, including in Texas, California and Florida. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=235.44s)]
*  In Orlando specifically, Apple re-closed its store at the Florida mall on June 26. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=242.8s)]
*  Two weeks later, cases in that county had more than doubled. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=248.96s)]
*  Still, other retailers in the area, including Nike and Best Buy, remained open. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=252.60000000000002s)]
*  Both companies declined to comment. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=258.56s)]
*  So how does Apple decide when and where to close? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=261.16s)]
*  The company says it looks at the following data on the county level. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=264.8s)]
*  Case numbers, positivity rates, hospital, ICU, and ventilator usage, asymptomatic testing, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=268.78s)]
*  and more. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=275.38s)]
*  If public info isn't available, the company says it calls public health departments to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=276.38s)]
*  request data. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=280.73999999999995s)]
*  But why Apple? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=282.85999999999996s)]
*  Why has the company been quicker to close stores than others? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=284.65999999999997s)]
*  It's not because Apple stores aren't money makers. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=288.41999999999996s)]
*  But rather, they're not Apple's only way to make money. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=291.41999999999996s)]
*  And Apple has the money to do it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=294.97999999999996s)]
*  Stephen Munster has been researching Apple for nearly 20 years. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=297.62s)]
*  We estimate that their physical stores are somewhere between 8 and 10 percent of total [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=300.98s)]
*  revenue. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=307.22s)]
*  And online is an additional 10 to 12 percent of total revenue. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=308.42s)]
*  Munster and other analysts predict that large parts of the physical retail sales have shifted [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=315.06s)]
*  to online. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=320.32s)]
*  During the second quarter of 2020, which included the months of January to March, Apple sold [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=321.72s)]
*  nearly $50 billion worth of products. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=326.88s)]
*  And CEO Tim Cook told CNBC its online growth was off the charts. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=330.12s)]
*  The bigger cost to Apple in store closures? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=336.32s)]
*  In the March quarter, Apple paid out to its retail employees about $100 million, even [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=339.08s)]
*  though they weren't actually in the stores working. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=345.68s)]
*  In the June quarter, that number is going to be just under $200 million. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=349.2s)]
*  And so keep in mind, brick and mortar retail business is close to a $30 billion a year [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=354.44s)]
*  annual business. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=359.24s)]
*  And so even though these numbers are large, they have the framework to continue to support [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=360.36s)]
*  and pay for employees throughout the pandemic. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=366.94s)]
*  Apple's free cash flow in the March quarter was $30.3 billion, even as its stores were [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=370.96s)]
*  closing. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=376.72s)]
*  Much of that came from online sales. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=377.88s)]
*  That allowed it to pay its retail staff despite its stores being shut. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=380.88s)]
*  And Apple can continue to do so because it has one of the biggest rainy day funds in [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=384.62s)]
*  business. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=388.96s)]
*  When you factor in its debt, Apple has a little over $80 billion of cash in the bank. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=390.6s)]
*  Compare that with Nike's $8 billion or Best Buy's nearly $4 billion. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=396.52s)]
*  Apple has so much cash on hand that it could run its operations for more than a year without [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=401.12s)]
*  cutting its costs or selling a single iPhone. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=405.84s)]
*  They have a lot of money. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=409.02s)]
*  They have an ability to navigate this unlike most companies. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=410.56s)]
*  And so I would look for Apple to have more store closings than other retailers who are [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=414.68s)]
*  navigating a lot of the same information. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FkTshHo54&t=420.24s)]
