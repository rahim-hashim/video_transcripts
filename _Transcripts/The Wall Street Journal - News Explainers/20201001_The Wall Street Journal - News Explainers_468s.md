# Developers vs. App Store Apple's Fights, Explained  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 01, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM)
*  On the surface, it looks like Apple is having a pretty good year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=0.0s)]
*  After all, it did become the world's most valuable publicly traded company. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=4.4s)]
*  But behind the scenes, its long-standing disputes with app developers are bubbling over into public view. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=9.44s)]
*  Apple is facing stiff backlash over the way it runs the app store at a time when the app store is a key part of its business. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=16.32s)]
*  Cue the Fortnite gaming controversy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=25.04s)]
*  Over the summer, Epic Games publicly rebelled against the app store's 30% fees and urged players to join its fight against Apple. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=30.16s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Apple just banned Fortnite. What? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=39.04s)]
*  It's going down. Apple versus Fortnite. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=42.96s)]
*  They're probably the one company out there right now that is so beloved by the public that they'll be able to at least, you know, put up the best fight. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  It's not just Epic Games. Spotify, Airbnb, Tinder, Facebook, and Netflix have all had disputes with Apple over app store rules. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  All while lawmakers are scrutinizing Apple and other tech companies for potential antitrust violations. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=66.88s)]
*  What's to stop Apple from increasing its commission to 50%? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=72.96s)]
*  We, sir, we have never increased commissions in the store since the first day it operated in 2008. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=78.0s)]
*  So what are app makers asking for? And is Apple going to listen? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=85.44s)]
*  First, it's important to understand how crucial the app store has become to Apple's business. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  In recent years, Apple's been shifting its focus from selling more devices like iPhones to selling more software and services. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=97.28s)]
*  Think Apple Music, Apple Care, and of course the app store. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=104.88s)]
*  Apple One gives you and your family all the services you love in one simple plan. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=108.72s)]
*  In 2020, its services business, which includes the app store, helped the company set a new sales record in the June quarter. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=114.72s)]
*  Apple doesn't break out its app store revenue, but analysts estimate it brought in roughly $17.5 billion for fiscal year 2020. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=122.4s)]
*  Some apps and services are particularly important for the app store ecosystem, like Fortnite. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=131.84s)]
*  The game has more than 100 million registered users on Apple devices. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=138.0s)]
*  That's produced more than a billion dollars in global app store spending since its launch in 2018. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=142.32s)]
*  But in August, Fortnite was kicked off the app store altogether. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=148.32s)]
*  That's because the game's creator, Epic Games, set up a system to get money directly from players without paying Apple its cut. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=152.32s)]
*  Apple takes a 30% commission on sales of apps and in-app purchases. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  So if an app costs $4.99 upfront, Apple collects $1.50 while the app creator gets the rest. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  Same goes for if you use an app to buy digital goods, like virtual weapons, or sign up for a subscription to a monthly service. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=171.84s)]
*  But the fee doesn't apply to physical goods and services, like clothing purchases or home rentals. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=179.6s)]
*  What Epic Games did was it tried to skirt that commission by adding its own payment system to the Fortnite app on iPhones and iPads. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  That goes against Apple's rules. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  Apple pulled Fortnite from the app store. Epic sued Apple and then Apple filed a countersuit. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=196.96s)]
*  Google pulled Fortnite from Google Play in August for the same reason. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=203.28s)]
*  And since the two companies banned the app, their monthly revenue from the game has taken a big hit. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  From a developer perspective, it definitely feels like we're forced to pay 30% right off the top. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  Austin Benson developed an app for Apple and Android called Hang that helped organize meetups. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=218.4s)]
*  And he's currently a CTO at a small tech startup. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=224.4s)]
*  It literally feels like a tax and those dollars don't really go towards a government to pay roads and bridges. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=228.4s)]
*  They go to pay two of the biggest and arguably most powerful corporations in the world. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  In late September, Spotify, the owner of Tinder and Epic Games teamed up to pressure Apple and other app store operators to change their rules. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  Apple and Google have defended their business practices, saying the commission fees are necessary because of the services the stores provide, including security and safeguarding user privacy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=249.68s)]
*  In some cases, the battle over app store fees has also spilled over into accusations of Apple allegedly stifling competition. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=261.2s)]
*  Enter Spotify's fight with Apple. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=269.68s)]
*  In 2019, Spotify filed a formal complaint to the EU, accusing Apple of making it difficult for rivals of Apple Music to promote their subscription services without using Apple's payment system. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=272.56s)]
*  Apple takes a 30% cut on subscriptions for the first year and 15% the second year. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=285.76s)]
*  If you were to upgrade to premium in our app through the app store, we'd have to give Apple a whopping 30% of your subscription fee. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=290.88s)]
*  Spotify didn't want to pay that fee on its premium subscription revenue, so it removed the option to sign up from within the app. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=299.36s)]
*  Users can still register on Spotify's website, but Apple's rules don't allow Spotify to direct users from the app to its site. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  Netflix has taken a similar approach, telling users you can't sign up for Netflix in the app, and Tinder charges members more to sign up in the app compared to its website. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  Apple said that developers are free to promote other pricing outside of the app store, including on television and billboards. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=326.0s)]
*  Certainly when you see the big heavyweight companies like Netflix and Spotify make that move, you can imagine that other companies are considering the same thing. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  But you look at a Netflix and a Spotify, they're in a better position in the market themselves, so they could potentially do a TV commercial that says sign up here. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=340.96s)]
*  Smaller companies may not have that ability. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=349.44s)]
*  Apple has said it doesn't give its own products an advantage, and that its 30% fee is in line with the rest of the industry. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=352.4s)]
*  But if you're an app developer, your business largely depends on just two companies, Apple and Google. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=359.44s)]
*  Roughly 95% of all mobile app spending in the US happens on the app store and Google Play. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=367.84s)]
*  We have Congress, the Department of Justice, the European Union, the FTC, they're all investigating Apple, and other technology giants too on antitrust grounds. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=374.0s)]
*  Google and Amazon and Facebook, they're under the spotlight as well. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=384.48s)]
*  The attention though with Apple by these government entities though has so far centered largely around the app store. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=388.0s)]
*  And the app store has become essentially Apple's bread and butter. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=395.76s)]
*  In late September, Apple said it would exempt some apps from paying commissions on virtual events hosted during the pandemic. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  But many app makers say they want Apple to review its commission policies altogether. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  And Apple's legal battles aren't going away anytime soon. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=412.48s)]
*  Depending on how things play out, the Fortnite case could have a lasting impact on how much revenue developers are able to keep and how apps accept payments altogether. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=416.24s)]
*  The biggest thing that I'm watching on the sidelines is, is Apple going to continue to take 30% because that is just a large number off the top. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=426.0s)]
*  Which means I have that much less to hire sales and marketing teams, hire other developers and get my product out to other people. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  And it makes it that much harder as a small business to survive. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=443.04s)]
*  There are all sorts of possibilities as to what could happen or things could stay the status quo. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=445.68s)]
*  But given the importance of the app store to Apple's bottom line, should the outcome be such changes, that could have a serious effect on Apple's finances. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZXWf65yhGM&t=451.2s)]
