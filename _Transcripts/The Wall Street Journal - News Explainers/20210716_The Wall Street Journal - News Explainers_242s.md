# How Venus Fits Into the Search for Life Beyond Earth | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 16, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns)
*  It's known as Earth's evil twin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=0.0s)]
*  Venus gives us a glimpse into both our past and our future. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=3.16s)]
*  A past where water formed and perhaps life arose before it did on Earth, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=6.98s)]
*  and our future where Earth will heat up. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  So Venus is a fascinating place to look at Earth in a mirror. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  The two planets are close in age, size, and makeup. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=19.34s)]
*  But unlike Earth, Venus evolved into a kind of toxic wasteland. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=23.12s)]
*  It lost its surface water and became hot enough to melt lead. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=27.04s)]
*  So what happened? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=31.08s)]
*  Researchers are hoping to answer that question, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  and whether Venus may have once been brimming with life, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=35.18s)]
*  with three new missions to the hot planet. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  They will offer the entire science community the chance to investigate a planet [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=42.06s)]
*  we haven't been to in more than 30 years. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  In those 30 years, much of the attention has gone to Mars. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=50.68s)]
*  Mars is not like Earth and Venus. Mars is much smaller. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=54.64s)]
*  It's only about four-seventh the size of Earth. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=58.28s)]
*  Venus turns out to be the other planet in our solar system, which is the most Earth-like. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=61.84s)]
*  But yet a horrible fate has befallen Venus. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=66.16s)]
*  Dr. Darby Dyer is among a group of scientists working on the new missions to Venus. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=69.7s)]
*  She's part of the scientific leadership team for one called Veritas, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=74.16s)]
*  and it's set to launch at the end of the decade. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=77.62s)]
*  The spacecraft will take a census of the rock types on Venus. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=80.16s)]
*  That data is essential for understanding what happened to Venus, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=83.5s)]
*  and if it hosted life, where it might have been. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=87.02s)]
*  Imagine that sometime in the last billion years, Earth was completely covered by basalt. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=90.18s)]
*  The only thing that would stick up from the basaltic ocean if that happened [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=96.38s)]
*  would be the continents, the high places. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=99.82s)]
*  So it's sort of like the Noah's Ark on a planet. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=101.94s)]
*  Basalt are dark, fine-grained rocks that kind of line the ocean floors here on Earth. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=104.78s)]
*  Continents are made up mostly of a different kind of rock called granite, which is lighter. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=110.06s)]
*  Scientists are interested in granites because they form in the presence of water, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=114.78s)]
*  a key molecule for life. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=118.54s)]
*  On Venus, those are the two primary rocks that Veritas wants to locate in ID. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=120.3s)]
*  And it's going to try to do that as it orbits Venus. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=125.58s)]
*  It's staggering to me that we know so little about the surface of Venus. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=130.22s)]
*  And what that means is that anything we find with these missions is going to be really amazing [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=134.46s)]
*  and exciting and first of its kind. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=138.7s)]
*  That huge undertaking comes down in part to this sensor. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=141.1s)]
*  Before launch, Dyer and her collaborators are training the device [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=145.01999999999998s)]
*  and its machine learning brains on Earth rocks. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=148.38s)]
*  Let's take a look at how that process works. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=151.14s)]
*  First, Dyer collected a diverse set of rocks. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=155.17999999999998s)]
*  Then they were cut and ground. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=158.14s)]
*  The samples are then sent to a lab at the German Aerospace Center in Berlin. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=161.82s)]
*  There, researchers heat up the rock chips to more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=166.3s)]
*  in this so-called Venus chamber. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=170.62s)]
*  It's meant to mimic the surface temperatures on the planet. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=173.74s)]
*  At such high temperatures, rocks heat up so much that they glow. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=176.54000000000002s)]
*  The kind of light they give off depends on what the rocks are made of. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=181.02s)]
*  Dark basalts emit more light than lighter granites. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=184.3s)]
*  That light is captured by the prototype Veritas sensor [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=187.66000000000003s)]
*  through a special kind of glass window on the Venus chamber. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=190.78s)]
*  Eventually, when Veritas reaches Venus, its sensors will scan the planet [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=193.98s)]
*  and compare the new data to rocks it studied here on Earth. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=198.14s)]
*  The geological processes act the same and therefore the rock types, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=201.82s)]
*  we are fairly confident, are going to be the same. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=206.45999999999998s)]
*  If Veritas can map out granite formations on Venus, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=208.7s)]
*  that could help scientists figure out where to send future landers [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=211.42s)]
*  to narrow down the search for signs of life. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=214.62s)]
*  Habitability, that's the endgame. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=217.1s)]
*  Not only do we care about habitability on Earth and Venus, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=219.89999999999998s)]
*  but we also care about the habitability of objects [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=222.54s)]
*  in other solar systems throughout the universe, which are called exoplanets. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=226.14s)]
*  And if there are other Earth and Venus-like objects out there, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=229.9s)]
*  then maybe we're not alone. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=232.94s)]
*  And that's a really important question that we really love to understand. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-UJ3yWpQns&t=234.38s)]
