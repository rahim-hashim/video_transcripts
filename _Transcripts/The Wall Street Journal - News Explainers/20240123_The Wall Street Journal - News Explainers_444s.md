Video Description: China’s Rocket Force arsenal is regarded as the crown jewel of the People’s Liberation Army. In recent years, the secretive Chinese military unit has test-launched more ballistic missiles than the rest of the world combined. All American bases in the Asia-Pacific, including Guam, are within range of precision missiles from the Chinese mainland. 

WSJ looks at how China’s Rocket Force is preparing for a possible invasion of Taiwan and deterring the U.S. from intervening.

# This Chinese Military Unit Runs One of the World's Largest Missile Forces | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ)
*  This map shows the maximum range of China's land-based conventional strike missiles in 2015. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Less than a decade later, that range has doubled, putting all American bases in the Asia Pacific, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=7.0s)]
*  including Guam, within the range of precision missiles fired from the Chinese mainland. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=13.0s)]
*  A secretive Chinese military unit is responsible for that expansion, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=18.0s)]
*  and now controls one of the largest and most diverse land-based missile forces in the world. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=22.0s)]
*  Details of the force are some of China's most tightly guarded secrets, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=27.0s)]
*  but Western intelligence agencies and researchers have revealed evidence of its dramatic rise. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=32.0s)]
*  China has rapidly increased its missile arsenal. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=38.0s)]
*  This is a menacing challenge to the United States. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=42.0s)]
*  In August 2023, Chinese leader Xi Jinping suddenly ousted and replaced the head [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=49.0s)]
*  of an opaque military unit called the Rocket Force. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=54.0s)]
*  China's leaders have tasked this force with its highest military objective, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=57.0s)]
*  preparing for a possible invasion of Taiwan and deterring the United States from intervening. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=61.0s)]
*  In recent years, the force has test-launched hundreds of ballistic missiles [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=71.0s)]
*  at a rate that has exceeded the rest of the world combined. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=75.0s)]
*  Alexander Neill is a former defence analyst for the British government. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=78.0s)]
*  The PLA Rocket Force has six bases spread across China, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=82.0s)]
*  in an arc in the south, which are responsible for a potential Taiwan conflict, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=87.0s)]
*  then up in the northeast, which is responsible for Korean Peninsula and targeting Japan. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=93.0s)]
*  There's a dedicated base in central China, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=100.0s)]
*  and finally a base which is responsible for the northwest of China. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=104.0s)]
*  On top of these six main bases, which are numbered from 61 to 66, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=111.0s)]
*  the Rocket Force also has several supporting bases, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=115.0s)]
*  one of which is regarded as the most important. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=118.0s)]
*  Base 67 is the most secretive of the PLA Rocket Force bases, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=121.0s)]
*  the guardian of China's strategic nuclear deterrent. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=128.0s)]
*  Little is known about the base in Baojie City in central China, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=133.0s)]
*  but bunkers dug into the Qingling Mountain Range on the outskirts of the city [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=137.0s)]
*  houses most of China's nuclear warheads stockpile. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=141.0s)]
*  From Base 67, the warheads are subsequently distributed by rail all across China, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=144.0s)]
*  northwest, northeast and into the south, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=151.0s)]
*  across the brigades responsible for launch and deployments of the nuclear deterrent. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=155.0s)]
*  The bases in China's north are tasked with maintaining nuclear-capable [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=161.0s)]
*  intercontinental ballistic missiles focused on targets on the US mainland. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=165.0s)]
*  A number of scientists looking at civilian imagery [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=169.0s)]
*  spotted three new missile silo fields under development. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=173.0s)]
*  The silo fields are based in very desertified areas [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=179.0s)]
*  outside of Hami, Yumen City and Ordos City. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=184.0s)]
*  Siloes are built as circular tubes into the ground [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=188.0s)]
*  and contain propellants to launch missiles. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=191.0s)]
*  You can see here the Ordos silo field, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=194.0s)]
*  which is typically made up of about a hundred siloes here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=197.0s)]
*  An important aspect of silo fields is something called a shell game. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=201.0s)]
*  You might have 100 siloes, but you may fill only 50% of them. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=207.0s)]
*  And the adversary has to calculate which of those siloes are armed [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=212.0s)]
*  in order to make a calculation for a counter-strike. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=217.0s)]
*  And a shell game is designed to keep the adversary guessing [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=221.0s)]
*  and also to reserve your own number of warheads as well. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=225.0s)]
*  The construction in Ordos, Hami and Yumen is thought to be the most extensive [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=229.0s)]
*  build-up of missile silos since the Cold War. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=233.0s)]
*  If China mounts nuclear warheads on missiles in these silos, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=237.0s)]
*  it would present a huge strategic shift for US military planners. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=240.0s)]
*  You can see here that the arc of the three silo fields [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=244.0s)]
*  is designed to launch missiles over the North Pole [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=249.0s)]
*  and to the continental United States. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=253.0s)]
*  All this could give Beijing the military capability to deter Washington [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=257.0s)]
*  from engaging China militarily in the event of an invasion of Taiwan. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=261.0s)]
*  The rocket force recently demonstrated its capability [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=267.0s)]
*  to strike Taiwan during a conflict. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=270.0s)]
*  Subordinate to Base 61 are a number of brigades involved in the targeting [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=272.0s)]
*  of Taiwan during missile tests when Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August 2022. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=279.0s)]
*  China conducted several days of military exercises. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=289.0s)]
*  A number of short and intermediate range missiles were launched into exclusion zones [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=292.0s)]
*  to the north and south of Taiwan. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=299.0s)]
*  One of them was to the east in Seaboard, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=301.0s)]
*  and there were also some short range rocket firings between Taiwan and Fujian province. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=303.0s)]
*  China has been building up its missile capacity near Taiwan for years, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=311.0s)]
*  but drills during Pelosi's visit demonstrate the rocket force's new capability [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=315.0s)]
*  to target the entire periphery of Taiwan. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=320.0s)]
*  These brigades are one of the sharpest tools in their arsenal [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=323.0s)]
*  to mount a devastating missile attack on the island, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=327.0s)]
*  to blockade the island, to close off shipping lanes, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=332.0s)]
*  and to mount a stranglehold on the island during times of political sensitivity. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=337.0s)]
*  China views Taiwan's autonomy and its links with the US as a geostrategic vulnerability. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=344.0s)]
*  So if we flip the map, it depicts the challenge that China is facing. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=349.0s)]
*  It's hemmed in to some degree by the first island chain [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=354.0s)]
*  and to a lesser extent by the second island chain. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=359.0s)]
*  It's a dilemma of oceanic geography, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=363.0s)]
*  but in a military sense this is why the rocket force is so important. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=367.0s)]
*  The rocket force would play a key role to prevent intervention of the United States and allies [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=371.0s)]
*  were war to break out over Taiwan. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=378.0s)]
*  The rocket force has developed missiles capable of striking US forces, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=380.0s)]
*  coming to Taiwan's aid, within the first and second island chains. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=384.0s)]
*  One of these is the Dongfeng 26, known as the carrier killer. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=388.0s)]
*  The weapon has been deployed to a number of brigades, posing a challenge to the US. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=393.0s)]
*  The DF-26 can be either conventionally armed or nuclear armed. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=397.0s)]
*  It can accurately target bases like Guam, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=402.0s)]
*  but it can also target an aircraft carrier strike group. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=407.0s)]
*  So this presents a major challenge for the United States in terms of its counter intervention campaign. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=411.0s)]
*  The Biden administration has said US forces will support Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=418.0s)]
*  China's rocket force now presents a serious threat to the US's ability to do that, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=424.0s)]
*  dramatically raising the stakes in any conflict over the island. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=429.0s)]
*  China's Ministry of Defence did not respond to a request for comment. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SgPTgspXQ&t=433.0s)]
