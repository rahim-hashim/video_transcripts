**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY)
*  Thank you very much, Mr. President. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=0.0s)]
*  President Donald Trump's pick to oversee 18 intelligence agencies, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=2.0s)]
*  including the FBI and CIA, is facing renewed scrutiny [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=5.64s)]
*  over an unannounced trip to Syria in 2017. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=9.52s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reviewed congressional filings and travel itineraries [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=13.16s)]
*  that detailed two meetings Tulsi Gabbard had with then-President Bashar al-Assad. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=17.0s)]
*  The previously undisclosed visit with the dictator raised alarms when it came to light. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=21.76s)]
*  Talk to me, how do you explain your meeting with Assad to skeptical senators? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=26.16s)]
*  Critics say the meetings reflect a pattern of her questioning U.S. intelligence [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=29.72s)]
*  and embracing Washington's adversaries, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=33.84s)]
*  while supporters argue that her positions represent an anti-war, non-interventionist perspective. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  Here's what the documents and the meetings they reveal [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=42.72s)]
*  indicate about the nominee's approach to U.S. intelligence and foreign threats. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  Gabbard's trip came on the heels of Assad and his Russian backers retaking the city of Aleppo. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=51.92s)]
*  It had been the last major rebel stronghold in the country's nearly six-year civil war. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=57.04s)]
*  The loss was a strategic blow to the numerous factions in the conflict, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=62.6s)]
*  which included a mix of foreign back groups, secular-leaning rebels, and U.S.-designated terrorists. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=66.44s)]
*  By the time Gabbard left for Syria in 2017, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=73.24s)]
*  more than 135,000 civilians had been killed in the uprising, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=76.6s)]
*  according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=80.64s)]
*  and the consequences of Assad's crackdown had caught the world's attention. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=83.48s)]
*  Congressional disclosure forms submitted by Gabbard's office after her return from Syria [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=89.12s)]
*  included two itineraries. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=93.48s)]
*  A proposed itinerary, which was approved by the House Committee on Ethics before she left, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=95.36s)]
*  has no mention of Assad. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=99.68s)]
*  The final itinerary says it reflects more meetings than the proposed itinerary. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  This final itinerary shows that a meeting with Assad came 45 minutes [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=106.4s)]
*  after Gabbard arrived in Damascus from Beirut and lasted about an hour and a half. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=111.24s)]
*  The document says Gabbard then had a one-hour meeting with First Lady Asma al-Assad, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=116.56s)]
*  a London-born Syrian banker who had been under international sanctions since 2012 [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=121.24s)]
*  because of her ties to the regime. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=125.88s)]
*  The next day, video shot by Gabbard's spouse shows the congresswoman touring Aleppo, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=128.24s)]
*  where she met with humanitarian workers and religious leaders. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=133.12s)]
*  Gabbard later said that they called for peace and an end to foreign support of terrorists [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=136.76s)]
*  who were trying to rid Syria of its secular, pluralistic, free society. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  We are not having rebels. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=145.56s)]
*  We have terrorists. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  The day after that, documents show Gabbard met with Walid al-Muallim, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=149.84s)]
*  the country's foreign minister who had previously accused the U.S. and its allies [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=153.28s)]
*  of supporting terrorist groups seeking to destabilize the Assad regime. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  Immediately after, Gabbard met again with the Syrian president. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=161.76s)]
*  On the final day in Syria, the itinerary shows a one-and-a-half-hour meeting [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  with Syrian political opposition leaders, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=170.0s)]
*  some of whom Gabbard said led protests against the Assad regime [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=172.48s)]
*  at the beginning of the conflict in 2011. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=175.56s)]
*  A Trump administration spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  During an interview days after the trip, the congresswoman discussed her reason for the visit, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=184.44s)]
*  which she'd previously described as a fact-finding trip organized by peace advocates. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=188.76s)]
*  I wanted to see if there was, in some small way, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=193.72s)]
*  a way that I could express the love and the aloha and the care that the American people have [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  for the people of Syria and to see firsthand what was happening there, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=203.08s)]
*  to see that situation there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=207.6s)]
*  The final itinerary showing her meeting with Assad less than an hour after her arrival in Damascus states, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=209.88s)]
*  as similar to the original submission approved by the House Committee on Ethics on January 12, 2017, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=216.4s)]
*  this trip to the Middle East consisted of travel within Lebanon and Syria. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  The final itinerary reflects changes due to the rapidly shifting environment in Syria and Lebanon [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  and due to our desire to meet as many individuals and groups within Syria and Lebanon. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=231.28s)]
*  Initially, I hadn't planned on meeting him. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=236.72s)]
*  When the opportunity arose to meet with him, I did so because I felt it's important [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=239.16s)]
*  that if we profess to truly care about the Syrian people, about their suffering, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  then we've got to be able to meet with anyone that we need to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=249.52s)]
*  if there is a possibility that we could achieve peace. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=253.8s)]
*  And that's exactly what we talked about. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=257.08s)]
*  Gabbard says her foreign policy views have been shaped by her experience [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=260.04s)]
*  as an Army Reserve Lieutenant Colonel who served in Iraq. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  In 2013, she questioned U.S. policy on Syria when President Obama sought congressional authorization [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  for a military strike in the country. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=272.6s)]
*  The administration said it knew, based on U.S. intelligence, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=274.68s)]
*  that the Assad regime had planned a chemical weapons attack that killed more than 1,400 people, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=277.6s)]
*  including more than 400 children. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=282.92s)]
*  Young girls and boys gassed to death by their own government. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=285.48s)]
*  This attack is an assault on human dignity. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=290.88s)]
*  It also presents a serious danger to our national security. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=295.16s)]
*  The attack came despite Obama's 2012 warning that movement or use of chemical weapons [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=299.32000000000005s)]
*  would constitute a, quote, red line. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=304.48s)]
*  In the years that followed, Gabbard introduced bills aimed at preventing U.S. support [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=307.16s)]
*  from reaching Syrian opposition groups. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=311.20000000000005s)]
*  By helping groups fighting to overthrow Assad, we're essentially helping ISIS and al-Qaeda [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=313.8s)]
*  achieve their objective of taking over all of Syria. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=318.24s)]
*  Less than three months after her trip to Syria, Gabbard said she was, quote, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  skeptical when the Trump administration found that Assad launched a chemical attack on civilians. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  Including women, small children, and even beautiful little babies. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=332.32s)]
*  Their deaths was an affront to humanity. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=340.76s)]
*  President Trump ordered a military strike against a Syrian air base in what the Pentagon [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=346.64s)]
*  called a proportional response to the attack. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  These heinous actions by the Assad regime cannot be tolerated. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=354.44s)]
*  Gabbard criticized the strikes as reckless and short-sighted. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=361.44s)]
*  A month before meeting Assad, she proposed the Stop Arming Terrorists Act, a bill she [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=366.35999999999996s)]
*  said would achieve this objective by, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=371.23999999999995s)]
*  making it illegal for any U.S. federal government funds to be used to provide assistance to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=373.52s)]
*  terrorists or to any nation that has given or continues to give assistance to terrorists, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=378.0s)]
*  and requiring the Director of National Intelligence to determine the individual and groups that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=384.0s)]
*  should be considered terrorists. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=388.56s)]
*  Our limited resources should go toward rebuilding our communities here at home, not fueling [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=390.88s)]
*  more counterproductive regime change wars abroad. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=396.44s)]
*  If confirmed by the Senate, Gabbard's powers as Director of National Intelligence would [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=400.48s)]
*  include exercising authority over the $100 billion annual U.S. spy budget, and briefing [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=404.72s)]
*  Trump on the most sensitive U.S. secrets in the president's daily brief. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=410.44s)]
*  Trump's work now includes deciding what U.S. involvement in Syria will look like going [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=415.04s)]
*  forward. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=420.0s)]
*  As Assad's regime was collapsing, he declared, this is not our fight. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=421.24s)]
*  It's one of the many reasons why I appreciate President Trump's leadership and his election [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=425.24s)]
*  where he is fully committed, as he has said over and over, to bringing about an end to [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=430.28s)]
*  wars, demonstrating peace through strength, and putting the national security interests [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=434.84s)]
*  and the safety, security, and freedom of the American people first and foremost. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY&t=440.79999999999995s)]
