# How Roblox Became a $45 Billion Public Videogame Company | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 12, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc)
*  A lot of the work you do is with blocks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the core shape for the platform. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=4.32s)]
*  Samuel Jordan has been making video games since he was 15 years old. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  I've gone from making clothing stores to 3D cafes and food restaurants to now full-fledged games. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=12.0s)]
*  He's made all of these on a free online gaming platform called Roblox, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=19.0s)]
*  which is available on desktop, mobile devices, and Xbox consoles. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=23.0s)]
*  Last year, at the age of 21, Jordan earned more than $600,000. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=27.4s)]
*  Not yet! [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=33.4s)]
*  He's among the 7 million Roblox developers who've built the company a library of over 20 million games and experiences. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=34.4s)]
*  And this has attracted about 33 million daily users, and more than half of them are under the age of 13. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=41.4s)]
*  The pandemic fueled this model, and Roblox became a place where kids at home could hang out. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=48.4s)]
*  This has made it one of the most valuable video game companies in the world. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=53.4s)]
*  And on its first day of trading in March, saw a market valuation of $45 billion. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=56.4s)]
*  But as new games are created every day, the company faces the challenge of moderating its platform. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=61.4s)]
*  And its business model writes on whether Roblox can remain a safe place for kids. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=67.4s)]
*  My daughter is obsessed with Roblox. I know this platform way too well. She loves Royale High. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=72.4s)]
*  Sarah Needleman covers the video game industry for the Wall Street Journal, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=78.4s)]
*  and she's been spending a lot of time on Roblox with her daughter. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=82.4s)]
*  I got this yesterday. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=86.4s)]
*  And even owns a copy of the Ultimate Guide to Roblox. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=88.4s)]
*  All of the games on the platform have been made by users. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=91.4s)]
*  And some are just individuals like you and I, but the company itself doesn't make the games that are on the platform. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=96.4s)]
*  This means Roblox doesn't have to rely on Hollywood-like budgets and rock star talent to produce blockbuster titles. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=103.4s)]
*  For example, one of last year's most anticipated video games was Cyberpunk 2077, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=109.4s)]
*  a game that cost Polish company CD Projekt more than $300 million to develop and market. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=114.4s)]
*  Just compare that with Roblox, which provides a free developer toolkit for anyone interested in creating content for it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=120.4s)]
*  Luckily, Roblox has a lot of these pre-made for us, so we're just going to go into our toolbox and find one. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=127.4s)]
*  You don't have to be an expert in coding to make games for Roblox. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=133.4s)]
*  There are step-by-step resources and a lot of it's drag and drop, somewhat turnkey, you could say. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=136.4s)]
*  So that has made it very attractive to younger folks who are just sort of learning how to do this stuff. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=142.4s)]
*  Roblox says it's continually updating the toolkit. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=147.4s)]
*  This helps developers make engaging content so its players don't get bored. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=150.4s)]
*  They can make higher quality games, the kind of games that adults would appreciate more so than youngsters. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=155.4s)]
*  They're more complicated, they're more challenging. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=161.4s)]
*  This creates an ecosystem of players and developers. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=163.4s)]
*  Just look at Samuel Jordan. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=166.4s)]
*  It felt just really inspiring to think, wow, at a younger age, I can make something. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=168.4s)]
*  He first started playing in 2011, and four years later, he began creating his own worlds, like Fairy Tail. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=173.4s)]
*  Yay, a new friend. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=179.4s)]
*  Today, he's building complex games for young children and even took a break from college during the pandemic to focus on Roblox with his friends. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=182.4s)]
*  Jordan was also handpicked by the company when he was 19 years old to help expand the toolkit. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=190.4s)]
*  They've also increased the amount of textures you can add in game, and it's really helped to really build an atmosphere for your games. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=195.4s)]
*  Games are free to play on Roblox, so Jordan only starts to earn money when a player spends the in-game currency called Robux. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=203.4s)]
*  Earning money on Roblox is actually a pretty easy process. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=210.4s)]
*  People will pay you with Robux, and you can exchange those out for dollars or your local currency. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=213.4s)]
*  So players can link their accounts to credit cards, and for young children, they can use prepaid gift cards. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=218.4s)]
*  With Robux, they can buy this print jacket or pay for a pass to visit the Dream Mansion. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=224.4s)]
*  Jordan also makes money from collaborations with brands, turning real-world products into Roblox items, but he doesn't get to keep all the money. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=232.4s)]
*  Developers receive 70% of the Robux spent in their games and get 30% of the Robux spent on items they put up for sale. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=240.4s)]
*  Roblox says the rest goes to running the business, including hosting services and operations. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=248.4s)]
*  As players flock to Roblox during the pandemic, the company said its revenue last year grew 82%, while sales of virtual items more than doubled to about $2 billion. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=254.4s)]
*  But user loyalty hasn't translated into profits. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=265.4s)]
*  The company has incurred net losses since its inception in 2004, and last year, those losses exceeded $250 million, in part because of higher operating costs. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=268.4s)]
*  But profitability isn't the only challenge. There's been an increasing amount of adult content on some games. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=279.4s)]
*  All the sorts of bad actors you see on social media, you would have to assume could happen on a site like Roblox. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=286.4s)]
*  The only difference is that Roblox happens to appeal to a very young audience, who is probably, youngsters are more vulnerable to bad actors than adults maybe. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=291.4s)]
*  And so it raises the bar in terms of moderation. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=300.4s)]
*  Roblox said it hired more than 2,300 content moderators, while inappropriate words are replaced with hashtags. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=304.4s)]
*  The company also said it's now developing content ratings for games and making parental controls easier to find and use. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=311.4s)]
*  But as countries emerge from the pandemic, Roblox hopes the habits of using the platform aren't easy to break. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=319.4s)]
*  Even Jordan says he'll continue to create. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=326.4s)]
*  I don't think I'm going to be chasing to keep people on past the pandemic. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=329.4s)]
*  I'm going to continue to make content I think players will enjoy, and the ones that stay along are going to be there because they enjoy the time they spend. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39x7GNm5gIc&t=333.4s)]
