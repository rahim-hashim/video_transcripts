# The Critical Coronavirus-Busting Therapies, Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI)
*  Clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines are nearing the final stretch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=0.0s)]
*  But health experts say vaccines are just one piece of a larger puzzle [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=5.0s)]
*  in fighting the deadly disease and getting us back to normal. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=9.0s)]
*  The other big piece are effective treatments for those who are already sick. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=12.0s)]
*  Not everybody mounts a good immune response. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=17.0s)]
*  In particular, immunosuppressed patients are well known to not respond well to vaccines. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=20.0s)]
*  So we are going to need to have therapies for those who are not vaccinated [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=25.0s)]
*  and for those who don't make a good immune response. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=29.0s)]
*  Right now, there are three main categories of COVID-19 treatments. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=31.0s)]
*  Antibody therapies, immunomodulators, and antivirals. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=36.0s)]
*  Antibody therapies leverage antibodies, like these, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=40.0s)]
*  that the body naturally produces after recovering from a disease. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=44.0s)]
*  To ward off infection, they attach to proteins on the virus's surface [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=48.0s)]
*  that prevents it from infiltrating cells. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=52.0s)]
*  Different types of antibodies target different parts of the virus. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=55.0s)]
*  They circulate in the yellowish liquid part of blood, known as plasma. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=59.0s)]
*  That's where the treatment comes in. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=63.0s)]
*  You can take that liquid and give it to a person who's sick or to prevent disease. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=65.0s)]
*  So it is the transfer of immunity from a person who's made it to a person who's susceptible. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=71.0s)]
*  When given to sick patients, convalescent plasma can potentially boost a person's immune response to the virus, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=77.0s)]
*  but just for a few weeks. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=83.0s)]
*  We always pull it out during a pandemic. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=85.0s)]
*  We did this for 2009 H1N1, obviously for things such as Ebola virus disease in Africa. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=87.0s)]
*  Because it's relatively easy to produce compared to vaccines and other drugs, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=93.0s)]
*  experts think it could possibly be used both as a treatment and as a preventative medicine against COVID-19. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=98.0s)]
*  It's based on the same principle of if you have a protective antibody, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=105.0s)]
*  passive transfer of that could provide not only protection prophylactically, but also treatment. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=109.0s)]
*  Plasma is widely thought to be safe, and in August, the FDA authorized using it to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=115.0s)]
*  But its effectiveness is still being studied. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=123.0s)]
*  Convalescent plasma is a little bit of a, it's a mixed bag. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=126.0s)]
*  We don't actually know the titers of the patients who have survived and done well after COVID. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=129.0s)]
*  Titers are a measurement of how many antibodies are in a person's blood. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=136.0s)]
*  Typically, the more antibodies a person has, the better chance they have at fighting an infection. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=140.0s)]
*  This means that not all plasma is created equal. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=145.0s)]
*  The amount and quality of antibodies it contains can vary. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=148.0s)]
*  That impacts how effective the treatment can be. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=152.0s)]
*  So what you're getting with convalescent plasma right now is a bit of an unknown. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=155.0s)]
*  To overcome this, scientists use plasma as a blueprint to build a more potent drug known as monoclonal antibodies. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=160.0s)]
*  They do this by homing in on specific antibodies that do the best job in stopping the virus. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=167.0s)]
*  We screened this huge panel of antibodies through many in vitro assays to select the best antibodies that block the ability of the virus to get inside cells and infect them. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=173.0s)]
*  Once they're identified, scientists can mass produce them in facilities that resemble breweries and pack them into drugs that act as a targeted attack against the virus. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=184.0s)]
*  You're growing these cells in bioreactors, which are huge steel tanks. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=194.0s)]
*  And then as the cells grow, they are pumping out antibody. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=198.0s)]
*  You are concentrating that and in purified form. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=201.0s)]
*  This is what you are administering to patients. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=204.0s)]
*  Both Regeneron and competitor Eli Lilly have been racing to bring monoclonal antibody drugs to market for COVID-19. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=206.0s)]
*  The companies are testing drugs that contain one or two types of antibodies, and researchers say they could have benefits over plasma-based treatments. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=213.0s)]
*  Monoclonal antibody preparations are consistent. They are consistent from patient to patient. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=222.0s)]
*  They can be standardized and they are hopefully easier to use than plasma because of these properties. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=227.0s)]
*  Each of the companies has released encouraging data from early stage clinical trials showing their drugs helped reduce coronavirus levels and improved symptoms in non-hospitalized patients. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=235.0s)]
*  But both drug makers had to pause their studies in hospitalized patients. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=245.0s)]
*  And the Lilly study was halted in this patient population altogether because they didn't see a benefit. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=249.0s)]
*  Early data among less severe patients, though, looks promising for both drugs. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=255.0s)]
*  In October, President Trump was given Regeneron's antibody cocktail as part of his COVID-19 treatment. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=260.0s)]
*  The president said the drug was key to his recovery, but it's unclear how beneficial the drug actually was. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=266.0s)]
*  I just want to say we have Regeneron, we have a very similar drug from Eli Lilly, and they're coming out and we're trying to get them on an emergency basis. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=272.0s)]
*  Both Regeneron and Lilly have asked the FDA to authorize emergency use of their treatments. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=282.0s)]
*  We have committed to manufacturing about 300,000 doses of these antibodies by the end of this year. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=288.0s)]
*  And we have also partnered with Roe so that we can scale up and produce about two million doses of these antibodies to be available annually for worldwide use. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=293.0s)]
*  But physicians have expressed concerns about these new drugs. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=303.0s)]
*  This isn't the type of drug that is always able to be scaled, that can be made available to everyone rapidly, and also is a low cost. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=306.0s)]
*  Experts say both plasma and monoclonal antibody treatments could help not just COVID-19 patients, but also help prevent infection in healthy people. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=317.0s)]
*  To treat patients, doctors have also been using immunomodulators. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=326.0s)]
*  These drugs suppress the immune system and ensuing inflammation in the sickest of COVID-19 patients. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=330.0s)]
*  That's important because this inflammation can be deadly. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=336.0s)]
*  One of those drugs is the steroid dexamethasone. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=339.0s)]
*  Researchers have found that it improved survival when given to severely ill patients. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=343.0s)]
*  The other treatment being used to fight COVID-19 is the antiviral drug remdesivir. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=348.0s)]
*  This was another drug the president was given at Walter Reed Hospital. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=353.0s)]
*  So we really try to give remdesivir as soon as somebody may be admitted to the hospital. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=357.0s)]
*  We want to give it as early as possible. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=362.0s)]
*  We know from Tamiflu and the flu and all those kind of different drugs that giving antivirals sooner rather than later is really important. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=364.0s)]
*  Here's how it stops the coronavirus. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=371.0s)]
*  When a virus infects a cell, it uses the cell's machinery to build more viruses. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=373.0s)]
*  It does that by making copies of its RNA. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=378.0s)]
*  That's the genetic material that contains instructions for replication. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=381.0s)]
*  Remdesivir is designed to infiltrate these instructions by inserting itself into copies of the virus's genetic code. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=385.0s)]
*  This interrupts the replication process and acts as a kill switch for the virus. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=392.0s)]
*  Promising clinical trials led to the drug being approved for emergency use in May. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=397.0s)]
*  But more recent studies have produced conflicting results about its ability to speed up recovery and curb death in COVID-19 patients. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=402.0s)]
*  The Department of Health and Human Services allowed drugmaker Gilead to market the drug directly to hospitals in October. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=410.0s)]
*  And the CEO said he was confident in being able to deliver the drug to the patients who need it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=417.0s)]
*  We now have enough supply of this medicine for patients in the United States and globally by the end of this month. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=422.0s)]
*  There's been tremendous progress in treating COVID-19, but health experts caution that there is still more work to be done to see just how effective these treatments are. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=429.0s)]
*  And to save lives, doctors will need a multitude of drugs at their disposal. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=438.0s)]
*  I think that we're going to see many more therapeutics come out by the end of this pandemic. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=442.0s)]
*  And so that people that enter the hospital will at least receive one specific COVID-19 treatment for their disease. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=446.0s)]
*  Experts say these three types of treatments are promising. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=454.0s)]
*  And they are hopeful that therapeutic drugs combined with the vaccine may finally put up an effective defense against the pandemic. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7jV5YcrdI&t=458.0s)]
