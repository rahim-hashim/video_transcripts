# How to Read the Jobs Report  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU)
*  There's been a lot of press coverage about people quitting their jobs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, today's report tells you why. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=3.36s)]
*  Here, President Biden is referring to the Labor Department's monthly jobs report, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=6.12s)]
*  a key gauge of American employment and inflation. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=11.08s)]
*  The report can move trillions of dollars in market trades [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=14.56s)]
*  and influence policy decisions like interest rates at the Federal Reserve. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=17.84s)]
*  But the report still has its limits. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  There are some things that the jobs report doesn't include, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=24.64s)]
*  and because of that, we're not getting a complete picture of the U.S. jobs market. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=27.56s)]
*  Here's what you need to know to read the monthly jobs report, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  including what it tells you and what it doesn't. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=35.44s)]
*  The report, which is normally released on the first Friday of the month, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=41.48s)]
*  gives a look at the current state of the economy. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=45.2s)]
*  And while economists read it in depth, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=47.92s)]
*  there are four key areas that they tend to focus on. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=50.12s)]
*  Non-farm payrolls, often simply referred to as jobs, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=53.32s)]
*  shows the number of positions added or lost each month that aren't in agriculture. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=56.8s)]
*  This chart shows non-farm payrolls over the past decade. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  You can see job numbers had been steadily rising until the pandemic hit when they plummeted. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=65.72s)]
*  And although jobs had started to recover, by late 2021, job growth had slowed. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=71.52s)]
*  Weak job growth can be a reflection of two different things. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=76.84s)]
*  One is that businesses are struggling to find workers, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=81.36s)]
*  which is largely what we saw in 2021. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=85.92s)]
*  Sarah Cheney-Cambon reports on the American labor market for The Wall Street Journal. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=88.56s)]
*  The other is that demand for their goods and services is weak, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  and therefore they're waiting off workers or not hiring. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=97.56s)]
*  This fluctuating jobs number is directly tied to the unemployment rate, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=101.28s)]
*  which measures how many workers in the labor force are unemployed and currently looking for work. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=105.24s)]
*  The goal is full employment, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  which some economists say is around a 4% to 5% unemployment rate. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=111.84s)]
*  Full employment is basically when anyone who wants a job can get a job. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=116.6s)]
*  When the unemployment rate is really low, it's generally a good thing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=122.56s)]
*  It means that businesses are not waiting off workers, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=127.12s)]
*  and wages are probably growing pretty strongly as a result of low joblessness. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=130.8s)]
*  But if unemployment drops too low, it can signal challenges. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  The downside of low unemployment can be that companies are really struggling to find workers, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  and that can lead to them raising wages and therefore prices, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=147.84s)]
*  and you could get very big inflationary pressures. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=152.56s)]
*  When the unemployment rate goes down, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=156.44s)]
*  economists look into how much of that is due to workers getting jobs, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  and how much is due to shrinking labor force participation, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=162.32s)]
*  which is measured by the labor force participation rate, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=165.76s)]
*  or how much of the overall population is either currently working or looking for a job. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=168.92s)]
*  You can see labor force participation has steadily declined over the past two decades, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  with the largest drop happening at the beginning of the pandemic. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=179.56s)]
*  And when the rate drops too low, it can put pressure on employers. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=182.67999999999998s)]
*  Generally, when the labor force participation rate is low, as it's been throughout the pandemic, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=186.32s)]
*  you might see stronger wage growth, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=193.16s)]
*  and that's because businesses just can't find the workers to fill their jobs. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=195.32s)]
*  They're oftentimes facing what we call labor shortages, and as a result, they ramp up pay. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=200.4s)]
*  Increasing or decreasing pay is measured by wage growth. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=206.88s)]
*  Look at this chart. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=211.12s)]
*  You'll notice that wages picked up in 2021 due to labor shortages, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=212.36s)]
*  and economists expect that wages will continue to rise. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=216.52s)]
*  Metrics like wage growth give economists a sense of how the economy is doing, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=220.4s)]
*  but the data only shows part of the picture. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=225.0s)]
*  That's because the report is mainly just hard data, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=227.44s)]
*  which means it can tell us whether job numbers and wages are going up or down, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  but it doesn't explain why. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=234.28s)]
*  It doesn't give us details on how good a given job is. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=236.24s)]
*  It doesn't tell us how safe a manufacturing job is, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=239.84s)]
*  or how well an employer is treating their employees. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=243.36s)]
*  And there's also the timing of the report. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  It's based on two core surveys from the Labor Department. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=249.72s)]
*  One of household populations and another of employment data [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=253.24s)]
*  that take place around the 12th of every month. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  And as a result, the jobs report primarily reflects the labor market over these first two weeks, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=259.12s)]
*  which means there's a delay in the data. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=264.76s)]
*  The employment survey collects data from around 145,000 employers, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  some of whom may respond to the survey late or not at all. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=272.12s)]
*  Before the pandemic hit, businesses were open, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=275.72s)]
*  and so they were able to provide responses to the Labor Department survey. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=279.12s)]
*  After the pandemic hit, a lot of businesses shut down, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=284.56s)]
*  either because consumers stopped going to ex-restaurants or ex-business, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=288.24s)]
*  or because of government-mandated restrictions. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=294.12s)]
*  If businesses don't respond, the Labor Department has to guess their payroll size, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=297.36s)]
*  which can get tricky. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=301.68s)]
*  And this is what we saw happening during the pandemic. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=302.96s)]
*  The Labor Department had a smaller sample size of businesses to work with for its payroll survey. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=305.64000000000004s)]
*  And as a result, the margin of error when they were making calculations was higher. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  This margin of error is important, in part, because of just how big the labor market is. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=316.6s)]
*  In December 2021, it stood at almost 150 million jobs. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=322.56s)]
*  If the number of jobs added or lost are tens of thousands higher or lower than what the report shows, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=327.40000000000003s)]
*  it could make policymakers' jobs harder. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=332.88s)]
*  The Federal Reserve is really closely watching those job growth and payroll growth numbers. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=335.16s)]
*  And if there's a big margin of error, they might have a slight misunderstanding of what's going on. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=341.20000000000005s)]
*  Still, the Fed looks at multiple data reports about the economy. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=346.48s)]
*  And over time, estimates from the jobs report that are too high or low tend to even out, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=350.48s)]
*  so the implications are shorter term. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=355.64000000000004s)]
*  But despite the pitfalls, the jobs report is still one of the most influential indicators we have [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=357.68s)]
*  for the American workforce and economy. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztO1SdIkaU&t=363.6s)]
