# How Jet Fuel Is Made From Trash | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU)
*  You can see how white and fluffy this material is. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=0.0s)]
*  Trash. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=4.34s)]
*  Sorted, shredded, and piled into heaps. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=5.34s)]
*  But when United Airlines looks at this garbage, it sees jet fuel. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=8.44s)]
*  Or more specifically, sustainable aviation fuel, known as SAF, which many see as the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=13.6s)]
*  key to decarbonizing aviation. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=18.52s)]
*  But there's a supply problem. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=21.38s)]
*  Producers made about 15.8 million gallons of SAF last year in the U.S. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=23.16s)]
*  Major in U.S. Airlines used about 17.5 billion gallons of jet fuel. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=27.8s)]
*  We don't have the solution commercially available at scale to really make a difference right [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=33.2s)]
*  now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=39.16s)]
*  But we do know what that solution is, and it's sustainable aviation fuel. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=40.16s)]
*  So airlines and the government are now pumping money into the low-carbon fuel sector, investing [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=43.56s)]
*  millions in projects like SAF produced from trash to get this nascent industry off the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=48.44s)]
*  ground. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=52.88s)]
*  But will it take off? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=53.88s)]
*  The aviation industry alone accounted for more than 2% of global emissions in 2021, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=57.8s)]
*  and its share of the pie is expected to grow. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=63.28s)]
*  Unlike the auto industry, which is moving away from fossil fuels to battery power, commercial [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=66.12s)]
*  jets still need liquid fuel to fly. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=70.92s)]
*  If you look at our greenhouse gas footprint as an airline, a commercial airline, 98% of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=74.36s)]
*  the emissions that we create and put into the atmosphere are from the use of fuel. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  SAF is what's called a drop-in solution because it can drop in in place of petroleum fuel. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=86.2s)]
*  It doesn't require new infrastructure or even new planes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=91.92s)]
*  The SAF on the market today can cut emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=95.76s)]
*  In Sparks, Nevada, Fulcrum Bioenergy is working on a fuel with a bigger promise. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=102.28s)]
*  We produce a fuel product that has zero net impact on carbon emissions. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=107.08s)]
*  It starts with trash. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=112.36s)]
*  We get 350,000 tons of it each year. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=113.96s)]
*  After sorting out things like rocks and metals, the leftover garbage is made into that confetti-like [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  material. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  There's paper, there's wrappings, there's plastic shreddings. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  It's the feedstock for Fulcrum's fuel. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=127.32s)]
*  All of this material, what you're seeing in this warehouse here, will convert into about [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  100,000 gallons of transportation fuel. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=135.56s)]
*  But getting from this to fuel isn't simple. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=139.04s)]
*  Taking that feedstock is the first part of the process. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=142.48s)]
*  The next stage of the process is what you see here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  Taking that feedstock with the white conveyors going up to the top of this first gasification [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  tower, beginning the process of transforming that feedstock into usable gases. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=153.88s)]
*  It's a three-stage gasification process. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=159.56s)]
*  What you're looking at here is the first stage. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  The process creates carbon monoxide and hydrogen molecules, known as syngas, which is then [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=165.32s)]
*  and sent through this Fischer-Tropsch system. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=170.92s)]
*  But here, those gases are actually converted into a liquid transportation fuel that can [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=173.2s)]
*  be sold to refineries or ultimately will be modifying and upgrading into jet fuel. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=178.96s)]
*  Fulcrum opened this facility, its first commercial-scale plant, last year. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=186.68s)]
*  And it says it will produce 11 million gallons of its synthetic crude oil product here by [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=190.52s)]
*  next year. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=194.64s)]
*  United, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, and others have already signed offtake agreements [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=196.28s)]
*  with Fulcrum that could see the company deliver 290 million gallons of its fuel annually. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=200.92s)]
*  It really is all about supply. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=206.44s)]
*  I mean, let's call it what it is. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=208.28s)]
*  There's not a lack of demand for low-carbon SAF. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=210.12s)]
*  Which is why, outside of Fulcrum's Nevada plant, 25 SAF production refineries are now [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=213.88s)]
*  planned or open in the U.S. alone. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=218.44s)]
*  United is already pumping a blend of jet fuel and SAF onto its flights here out of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=223.44s)]
*  Los Angeles, as well as San Francisco and Amsterdam airports. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=228.28s)]
*  In 2022, it used 3 million gallons of SAF. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=232.96s)]
*  This year, it expects that to hit 10 million. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=236.24s)]
*  But United has a goal of net zero emissions by 2050. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=239.32s)]
*  Overall, I need 4 billion gallons of fuel. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=243.32s)]
*  So if we're talking about 10 million gallons of SAF, it is far less than 0.1% of my total [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=246.72s)]
*  fuel supply, which is really where we get to the crux of the issue. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=251.84s)]
*  How do we generate more production? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=255.96s)]
*  How do we create more supply so that it's not less than 0.1% of my fuel? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=257.68s)]
*  Earlier this year, the airline launched the more than $100 million fund to invest in startups [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=262.24s)]
*  looking for new ways to produce SAF from feedstocks including alcohol, forest waste, and of course, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=266.92s)]
*  trash. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=272.64s)]
*  It even enlisted Oscar the Grouch to draw attention to the effort. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=273.64s)]
*  Trash like this could be used for good? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=277.28s)]
*  If SAF is going to make its way into the market on a more broad-based, a more commonly used [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=280.84s)]
*  approach, it's going to have to be new feedstock sources that unleash larger volumes. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  The SAF being pumped today relies on used cooking oil and animal fats as its feedstock. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=294.32s)]
*  Vegetable oils, fats, waste oils, greases are also used for fuels for the on-road transportation [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  sector. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  The same feedstocks are used for biodiesel and renewable diesel. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=309.72s)]
*  So there's competition. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  About 6 million metric tons of used cooking oil and 27 million metric tons of animal fats [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=315.88000000000005s)]
*  are traded globally every year, which would cover only around 5% of jet fuel consumption. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  There is not enough used cooking oil in the world to fuel aviation. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  That is true. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=331.26000000000005s)]
*  But when you start looking at the second generation around trash, around residue from the forest, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=332.26000000000005s)]
*  from ethanol, we have 17 billion gallons of ethanol in the U.S. alone. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=338.28s)]
*  There is plenty of feedstock there. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=343.47999999999996s)]
*  It's a question of how do you get the feedstock to the right production location so that you [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=345.32s)]
*  can actually create sustainable aviation fuels with a low carbon footprint. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=349.96s)]
*  At least 30 airlines have promised to use SAF, usually for 10% of their fuel consumption [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=354.76s)]
*  by 2030. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=360.08s)]
*  And the Biden administration has set a goal of scaling U.S. SAF production to 3 billion [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=361.08s)]
*  gallons per year by then too. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=366.12s)]
*  S&P Global Projections show the country won't quite hit that, but it will scale to more [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=368.32s)]
*  than 2 billion gallons a year by the target date. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=372.92s)]
*  We certainly see the framework and we certainly see the corporate community taking steps in [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=376.04s)]
*  order to increase domestic SAF production. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  And so even if mandates are not being met, progress is certainly being made. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=386.56s)]
*  Then there's the issue of cost. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  SAF is typically two to four times more expensive than regular fuel. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  Airlines have tight margins and customers are always looking for the best price. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=399.6s)]
*  And it's uncertain how much tolerance consumers have for increased prices by using biofuels. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=406.20000000000005s)]
*  The Inflation Reduction Act set aside about $300 million for low-emissions aviation technologies [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  plus $500 million for biofuels. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=418.52000000000004s)]
*  The Inflation Reduction Act also established two separate tax credits for SAF to help bring [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=421.64000000000004s)]
*  its cost per gallon closer to conventional fuel. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=424.88s)]
*  The IRA was a game changer. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=428.44s)]
*  A game changer. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=431.6s)]
*  It actually put sustainable aviation fuels on the map. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=432.6s)]
*  This was really a signal to the market, to producers, that the government is committed [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=435.20000000000005s)]
*  to building a market for sustainable aviation fuels and it is backing this as the pathway [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=439.72s)]
*  to decarbonize aviation. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=444.88s)]
*  And while experts say more incentives are also needed, the industry is now flying with [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=447.24s)]
*  some wind at its back. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=451.88s)]
*  SAF is having a moment and that moment is going to continue for a very long time. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Du7tKWtseU&t=453.64s)]
