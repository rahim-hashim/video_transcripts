Video Description: Italy’s parliament has finally approved a plan to build the world’s longest suspension bridge between Sicily and the mainland, an area prone to 170 mph winds, powerful riptides and earthquakes.

This suspension bridge across the Strait of Messina will be 2.2 miles long and include two gigantic towers, each 100 feet taller than New York’s Empire State Building. The project could employ 100,000 people in the area and help revitalize Italy’s economically struggling south.  

WSJ explains Italy’s technical plans for the bridge, and the engineering developments that may make it feasible.

# Engineer Explains How the World’s Longest Suspension Bridge Will Be Built  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank)
*  For decades, Italian engineers have been working on designs for a massive project. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=0.0s)]
*  One that could help solve one of southern Italy's biggest problems. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=6.0s)]
*  By connecting 5 million people in Sicily to the mainland. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Bringing jobs and growth to the economically depressed southern regions. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=13.36s)]
*  The final goal? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=18.12s)]
*  A $12.7 billion mega-project called the Messina Straight Bridge. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=19.12s)]
*  Which, if completed, will be the world's longest suspension bridge. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=23.84s)]
*  Nobody has ever built such a big bridge. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=28.16s)]
*  So it is an incredible challenge. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=30.92s)]
*  Building a bridge that's more than two miles long, in an area with gale force winds [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=33.44s)]
*  and frequent earthquakes, is neither easy nor cheap. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=37.76s)]
*  Here's how Italy plans to pull it off. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=41.32s)]
*  To understand why this straight is so dangerous, here's a look at the tectonic fault lines [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=45.24s)]
*  in the Mediterranean. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  Experts say this line, which runs right under the proposed bridge, is where the Eurasian [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  and African tectonic plates meet. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=56.4s)]
*  Notoriously active, it caused a 7.5 magnitude quake in 1908. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  And one 50 years later, which reached 6.1 magnitude. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=64.32s)]
*  The fault line also created this narrow corridor. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=68.56s)]
*  When winds from the south funnel into it, they pick up speed as they're squeezed into [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=71.96s)]
*  less space, at times reaching up to 170 miles per hour. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=76.14s)]
*  Winds like this can be devastating for bridges. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=80.72s)]
*  In 1940, the Tacoma Narrows suspension bridge in Washington famously collapsed in high winds. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=83.6s)]
*  At the time, it was the third longest suspension bridge in the world. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=89.46s)]
*  So how are engineers planning to tackle these challenges? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=93.44s)]
*  We visited Columbia's engineering lab to learn more. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=98.11999999999999s)]
*  This is Raimundo Berri, a suspension bridge expert. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  He consulted on the Messina Bridge's early designs in the 90s. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  He says that a suspension bridge gets its stability from cables that attach the deck [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  to sets of towers supported with vertical struts. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=112.32s)]
*  So when you have a car going over this bridge, the car is on the deck. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=115.88s)]
*  Then the deck transfers this load through the suspender to the main cable. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  The main cable distributes the load to the towers and to the anchorages. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=126.33999999999999s)]
*  The Messina Bridge will be held up by two gigantic towers, each 60 feet taller than [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=132.72s)]
*  the Empire State Building. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=137.72s)]
*  The deck will be 2.2 miles long and take about 10 minutes to cross by car, making it [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=139.58s)]
*  over 50% longer than the current record holder, the 6,637-foot-long Kanakale Bridge in Turkey. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=144.82000000000002s)]
*  Messina is over three kilometers free span. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=152.54000000000002s)]
*  So now you are pushing the envelope not just a few meters, but you are pushing the envelope [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=156.24s)]
*  of about almost a kilometer. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=163.78s)]
*  While that jump in length is a construction challenge, it's also a solution to one of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=167.0s)]
*  those big environmental dangers. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=171.34s)]
*  Experts say that extra kilometer of deck will help protect the bridge from seismic activity. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=175.46s)]
*  Imagine this piece of balsa wood is a bridge deck. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=180.18s)]
*  This cross section is this long, okay? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=182.98s)]
*  If I take this piece instead and I bend it, this one is much more flexible because it [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=187.22s)]
*  is much more longer. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=193.94s)]
*  The idea is that, in an earthquake, the deck will bend slowly, registering less seismic [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=196.16s)]
*  activity like a large ship in small waves. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=201.22s)]
*  Moving upward, one of the bridge's newest engineering developments is these hourglass-shaped [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=205.42s)]
*  struts. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=210.06s)]
*  They let the legs flex more than a traditional cross-shaped strut when there's a quake. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=211.06s)]
*  Between the flexible deck and legs, the bridge could theoretically withstand a 7.5 magnitude [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=216.94s)]
*  earthquake, the highest of any structure in the world. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=222.34s)]
*  Seismic is going to be important, but seismic, we know how to design for seismic. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=226.1s)]
*  The major concern, in my opinion, for these bridges is the wind. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  On a bridge, strong winds can look like this. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=236.32s)]
*  You might have excessive motion of these bridges way left and right, left and right, that impairs [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  the traffic. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=246.48s)]
*  That people say, I'm not going there. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=247.48s)]
*  So to prevent that, engineers created a new kind of deck, the Massena-type deck. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=250.74s)]
*  This cross-section shows. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=255.64s)]
*  Three box girders. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=257.38s)]
*  The two others were for vehicular traffic. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=259.3s)]
*  The inner one was for train traffic. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=262.82s)]
*  And then these box girders are connected by a very tight skin of crossbars. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=265.74s)]
*  All these lanes and tracks will be capable of supporting up to 6,000 cars per hour and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  200 trains per day. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=279.08s)]
*  And see how the side girders are tapered? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=280.86s)]
*  The crosswind will kind of move over like an airplane wing and will not create too much [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=283.18s)]
*  excessive motion. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=289.74s)]
*  Principles of the deck, which have been developed over the course of decades, have been tested [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=291.78000000000003s)]
*  in recent years. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=295.68s)]
*  The Chianallagi bridge uses similar principle, but it does not have the center one because [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  it does not carry any train. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=302.94s)]
*  The Massena bridge, this is another challenge. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=305.0s)]
*  Has been done for two, but now you have to make it three box girder. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=308.54s)]
*  With this deck, engineers say the bridge could stay standing with winds up to 186 miles an [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=312.84s)]
*  hour. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=318.11999999999995s)]
*  That's as fast as the top wind speeds of a category five hurricane. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=319.11999999999995s)]
*  But the high cost isn't the only challenge to completion. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=323.71999999999997s)]
*  Critics have highlighted research that high numbers of migrating birds could collide with [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=327.23999999999995s)]
*  the bridge. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=331.44s)]
*  Experts say that could be devastating to endangered species. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=332.88s)]
*  And there's even concern that the mafia could influence construction contracts, inflating [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  costs and adding risk. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=340.5s)]
*  Currently officials plan to break ground in mid 2024 and finish the bridge in the early [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=343.66s)]
*  2030s. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=348.7s)]
*  So for now, this new world's longest suspension bridge is still a decade away. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrVqLbVRank&t=350.3s)]
