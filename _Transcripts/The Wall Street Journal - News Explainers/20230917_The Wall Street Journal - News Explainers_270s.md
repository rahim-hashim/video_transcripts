# UFOs: What Mysteries Could NASA’s New UAP Report Help Solve? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w)
*  Oh my gosh, dude. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=0.0s)]
*  Wow, look at that. Look at that. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=1.6s)]
*  Government officials can't answer this naval pilot's question. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=4.24s)]
*  With current data, they can deduce just a few things about this mystery dot. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=7.68s)]
*  Based off of how high it is off the water and how fast it's likely going, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=12.32s)]
*  it's probably drifting on the wind. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=16.32s)]
*  And it's brighter than the ocean it's floating above, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  so it's likely colder than the water and not using a propulsion system. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=20.48s)]
*  So it's probably not a spaceship. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=24.64s)]
*  But because data is so limited, it makes this a UAP, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=27.2s)]
*  an unidentified anomalous phenomena. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=30.64s)]
*  Identifying UAP is so important because it's a matter of national security, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  it's a matter of aviation safety, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=37.36s)]
*  and it's incredibly important that we're curious about our world around us. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=38.96s)]
*  Here's why these objects are so hard to identify [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=42.16s)]
*  and how a new report from NASA could help solve some of these mysteries. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=44.8s)]
*  Ryan Graves is a former naval F-18 pilot who has been an advocate for researching [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=50.0s)]
*  unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs, after witnessing one himself. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=54.96s)]
*  That was very surreal to see that because we immediately thought it was a radar error. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=60.0s)]
*  But it's almost more unsettling when the thing you thought was an error turned out to be reality. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=65.04s)]
*  A new report from an independent study team appointed by NASA [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=69.92s)]
*  is trying to make it easier to identify some of these objects. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=73.36s)]
*  But the current data available makes it a challenge. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=76.56s)]
*  Lack of data was a problem in identifying this UAP in the Middle East. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=79.84s)]
*  While we are still looking at it, I don't have any more data other than that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  One problem is the quality of images. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  Right now, many are taken from military aircrafts. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=90.8s)]
*  It's often grainy footage where it's kind of hard to tell, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=94.08s)]
*  and it's like split-second objects, small spherical object [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  that might go across the video extremely fast. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  For example, look at this one from South Asia. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=105.11999999999999s)]
*  Officials determined that this is likely just a commercial aircraft. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=107.36s)]
*  But compression on the video creates trails around it, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=110.88s)]
*  and the quality makes it hard to discern what it is. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  But it's difficult to get higher-quality footage. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=118.08s)]
*  Advanced radars like those from NOAA and NASA aren't currently watching for these objects. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=120.96s)]
*  There is not a mission to go proactively look for these right now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=126.96s)]
*  So what's happening is people that are operating these tools [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=130.72s)]
*  are seeing things that they can't explain, they have no way to report it, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=133.92s)]
*  but they're starting to now, and we're starting to see that information come in. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=136.72s)]
*  The All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or AERO, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=140.24s)]
*  heads up most efforts to identify UAPs right now, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=143.84s)]
*  but doesn't always have access to the wealth of data from places like NASA, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  the FAA, and commercial agencies. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  So this wasn't something that people were looking to develop these ways of sharing information [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=153.28s)]
*  because it wasn't on their radar. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  But now it is for agencies like NASA and for the DoD, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  and so now they're trying to work more together [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=164.4s)]
*  so that the government has a way to look at this stuff in one central place. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=167.6s)]
*  But one of the biggest barriers isn't a technological problem, it's a social one. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=172.0s)]
*  Do I believe there's life in a universe that is so vast [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=177.04s)]
*  that it's hard for me to comprehend how big it is? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=182.4s)]
*  My personal answer is yes. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=187.68s)]
*  Talking openly about UAPs or other unidentified objects [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=189.92s)]
*  hasn't always been the norm. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=193.92s)]
*  Just because of what the perception was in pop culture about UFOs, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=195.6s)]
*  a lot of people felt like if they were to come forward [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  and talk about what they would see, it would hurt them in certain ways. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=203.92s)]
*  Speculation about aliens is often brought up in conversations about identifying UAPs. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=206.64s)]
*  We need to move into the realm of science on this [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=212.16s)]
*  and make this a normal, everyday, mundane, scientific topic [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=215.92s)]
*  that we can engage in outside of controversy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=219.04s)]
*  The NASA-appointed team says that none of the UAPs they've identified so far [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=221.76s)]
*  suggest that they have extraterrestrial origins, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=226.0s)]
*  and that should only be a hypothesis of last resort. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=228.72s)]
*  The report also says that stigma around this topic [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  has prevented a lot of data from being reported. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=235.04s)]
*  The team concluded that NASA's involvement could help lend credibility to the issue [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=238.16s)]
*  and reduce stigma. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=242.39999999999998s)]
*  The agency appointed a director of UAP research, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=243.6s)]
*  a sign of its investment in the issue. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=246.88s)]
*  They're extremely well respected. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=248.88s)]
*  They have a great mind trust at NASA, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=250.24s)]
*  and they can apply a lot of intellectual force to this problem. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  So I think them coming into the game should be, I'll say, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=256.32s)]
*  a big win for transparency and for better understanding this issue. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKnXUlwdG6w&t=259.84s)]
