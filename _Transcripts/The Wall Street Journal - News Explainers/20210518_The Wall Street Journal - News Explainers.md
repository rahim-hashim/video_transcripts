# How Vulnerable Is U.S. Energy Infrastructure to Future Cyberattacks?  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 18, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk)
*  In early May, gas prices, which were already rising due to lifted pandemic restrictions, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=0.0s)]
*  shot up. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=5.84s)]
*  And it had a lot to do with this. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=6.84s)]
*  The biggest fuel pipeline system in the United States. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=9.28s)]
*  Forced to shut down. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=12.16s)]
*  A suspected cyber attack. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=13.16s)]
*  A cyber extortion attempt. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=14.72s)]
*  On May 7th, the nation's largest fuel pipeline, Colonial, shut down for six days in response [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=16.8s)]
*  to a ransomware attack that targeted the company's networks. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=22.72s)]
*  We have efforts underway with the FBI and DOJ, the Department of Justice, to disrupt [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=26.24s)]
*  and prosecute ransomware criminals. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=31.52s)]
*  The attack drove panic consumers to stockpile fuel in states heavily impacted by the shutdown. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=35.04s)]
*  Like North and South Carolina, Georgia and Virginia. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  This caused long lines and shortages at gas stations. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=43.92s)]
*  The Colonial pipeline cyber attack was the latest high profile event to expose a threat [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=47.44s)]
*  to aging vulnerable energy infrastructure in the U.S. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=52.28s)]
*  So just how vulnerable are we to future attacks? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=56.12s)]
*  Our energy infrastructure is under attack and has been under attack for at least two [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=60.76s)]
*  decades now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=67.56s)]
*  So both from a physical perspective, but also digital. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=68.56s)]
*  Teresa Payton is a cybersecurity expert and former White House chief information officer [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=72.72s)]
*  under the Bush administration. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=77.84s)]
*  She says that the energy infrastructure that fuels the U.S. is highly vulnerable to attacks [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=79.48s)]
*  like this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=84.4s)]
*  The country has around two and a half million miles of fuel pipelines. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=85.8s)]
*  And Colonial is a major part of this network, stretching from Texas to New Jersey. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  Each pipeline includes hundreds of thousands of devices, sensors for readings, valves that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=95.0s)]
*  help control flow and pressure, and leak detection systems. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=100.16s)]
*  Security experts say that all are at risk in an attack. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=104.24s)]
*  While most equipment isn't directly connected to the internet, the concern is that hackers [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=107.36s)]
*  can penetrate digitized tools or computer networks, working their way into broader systems. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=111.66000000000001s)]
*  Cyber criminals will often infiltrate systems through remote platform hacking, email phishing [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=117.10000000000001s)]
*  schemes or through compromised employee credentials. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=122.26s)]
*  Once they penetrate IT, they study the traffic of the accounts on the network and they learn [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  how to hide in plain sight. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=131.9s)]
*  I liken it to somebody who may be using rush hour traffic to basically hide their car among [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=133.66s)]
*  hundreds and thousands of vehicles in rush hour. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=142.34s)]
*  It's hard to pick out the bad actor when they're just kind of going with the flow of the traffic. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=145.66s)]
*  Once hackers are inside, they can use malicious code to lock up systems or steal sensitive [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=151.26s)]
*  information to extort their victims. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=156.9s)]
*  And these type of cyber attacks can have far reaching effects. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=159.72s)]
*  You have seen after hurricanes where that has taken part of our energy infrastructure [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=163.38s)]
*  offline and sort of what the downstream impacts are for weeks and months afterwards. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=169.98s)]
*  And so a cyber incident can have the same or even more devastating effects on our energy [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  ecosystem. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=184.66s)]
*  So why are the nation's most critical energy systems so exposed to cyber crime? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=186.14s)]
*  Peyton says that as older systems are updated and digitized, they've become more complex, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=191.5s)]
*  which hackers have taken advantage of. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=196.94s)]
*  We're integrating 5G technology, smart grid technology, sort of alternative and renewable [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=199.18s)]
*  sustainable energy sources. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=206.54000000000002s)]
*  And each time you layer on these new technologies, these new technologies are unproven as far [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=208.98000000000002s)]
*  as how they will stand up to a cyber attack. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=216.58s)]
*  In the U.S., there's also high demand for energy to always be on and working, which [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=220.3s)]
*  makes it difficult for systems to be updated. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=225.22s)]
*  Replacing outdated systems is also expensive and time consuming. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=228.5s)]
*  But it's not just aging infrastructure and a lack of resources that expose energy systems [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=233.02s)]
*  to cyber attacks. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=238.36s)]
*  Experts say that hackers are becoming increasingly organized within the ransomware industry. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=240.9s)]
*  They'll use a combination of burner phones, dark web forums, using handles in Reddit, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=246.1s)]
*  using code words when they're trying to recruit people. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=252.02s)]
*  And with more and more Silicon Valley companies rolling out encryption built in as part of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=255.9s)]
*  messaging platforms, it makes it simpler for them to just use commercially available tools. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=263.46s)]
*  After a successful attack, cyber criminals can demand payment in cryptocurrency, which [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=269.74s)]
*  limits the ability of law enforcement to track them. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=274.94s)]
*  There's also been a growth in insurance policies that cover ransomware payments, which [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=278.06s)]
*  could help boost the illegal industry. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=282.5s)]
*  Experts say attacks like the one on the Colonial Pipeline are becoming more frequent. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=285.66s)]
*  In 2020, energy companies suffered the third largest number of cyber attacks of any industry, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=290.98s)]
*  up from ninth place the previous year. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=297.22s)]
*  But there's only a patchwork of cybersecurity regulations for energy companies. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=299.7s)]
*  And the pipeline sector is largely unregulated. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=304.34000000000003s)]
*  On May 10th, President Biden said that his administration was pursuing a global effort [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=308.1s)]
*  to protect American companies and infrastructure from ransomware attacks. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=313.14s)]
*  It begins with a 100-day sprint to improve cybersecurity in the electric sector. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=316.5s)]
*  And we'll follow that with similar initiatives in natural gas pipelines, water and other [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=323.66s)]
*  sectors. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=327.86s)]
*  In addition to companies stepping up, we need to invest to safeguard our critical infrastructure. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=329.06s)]
*  The Colonial Pipeline started to resume operations on May 12th. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=335.9s)]
*  But experts say the cyber attack should still serve as a wake-up call for the energy industry. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AJlzADRLk&t=339.78000000000003s)]
