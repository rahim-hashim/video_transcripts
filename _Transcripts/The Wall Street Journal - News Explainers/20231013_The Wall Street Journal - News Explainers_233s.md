Video Description: NASA launched a spacecraft on Friday to study the Psyche asteroid, which is believed to be made out of metal. The rocky inner planets of our solar system are thought to have mostly metallic cores. 

WSJ breaks down why this mission matters and what it could tell us about Earth’s origins.

# Why NASA Is Spending Over $1B to Study This Asteroid | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E)
*  The rocky inner planets of our solar system are thought to have mostly metallic cores, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=0.0s)]
*  a building block of planet formation. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=5.32s)]
*  But because the cores are so difficult to reach, scientists can only speculate on their [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=7.94s)]
*  exact composition and what stories they might tell us about the origins of our planets. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=12.68s)]
*  But that's about to change. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=18.06s)]
*  Vehicles pitching downrange. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=21.2s)]
*  This is the first time NASA has ever sent a mission to this type of world, the mostly [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=31.04s)]
*  metal world. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=34.78s)]
*  Here's a look at a NASA mission to the asteroid Psyche, what scientists think is a metallic [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=35.78s)]
*  core from a planet that never formed, and how the mission could tell us more about the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=40.36s)]
*  origins of planet Earth. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  More than one million asteroids have been discovered in our solar system. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=47.18s)]
*  Of those millions, Psyche was the 16th to be discovered, dating back to the mid-1800s. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=50.88s)]
*  Most asteroids are made of rock and ice, but scientists believe the Psyche asteroid, named [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=56.96s)]
*  after the Greek goddess of the soul, is made of metal. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=61.72s)]
*  In the earliest days of our solar system, about 4.5 billion years ago, there were a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=65.0s)]
*  lot of objects made of metal and rock and ice that were violently colliding together, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=69.2s)]
*  some of them accreted to form the cores and outer layers of our planets like Earth and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=74.78s)]
*  Mars. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  The best theory so far is that Psyche is one of the sort of exposed cores of these planetesimals, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  these planets that never came to be. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=86.56s)]
*  But until the Psyche spacecraft arrives at the asteroid in 2029, scientists can't say [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=89.14s)]
*  for certain that this is Psyche's origin story. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=94.2s)]
*  Even though we don't know its origin in Genesis, with complete certainty, the value of a mission [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=97.72s)]
*  like this is unprecedented. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=102.66s)]
*  A recent analysis by NASA indicates that Psyche is likely made of a mixture of rock and metal, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  with metal composing between 30 to 60 percent of its volume. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  But why are scientists spending more than one billion dollars to study metal? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=114.83999999999999s)]
*  The fact that it's possibly the exposed core of one of these protoplanets is significant [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=120.91999999999999s)]
*  because Earth formed from the accretion of many, many protoplanets. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=126.6s)]
*  And so Psyche is one small microcosm of a building block of what came to make Earth [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=131.68s)]
*  Earth. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  Earth's outer core lies at a depth of over 1800 miles. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=138.20000000000002s)]
*  So far, scientists have only drilled down about seven and a half of those miles, because [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=142.8s)]
*  that's as far as our current technology can take us. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=147.52s)]
*  And because we can't travel back in time to the earliest days of our solar system and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=150.68s)]
*  we can't right now delve into the center of our own planet, Psyche provides this excellent [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=154.38s)]
*  proxy for trying to better understand the evolution of our planetary neighborhood. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=160.04s)]
*  To study the asteroid's composition, the Psyche spacecraft made by Maxar Technologies [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory will carry a payload of scientific instruments. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  The instruments will determine if Psyche has a magnetic field, study its chemical and mineral [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=175.85999999999999s)]
*  composition and map out its topography. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=180.68s)]
*  Psyche is currently the only known place in our solar system where scientists can examine [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=184.48s)]
*  directly what may contain metal from the core of a planetismal. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=188.56s)]
*  NASA seems to be in what some scientists call the golden age of asteroids. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=192.48s)]
*  Asteroids and small bodies like comets were ignored for a long time in lieu of going to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=198.04s)]
*  the moon and trying to figure out how to get to Mars. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=203.32s)]
*  And now I think NASA is really putting its money where its mouth is in terms of exploring [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=206.68s)]
*  these types of worlds. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=211.24s)]
*  And while the most recent asteroid-related mission brought back samples from a different [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=213.2s)]
*  asteroid and Psyche isn't bringing back samples, the rarity of this metallic world and what [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=218.16s)]
*  we could learn from it really is what gives this mission value. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCs0lRtB6E&t=224.6s)]
