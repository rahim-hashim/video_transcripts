# What the Inflation of the 1970s Can Teach Us Today | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 25, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440)
*  Everyone is talking about inflation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=0.0s)]
*  Inflation. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=2.0s)]
*  Inflation. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Inflation. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=3.52s)]
*  It's the word that's been on everyone's lips lately, and some are looking back at history. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=4.32s)]
*  In fact, we've not heard inflation talked this much since really the 1970s. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  That's because over the past few months, prices for everything from gasoline to groceries have [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=15.68s)]
*  been rising sharply as the economy roars back from the pandemic recession. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  This graph charts the Consumer Price Index, a metric that measures the average change in [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=25.36s)]
*  prices for consumer goods and services compared to a year ago. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=30.88s)]
*  Or more simply put, inflation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=34.96s)]
*  In May of this year, prices spiked 5% to reach the highest annual inflation rate in nearly 13 years. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=37.44s)]
*  Many economists believe that a small amount of inflation, around 2%, is inevitable and even [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=45.36s)]
*  desirable. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=51.04s)]
*  That's essentially what we've had for the past 15 years before this most recent surge. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=52.08s)]
*  But these recent increases have some fearing that the U.S. might be returning to the runaway [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=57.92s)]
*  inflation of the 1970s. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=62.72s)]
*  No one wants to see that happen again. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=64.88s)]
*  So are we returning to the spiraling inflation of the late 1960s and 1970s? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  Or is today's inflation, as the Fed assures us, transitory? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=74.8s)]
*  This is an extraordinarily unusual time. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=78.88s)]
*  For those old enough to remember it, the Great Inflation was a period in which the cost of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=84.08s)]
*  living for millions of Americans soared. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=88.88s)]
*  From 1965 to 1982, prices for food and everyday consumer items rose dramatically from 2% in 1962 [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  to 15% in 1979. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=100.24s)]
*  During that same period, unemployment also rose steadily, eventually reaching [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  just above 10%. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=108.32s)]
*  The term stagflation, an economic condition of both rising inflation and increasing unemployment, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=110.08s)]
*  became the go-to phrase to describe the period's economic malaise. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=116.0s)]
*  This was a time when consumers protested rising meat prices, union members picketed for cost of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=121.28s)]
*  living pay increases, and long lines for unemployment and gas became commonplace. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  Here in New Jersey, 10% of the workforce is unemployed. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=132.64s)]
*  Across the nation, the average is 8%. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=136.72s)]
*  The main lesson from the 70s is that kind of nagging, persistent, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=139.27999999999997s)]
*  recurrent double-digit inflation doesn't happen overnight. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  It sets in over many years, and it's set in because of a long series of policy mistakes [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  in Washington. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=157.6s)]
*  The Great Inflation has its roots in the government spending of the 1960s. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  Consumer prices began rising under President Johnson as he escalated the Vietnam War and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  launched his Great Society social programs. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=170.4s)]
*  But the double-digit inflation the period is famous for didn't begin until President [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=173.28s)]
*  Richard Nixon took office. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=177.92s)]
*  The time has come for a new economic policy for the United States. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=180.16s)]
*  In 1971, Nixon ordered that the dollar would no longer be backed by gold. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=184.56s)]
*  Inflation robs every American, every one of you. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=190.4s)]
*  Nixon also influenced the Fed's monetary policy, pushing the central bank to pump more [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=193.84s)]
*  money into the economy and keep interest rates low. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  By letting inflation rise gradually for a number of years, the Fed compromised the trust, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=202.56s)]
*  the public held that the Fed would maintain price stability. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  Businesses and households started expecting that inflation would persist. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=217.28000000000003s)]
*  As prices went up, workers started pressing in part for unions. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=222.4s)]
*  As wages went up, companies started raising prices even more. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=227.28s)]
*  And we got this game of leapfrog where prices and wages both went up. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=232.16s)]
*  We must whip inflation right now. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=236.56s)]
*  These policy missteps continued under President Ford. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=240.32s)]
*  And later under President Carter, the issue was exacerbated further by OPEC's oil embargoes. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  Our most serious domestic problem, that problem is inflation. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=249.84s)]
*  It wouldn't be until President Jimmy Carter appointed Paul Volcker as the chairman of the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=254.88s)]
*  Federal Reserve that the great inflation finally began to disappear. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  Paul Volcker, the Fed chairman, said, I'm going to stop this cycle. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=265.12s)]
*  And he clamped down on the growth of money supply and jacked up interest rates. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=270.4s)]
*  It caused two very severe recessions. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=275.2s)]
*  But that, it turned out, to be really what needed to happen to get inflation under control. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  Volcker's inflation crackdown represented a new chapter for America's monetary policy. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=284.64s)]
*  The 1960s and 1970s, the Fed did not have an articulated inflation targeting strategy, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=289.68s)]
*  that inflation should be around 2%. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=296.0s)]
*  And so they were not focused on keeping inflation under control. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=298.48s)]
*  In the 1970s, the Fed was not even willing to commit to what they meant by price stability. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=303.92s)]
*  It was kind of, trust us, trust us, we will deliver, which is horrible policy. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=311.84s)]
*  Today, we can see some clear similarities between our modern inflationary period [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=318.32s)]
*  and that of the 1970s. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=322.56s)]
*  Just like the 70s, prices are rising. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=324.56s)]
*  The Federal Reserve has increased the money supply and government spending is up. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=326.72s)]
*  But comparing today's inflation with that of the entire great inflation, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=331.76s)]
*  especially the 1970s, is not accurate. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=335.76s)]
*  I graduated from college in 1975. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=338.56s)]
*  I had a front row seat. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=340.56s)]
*  Nothing like that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=342.64s)]
*  I don't expect anything like that to happen. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=344.0s)]
*  Today's inflation and the threat that we have is actually like the last half of the 1960s. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=346.0s)]
*  It's not like the 1970s. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  In the mid 1960s, inflation had been running about 2%. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=356.8s)]
*  By the end of the 1960s, inflation went to about 5%. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=361.68s)]
*  The last inflation reading we had was still below 5%. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=367.04s)]
*  And so you're nowhere near 20%, which was the highest inflation reading at the end of the 1970s. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=370.48s)]
*  There's almost no period in the 1970s that had inflation as low as we have now. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=376.32000000000005s)]
*  Some of the recent spikes in inflation are a very healthy sign of the recovery. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=382.08s)]
*  What we experienced last year wasn't normal. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=389.04s)]
*  Take airfares in the airline industry. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=392.08s)]
*  We have this dramatic drop of airfares that was a sign [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=395.2s)]
*  of the risk that the whole industry would collapse. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  It's a healthy sign that we see a reversal of those increases today. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  For their part, the Fed says it remains committed to its long-held stance [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=408.0s)]
*  that today's inflation is temporary. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=412.72s)]
*  The Fed believes that we're having a supply shock. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=415.04s)]
*  And so that's causing shortages in temporary places. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=418.08s)]
*  That's the Fed's theory. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=421.2s)]
*  What we're seeing now, we believe, is inflation in particular categories of goods and services [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=422.56s)]
*  that are being directly affected by this unique historical event that none of us has [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=428.96s)]
*  lived through before called reopening the economy after closing it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=433.44s)]
*  Every time we have an economic recovery from a recession, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=437.52000000000004s)]
*  we expect to see inflation rise above 2% for a while. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=441.76000000000005s)]
*  That's normal. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=446.32s)]
*  If it turns out that these impacts are more than transitory, if they're lasting, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  they persist or even increase, then the Fed might have to do something to stop it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  On June 16, Federal Reserve officials signaled that they expect to raise interest rates [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=458.96000000000004s)]
*  by late 2023, sooner than they anticipated in March. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am17uljm440&t=464.72s)]
