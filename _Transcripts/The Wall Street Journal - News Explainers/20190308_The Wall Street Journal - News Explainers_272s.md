# California Home Prices Are Soaring. Here's Why | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 08, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g)
*  Dreaming of that California lifestyle? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, you better be saving. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=3.2s)]
*  The reason our poverty rate is high, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=5.16s)]
*  or the highest in the country, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=7.92s)]
*  is the cost of housing. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=9.36s)]
*  The number of people in California who can afford to buy a home [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=10.72s)]
*  continues to fall. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=13.76s)]
*  The median home price in California is $519,000, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=15.44s)]
*  while the national median is $275,000. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=20.36s)]
*  Between January 2012 and 2019, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=24.88s)]
*  the average list price for home buyers rose about 85%. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=28.72s)]
*  The median home price in the United States [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=33.16s)]
*  only rose about 53% in the same timeframe. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=35.28s)]
*  Today, a mere 54% of Californians are homeowners. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=39.12s)]
*  Only New York State had a lower rate. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=43.2s)]
*  So what's going on here? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  California has been a hotspot in the country's growing job market. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=48.8s)]
*  Between 2010 and 2018, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  more than 29,000 jobs were added each month. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=54.96s)]
*  That adds up to around 3 million jobs in less than a decade. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=58.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, the pace of new housing construction hasn't kept up. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=61.76s)]
*  Between 2010 and 2017, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=65.4s)]
*  California issued about 635,000 new housing permits, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  and that's well under the state's projected housing needs. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=71.76s)]
*  This contrast is particularly stark in the Bay Area, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=75.12s)]
*  where the average home value in certain counties has surpassed $1 million. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=78.2s)]
*  All these high-income workers now who want to own homes, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=82.6s)]
*  but there's just simply not enough housing out there for them to buy. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=86.92s)]
*  And so unfortunately, what you've seen happen is that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=90.56s)]
*  that housing has ended up going to the highest bidder. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=92.84s)]
*  So why were so few homes being built in California? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=95.68s)]
*  For starters, it's not cheap to build there. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=99.72s)]
*  Homes in California's coastal metros are three times more expensive to build [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=102.56s)]
*  than in the rest of the country. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  The cost of labor, land, material and government fees [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=108.28s)]
*  are all very high in California. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=111.76s)]
*  California also has more comprehensive building standards, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=113.8s)]
*  which can add to costs and bog down the pace of new construction. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=116.8s)]
*  According to a 2015 government report on housing costs, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  the state requires builders to use high-quality building materials, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=124.44s)]
*  such as windows, insulation and heating and cooling systems, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=128.24s)]
*  to achieve certain energy efficiency goals. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=131.68s)]
*  Another factor limiting housing supply, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=135.64s)]
*  local control over zoning. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=138.04s)]
*  A lot of people care about local control of land. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=140.32s)]
*  The reality is local control of land is, in a sense, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=143.04s)]
*  the cornerstone of all land use regulation. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=145.52s)]
*  These rules allow residents to snub out new development [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=149.8s)]
*  that might change their neighborhoods. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  That power can be used to cancel plans for things like new apartment buildings. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=155.0s)]
*  Apartments can house more people in a given amount of space, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=159.52s)]
*  which in turn can increase strain on local roads or schools. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=163.16000000000003s)]
*  So some homeowners in California oppose their development. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=167.36s)]
*  This opposition to increased population density [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=171.4s)]
*  can limit new housing supply for middle and lower-income Californians [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=174.16s)]
*  and drive up prices for existing homes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=177.76s)]
*  There is also a debate around a law that passed decades before the latest housing boom. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=181.2s)]
*  We have proven here in California that we the people, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=185.8s)]
*  not the politicians, are still the boss. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=191.6s)]
*  In the late 1970s, California limited large increases in property tax to 2% annually [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=197.0s)]
*  unless the property is sold or renovated. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=203.12s)]
*  Critics say this tax law can influence local governments [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=205.24s)]
*  who determine how available land is used. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  They argue officials give preference to businesses over housing developments [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  because companies can generate tax revenues beyond property tax, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  which could mean that this local tax law limits supply. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  The global market is also playing a role in California's housing woes. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  Chinese buyers are currently leading foreign investments in United States real estate. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=227.96s)]
*  And nearly 40% of the Chinese buying American real estate [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=232.56s)]
*  make their purchase in California. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=236.12s)]
*  Their bids were often placed at the higher end of the market, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=238.8s)]
*  which contributed to accelerating market rates. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=241.52s)]
*  These foreign investments spiked in the latter part of 2015, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=244.56s)]
*  but have since declined. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=248.0s)]
*  While the state analyzes its options, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=250.32s)]
*  California sheds residents at ever-increasing rates. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=252.4s)]
*  Net migration has been negative for the last decade in the state. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=255.68s)]
*  And a big reason why is that California, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=259.20000000000005s)]
*  with its weather and opportunities, is just too expensive. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYaNEwd34g&t=261.32000000000005s)]
