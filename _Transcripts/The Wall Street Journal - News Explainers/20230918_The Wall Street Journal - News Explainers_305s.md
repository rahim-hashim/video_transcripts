Video Description: South Korea is the fastest-growing arms exporter in the world, with their defense exports growing by 177% in just a five-year period. Although the U.S., Russia and France have larger defense industries, analysts say the pace at which Seoul is expanding marks a shift for their future.

South Korea’s largest defense company, Hanwha, is quickly constructing K-9 Howitzers for Poland and new submarines called KSS-iii  that could help bolster NATO’s arsenal in the future.

WSJ takes a rare look inside Hanwha’s facilities to see how South Korea is transforming into a defense giant and explores what this means for the Western military alliance.

# How South Korea is Transforming Into a Weapons Export Giant  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc)
*  Here, South Korea's largest defence company is testing a new batch of weapons. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=0.0s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal got a rare look inside Hanwha's facilities as it constructs how [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=6.48s)]
*  it's destined for Poland and submarines that could bolster NATO's arsenal in the future. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=10.52s)]
*  That says South Korea is increasing its arms sales at a rate faster than anywhere else [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=17.02s)]
*  in the world. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  In just a five year period it has grown its defence exports by 177%. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=23.0s)]
*  Although the US, Russia and France have considerably larger defence industries, analysts say the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=29.12s)]
*  pace at which South Korea is expanding its output marks a substantial shift for the future. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=34.04s)]
*  So here's how the country is transforming into a defence giant and what it means for [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=40.24s)]
*  the Western Military Alliance. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  Workers inside this Hanwha plant are building dozens of self-propelled canine howitzers. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=48.88s)]
*  Hanwha is South Korea's largest defence company. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=53.84s)]
*  They are playing a big role in South Korea's arms exports. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=56.52s)]
*  That's largely due to Poland, a key NATO member, purchasing them as part of a $13.7 [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  billion arms deal. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=66.76s)]
*  Military analysts say the rapid speed the workers here can build them is a major selling [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=69.16s)]
*  point. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=73.0s)]
*  The process is completed in three stages, assembling the skeleton of the weapon, connecting [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=74.0s)]
*  the parts and then testing its performance. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=79.2s)]
*  Although the company won't disclose specific production times, recent deliveries have been [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  prompt. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=86.44s)]
*  The first shipment of canines arrived in Poland in December, just over three months after [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=88.12s)]
*  the deal was signed. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=92.88s)]
*  That's in contrast to other arms deals in Europe that are still ongoing years after [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=95.08s)]
*  the agreements were made. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=99.36s)]
*  Hanwha says a quick completion time is a major part of its strategy to entice new customers. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=102.32s)]
*  Military analysts say South Korea is able to build these systems faster than some Western [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=110.96s)]
*  counterparts, in part because of decades of escalating regional tensions. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=114.72s)]
*  At the end of the Cold War, military powers in Europe began reducing their capacity to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=120.48s)]
*  produce conventional weapons, while the threat from North Korea led Seoul to ramp up its [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=124.56s)]
*  production. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=129.4s)]
*  In the years since then, South Korea has mostly focused on developing traditional battlefield [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=131.7s)]
*  weapons. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=136.16s)]
*  So while countries like the US have focused on creating high-end weapons such as aircraft [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=137.24s)]
*  and nuclear submarines, South Korea has focused on other weapons such as artillery. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=143.96s)]
*  But now it's looking to export more advanced naval designs to the West. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=149.76s)]
*  At this Hanwha shipyard, workers are building vessels including the KSS-3, the company's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=154.76s)]
*  newest submarine. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=159.8s)]
*  Industry analysts say it's one of the most affordable pieces of its caliber in the world. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=161.84s)]
*  Hanwha is negotiating to sell the diesel-powered craft to Canada, another NATO member. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=166.0s)]
*  The company is trying to keep costs and production time down by using automated machines and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=171.12s)]
*  producing more components locally. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=175.8s)]
*  The company plans to double its production capacity for these systems by 2027. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=188.28s)]
*  Military analysts say the designs could help bolster NATO in the future, as China's navy, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  which is the world's largest, continues to expand. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=198.28s)]
*  Traditionally, NATO countries buy weapons from other member states. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=202.08s)]
*  But South Korea, an ally of the alliance, has been fulfilling a niche for weapons that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=207.36s)]
*  are in demand due to the war in Ukraine. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=211.44s)]
*  The US, for example, has also struggled with supply shortages, especially as it continues [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=215.88s)]
*  to send lethal aid to Ukraine. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=221.32s)]
*  Industry analysts say supply chain problems haven't been an issue for South Korea, partly [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=224.68s)]
*  because it's not sending lethal weapons to Kiev. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  For South Korea's government, expanding its defense exports is a key policy objective. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=254.68s)]
*  President Yun Suk-yul is relying on companies like Hanwha to reach the goal of becoming [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  the fourth largest arms exporter by 2027. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  The rapid growth is not unsustainable, according to some military analysts who point to the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=273.04s)]
*  country's long tradition of manufactured exports. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=277.64s)]
*  That includes everything from cars, phones and semiconductors to container ships. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=281.56s)]
*  However, as orders of these weapons stack up, defense analysts say Seoul may be over-promising [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=286.4s)]
*  how fast it can complete them. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=292.24s)]
*  Being able to keep delivering them on time will be key for its success. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J9vcvRJvlc&t=294.76s)]
