Video Description: Former president Donald Trump’s and Vice President Kamala Harris’s tax policies are on completely different tracks. Trump has proposed about $6.5 trillion in tax cuts and would impose major tariffs on imported goods. Harris has proposed $4.2 trillion in cuts and would cut taxes for households under $400,000 and would raise taxes on corporations and the rich. 

WSJ’s Richard Rubin breaks down the very different tax plans from the two candidates.

# The $2.3T Gap Between Trump’s and Harris’s Tax Plans  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [September 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k)
*  Donald Trump's and Kamala Harris's tax policies are on completely different tracks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=0.0s)]
*  I will pass gigantic tax cuts for workers and keep their jobs here in the United States. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=5.44s)]
*  Billionaires and big corporations must pay their fair share in taxes. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=11.32s)]
*  Trump has a whole range of tax cuts that he's looking to implement, and he's proposing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=16.76s)]
*  to raise tariffs significantly, which could help cover some of those costs. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=22.92s)]
*  Harris, on the other hand, has a bunch of tax cuts and then is proposing trillions of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=28.76s)]
*  dollars of tax increases mostly on corporations and high-income households. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=33.2s)]
*  But they're running in different directions, reshaping who pays taxes in America. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=37.88s)]
*  On one track, Trump has proposed roughly $2 trillion more in tax cuts than Harris, and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=43.28s)]
*  would impose major tariffs on imported goods, which could help pay for those cuts. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=48.84s)]
*  On the opposite track, Harris would cut taxes for households that make under $400,000, and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=53.52s)]
*  would raise taxes on corporations and the rich. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  This is how Trump's plan could work. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=62.6s)]
*  Trump is borrowing much of his tax policy plans from his previous stint in the White House. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=65.4s)]
*  He wants to extend the tax cuts he signed into law in 2017. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=70.56s)]
*  The tax bill from 2017 made a number of changes, including lower tax rates, an increased standard [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=75.36s)]
*  and doubling the child tax credit. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=83.4s)]
*  But those changes for households are set to expire at the end of 2025. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  The tax cuts Trump has proposed on the 2024 campaign trail could come at a heavy cost, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=91.2s)]
*  more than $6.5 trillion over 10 years. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  Extending the tax cuts past 2025 could end up costing the federal government more than [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  $4 trillion over a decade. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=105.2s)]
*  Trump recently proposed a lower corporate tax rate of 15% that would only apply to companies [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=108.96s)]
*  that make products in the U.S., estimated to reduce federal revenue by $200 billion [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=114.08s)]
*  over the next decade. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  A reduction in the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15% solely for companies that make [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=121.64s)]
*  their product in America. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=129.92s)]
*  Trump has suggested eliminating the income tax on Social Security benefits. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=132.24s)]
*  In 2022, almost half of Social Security recipients paid those taxes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=136.52s)]
*  There will be no tax on Social Security. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=141.96s)]
*  We're going to stop it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=146.4s)]
*  No tax on Social Security. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=147.88s)]
*  Ending income taxes on Social Security benefits could cost the federal government as much [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=151.44s)]
*  as $1.8 trillion in revenue over a decade. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=155.4s)]
*  By one estimate, ending those taxes would cause the Social Security fund to become insolvent [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=159.68s)]
*  one year earlier than previously forecast. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=164.84s)]
*  This is a proposal that's really targeted to largely retirees and people, not very, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=167.36s)]
*  very, very wealthy retirees, but people who are kind of well off enough to have some other [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=173.24s)]
*  source of income just beside Social Security. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=178.0s)]
*  Harris is running in a different direction, cutting taxes on middle-income families, lower-income [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=181.72s)]
*  families and raising taxes pretty sharply on high-income households and on corporations. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=186.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris has largely adopted President Joe Biden's plan, which has fewer cuts compared [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=193.0s)]
*  to Trump's, costing about $4 trillion over 10 years. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=197.39999999999998s)]
*  The biggest chunk, extending tax cuts for households making under $400,000 a year, at [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=202.16s)]
*  an estimated cost of about $2.8 trillion. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=207.76s)]
*  One point of departure, Harris would go further to increase the child tax credit for young [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  children. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=216.72s)]
*  I'll not only restore that tax cut, but expand it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=217.72s)]
*  We will provide $6,000 in tax relief to families during the first year of a child's life. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=221.16s)]
*  As opposed to $3,600 under the Biden proposal and $2,000 under current law, in some ways [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=227.2s)]
*  you can think of it as covering some potential lost wages for people who might have to take [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  time off to care for a newborn. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=236.2s)]
*  Harris also proposes an expanded credit of $3,600 for children under 6 and $3,000 for [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=238.72s)]
*  older children. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  Altogether, her child tax credit plan would cost $1.2 trillion over the next decade. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=246.48s)]
*  Harris also announced a substantial first-time homebuyer tax credit as part of a larger plan [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=252.92s)]
*  to address housing affordability. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=257.84s)]
*  While we work on the housing shortage, my administration will provide first-time home [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=260.28s)]
*  buyers with $25,000 to help with the down payment on a new home. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=266.28s)]
*  It's a $25,000 in down payment assistance as opposed to $10,000 first-time homebuyer [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=275.52s)]
*  credit that President Biden talked about. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=280.44s)]
*  And that's roughly $100 billion, according to some estimates. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=282.64s)]
*  To raise revenue, Trump's plan focuses on taxing imported goods, particularly from China. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  We're going to have 10 to 20 percent tariffs on foreign countries that have been ripping [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=292.64s)]
*  us off for years. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump loves tariffs. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=299.08s)]
*  Tariffs basically are taxes on imported goods. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=300.08s)]
*  The concern would be that middle-income households use a greater share of their income to purchase [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=303.4s)]
*  imported goods than very high-income households do. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  Trump has also said he wants to repeal the clean energy credits in the Inflation Reduction [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=312.35999999999996s)]
*  Act passed by Democrats in 2022. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=317.09999999999997s)]
*  We're going to terminate this green news scam. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=320.2s)]
*  It's going to be terminated and we're going to end this war on American energy. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=322.76s)]
*  I think Republicans generally are opposed to the electric vehicle tax credit. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=326.52s)]
*  We're going to eliminate the generosity of electric vehicle tax credits. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=331.64s)]
*  If Trump imposes a 10 percent across-the-board tariff and a 60 percent tariff on Chinese goods... [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=334.2s)]
*  There's some estimates out there that suggest that over a decade it could get to three-ish [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=339.76s)]
*  trillion. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  I think there's some squishiness in trying to figure out how much money could actually come in there. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  Economists estimate Trump's tariffs would also raise the price of goods, costing $1,700 [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=352.24s)]
*  a year for the typical household. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=358.12s)]
*  Harris' plan, on the other hand, veers away from tariffs and instead raises taxes on the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=360.76s)]
*  top 3 percent of American households. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=365.84s)]
*  Harris' tax plan, in line with Biden's most recent budget proposal, would raise nearly [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=368.48s)]
*  $5 trillion in revenue. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=373.08s)]
*  A big part of that plan is bringing the corporate rate up to 28 percent. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=375.2s)]
*  The Biden administration, which she's adopted their plans, has basically said we don't [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=379.71999999999997s)]
*  want to extend any of those expiring tax cuts unless we pay for them. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  Harris' plan to raise taxes on households making over $400,000 would bring in about [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=389.28s)]
*  $1.8 trillion in revenue. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=394.8s)]
*  About a third would come from a new minimum income tax on people whose net worth is over [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  $100 million. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=402.52s)]
*  The biggest one and one that's most difficult to get through Congress is this idea of a [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=404.64s)]
*  minimum tax of at least 25 percent on the very top people, people who have at least [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=408.58s)]
*  $100 million in net worth. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=414.64s)]
*  And that basically taxes people based on their unrealized capital gains, their appreciated [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=416.08s)]
*  assets, even with a full Democratic control of Congress that's going to be difficult to sell. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=421.52s)]
*  Whoever wins the White House would also need their party to win the House and the Senate [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=428.56s)]
*  to keep their agendas on track. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  If you have Trump with a Republican House and a Republican Senate, then there's going [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=435.4s)]
*  to be tax cuts. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=439.84s)]
*  Facing the prospect of a divided government, where one party doesn't control the White [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=441.0s)]
*  House and Congress, could cause either tax plan to go off the rails. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=444.9s)]
*  If everything expires at the end of 2025, there would be pretty sizable tax increases. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=450.36s)]
*  For most households, about 60 percent of Americans would see tax increases. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=455.44s)]
*  It's something that people will be talking about a lot if we even get close to December [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=459.76s)]
*  31, 2025, without a deal. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPlhS22BG9k&t=465.88s)]
