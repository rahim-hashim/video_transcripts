# Fake Covid-19 Vaccines What to Know About Counterfeit Shots Sold Online  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 18, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8)
*  As COVID-19 vaccines start being distributed around the world, scams for the products are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=0.0s)]
*  proliferating, from phishing emails to ads on the darknet. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=6.24s)]
*  Some of these offer phony Pfizer or Moderna vaccines that can cost as much as $1,500. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=10.94s)]
*  Once there is a big demand on something, there's starting to be a black market. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=16.52s)]
*  Officials and researchers around the world are worried about the implications for public [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=21.04s)]
*  health and people's personal information. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=24.38s)]
*  For instance, in December, the Department of Homeland Security said it had taken down [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=27.2s)]
*  a fake Moderna website, which appeared to have been used for fraud and spreading malware. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=31.16s)]
*  As it gets to be more broadly applicable, we feel the concerns for counterfeit and fake [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=35.8s)]
*  vaccines will be even more pronounced. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=42.72s)]
*  While Pfizer didn't respond to a request for comment, Moderna said its only sales have [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=45.68s)]
*  been to governments, which are working closely with medical providers to control and secure [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=50.04s)]
*  the first batches of the COVID-19 vaccine. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=54.28s)]
*  So a legitimate vaccine is unlikely to be sold online by dubious sources. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=57.6s)]
*  So far, U.S. authorities say that there have been no reports of fake vaccines being delivered [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=62.56s)]
*  to customers. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=67.28s)]
*  So how do counterfeit COVID-19 vaccines end up online, and what are the risks for people [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=68.84s)]
*  who buy them? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=73.26s)]
*  U.S. health officials say there may be enough vaccines for the general public this spring [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=74.8s)]
*  And in the future, clinics and insurers in various parts of the world can make vaccines [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=81.24s)]
*  available for purchase. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=84.94s)]
*  But for some people, this may seem too far away. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=86.28s)]
*  There is effort from governments to achieve vaccine for their people, but there is limited [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=89.64s)]
*  number of vaccine in general. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  Oded Vanunu is a security researcher based in Israel, and companies hire him to look [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  for and fix breaches in their networks. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  Recently, he's been tracking the sale of COVID-19 vaccines on the darknet, a term used [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=106.84s)]
*  to refer to hidden parts of the internet, which require an encrypted browser such as [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  Tor to access. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=115.92s)]
*  All sorts of illicit goods from drugs to weapons can be traded on these digital black markets. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  Pharmaceuticals on the darknet eventually surface on illicit platforms that look like [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=123.72s)]
*  legitimate e-commerce or government websites. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=127.28s)]
*  Vanunu's team has found more than 1,700 new vaccine-related websites that have cropped [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=130.12s)]
*  up since November. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=135.32s)]
*  Consumers can end up on these through links sent in emails or messaging apps. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=137.32s)]
*  You think that you buy from a legitimate place, but you will get the merchandise from the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  darknet. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  Vanunu says the best way to spot a counterfeit is to have information about the real vaccine. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  For instance, some darknet vendors Vanunu spoke to incorrectly stated that the Pfizer [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=153.48s)]
*  vaccine doesn't need to be stored in super freezers at minus 70 degrees Celsius and shipped [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  in dry ice. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=163.38s)]
*  One of the vendors told us you don't need a minus 70 degree, you need minus 10 and you [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  can put it on the freezer. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=171.29999999999998s)]
*  Vanunu said he reached out to one vendor who was selling a vaccine developed in China, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=173.38s)]
*  but had no brand. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  A batch of 14 doses could be delivered within two weeks and was priced at 0.01 Bitcoin, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=178.85999999999999s)]
*  the equivalent of about $250 in December. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=185.62s)]
*  He purchased $700 worth of this product for research purposes, but two weeks later it [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=189.14s)]
*  had not arrived. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=193.9s)]
*  But if a fake vaccine that was ordered online actually arrives, there are risks for the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=198.9s)]
*  buyer. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=203.06s)]
*  Mansur Amici is a pharmacist who works with vaccine developers and international agencies [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=215.70000000000002s)]
*  to track the global trade of illicit drugs and medical products. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=220.78s)]
*  In Europe, for example, between March and September, authorities seized more than 33 [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=224.54s)]
*  million fake medical devices and eight tons of illicit pharmaceuticals. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=228.94s)]
*  European authorities warned fake vaccine sellers could do the same. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  They may mix water or they may create some colored liquid to mirror what looks like a [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=237.86s)]
*  vaccine and then put a label on top that looks very similar to the Moderna or Pfizer label. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=243.02s)]
*  One of the biggest risks of being inoculated with fake vaccines is that these substances [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=250.66s)]
*  could be toxic and cause side effects, eventually undermining people's trust in the real COVID-19 [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=255.02s)]
*  vaccine, at a time when many around the world are already skeptical. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=260.9s)]
*  For instance, a survey shows that the percentage of people who strongly or somewhat agreed [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=266.54s)]
*  they would get the vaccine decreased in December. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=270.82s)]
*  Anyone who gets inoculated with a fake vaccine may also have a false sense of security that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=274.58s)]
*  may leave them vulnerable to infection while also raising the risk of transmission to others. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=279.12s)]
*  So for vaccination campaigns to be effective in fighting the virus, a vast majority of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=284.96s)]
*  the population will need to get safe vaccines. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkTmgfYWe8&t=289.36s)]
