# Why Conglomerates Split Up | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 18, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU)
*  In November, Johnson & Johnson and General Electric both announced that they are splitting up. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=0.0s)]
*  Johnson & Johnson will break into two separate public companies, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=5.64s)]
*  one focused on consumer health products and the other on pharmaceuticals. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=9.44s)]
*  And GE will split into three companies, centered on health care, power and aviation. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=13.64s)]
*  The splintering of these two heavyweights is just the latest in a number of big corporate breakups, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=19.56s)]
*  even as tech companies continue to consolidate. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=25.04s)]
*  A lot of people are saying that this may be the end or the death of the corporate conglomerate as we've known it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=27.96s)]
*  Here's what led to the latest wave of breakups, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=35.56s)]
*  and what they could mean for legions of shareholders with a stake in these industry titans. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=38.24s)]
*  The breakup of conglomerates isn't a new phenomenon. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=44.8s)]
*  The rationale for industrial conglomerates in the first place was efficiency. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Jason Zweig has been covering investing and financial history for The Wall Street Journal for over a decade. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=53.36s)]
*  He says the conglomerate model tended to work for a while, until the market got overheated. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=59.08s)]
*  It stopped working and people learned that these businesses rise and fall together. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=64.44s)]
*  One of the things that happened in the 1980s is that we had the rise of the leverage buyout movement, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=71.32s)]
*  which today we would call private equity. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=77.8s)]
*  And so large funds were able to get access to relatively cheap money, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=80.76s)]
*  which they could use to buy undervalued assets. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=86.84s)]
*  So a lot of conglomerates chose that particular time to split up. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  Conglomerates continued to decline in popularity in the 1990s and 2000s. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  And then in 2008, this happened. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  The Dow tumbled more than 500 points after two pillars of the street tumbled over the weekend. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  The 2008 financial crisis marked a new shift for some of the remaining industrial conglomerates. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=108.6s)]
*  Investors led a push to break up bigger companies when the individual units [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=114.19999999999999s)]
*  seemed to be underperforming independent rivals. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=118.44s)]
*  For example, Siemens, the German multinational technology giant, saw its stock plunge more than 60 percent. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=121.24s)]
*  Under pressure from investors, it shed its health care and energy businesses, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=128.28s)]
*  shifting from a conglomerate into a company focused on higher margin software and technology. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=132.76s)]
*  This strategy worked. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=138.44s)]
*  Since then, Siemens market capitalization has surpassed its rival GE. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=140.12s)]
*  For years, GE, one of America's oldest industrial giants, had been struggling. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=145.0s)]
*  The company was engaging in some aggressive accounting in the late 90s and into the beginning of the 2000s. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, that led to problems down the road. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=159.64s)]
*  GE Capital, its financial arm, was taking risks that really did not pan out during the financial crisis. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=162.6s)]
*  And like Siemens, GE faced pressure both internally and externally to split, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  after parts of its business continued to perform poorly. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=176.83999999999997s)]
*  Certainly, management was under enormous pressure internally to do something. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=180.11999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, they were under enormous pressure from activist institutional investors. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=185.72s)]
*  In the early 2000s, GE began selling off portions of its business, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=192.44s)]
*  from insurance and appliances to NBCUniversal. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=197.0s)]
*  General Electric is selling NBCUniversal to the cable TV giant Comcast. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=200.28s)]
*  And its majority stake in oil and gas. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=206.04s)]
*  And on November 9th, 2021, the company announced it would break up its last three parts, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=208.92s)]
*  marking the end of an era for the industrial titan. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=214.44000000000003s)]
*  This was just days before Johnson & Johnson, the world's largest health products company by sales, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=217.32000000000002s)]
*  announced plans to break up as well. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=222.52s)]
*  But it had different reasons. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=224.76000000000002s)]
*  Johnson & Johnson's CEO said the company decided to split because the businesses, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=226.60000000000002s)]
*  customers and markets have diverged so much in recent years, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=231.0s)]
*  a pattern that accelerated during the pandemic. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=234.60000000000002s)]
*  I think they just reached the point where, like GE, they felt they could be more efficient and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=237.08s)]
*  each unit could get the full attention it deserved if they split apart. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  Zweig says that when conglomerates split, it's often due to external pressure. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=250.84s)]
*  When things start to go wrong, what people say is, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=255.56s)]
*  you could realize the value that's locked up in these parts of the company. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=259.48s)]
*  So people will go from viewing it as a unified whole [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=265.08000000000004s)]
*  to viewing it as a set of pieces that would do better when they were broken off from the whole. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=269.48s)]
*  And that applies to institutional investors, individual investors, competitors. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=276.68s)]
*  An executive at Johnson & Johnson said it will be in a better position standing alone [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=282.12s)]
*  to make decisions and allocate resources. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=286.92s)]
*  So what do big corporate breakups mean for shareholders? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=290.68s)]
*  Over the long run, split ups do tend to create value for investors in the surviving companies. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=294.36s)]
*  Now, whether it'll be true in these particular cases is very difficult to say. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=304.6s)]
*  For Johnson & Johnson, investors can expect the second company will have a new name [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=310.36s)]
*  and the legacy business will continue to go by J&J. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  For GE, current shareholders are likely to receive shares of the new energy and [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=318.44s)]
*  healthcare companies as dividends when they spin off, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=323.08s)]
*  while the original company that remains will focus on aviation. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=326.03999999999996s)]
*  This may be the end or it might just be the end of the beginning, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=329.96s)]
*  but it's likely that we will see more of these breakups. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=333.88s)]
*  For many non-tech companies, the future is looking smaller and more specialized. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=339.4s)]
*  But what it means for investors is yet to be seen. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YVUUo2PNU&t=344.03999999999996s)]
