# Why Elon Musk Says Twitter Bankruptcy Is a Possibility | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k)
*  When Elon Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion, he inherited a company that had [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=0.84s)]
*  not turned a profit for eight of the past 10 years. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=5.76s)]
*  They were having trouble attracting new users. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  They're having trouble increasing the revenue. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=11.96s)]
*  It's tough to determine the state of Twitter's financial health now that it's a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=15.08s)]
*  private company. But analysts have been able to piece together an assessment [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  from the company's last regulatory filings and Musk's public statements. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=22.16s)]
*  Elon, Elon! [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=26.96s)]
*  S&P data showed that Twitter had less than $600 million in net debt before the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=28.16s)]
*  takeover talks. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=33.2s)]
*  Now post-acquisition, they have $13 billion in debt, and that's a major burden [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=34.4s)]
*  on their shoulders. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=40.36s)]
*  The company last year generated just over $630 million in operating cash flow, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  while this new debt could potentially swell its interest payments to more than [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=47.8s)]
*  $1 billion a year. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=51.32s)]
*  That's a lot of money that they have to pay down with cash. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=53.32s)]
*  And where are they going to find that cash? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=57.0s)]
*  Just one week after taking over the company, Musk said in tweets that Twitter [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=59.24s)]
*  had suffered a massive drop in revenue and was losing over $4 million a day. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  The journal has reported that a number of big advertisers have paused their [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=68.8s)]
*  spending on the platform. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  Nearly 90 percent of Twitter's revenue last year came from advertising. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=74.0s)]
*  Analysts have pointed to this being a significant decline in revenue as a [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=78.08s)]
*  major companies leave over concerns over what's the future of the business [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=82.68s)]
*  model, what's the vision under Musk. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=88.28s)]
*  To make ends meet, Musk has moved quickly to slash costs, including cutting [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=90.68s)]
*  the company's staff by half. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  Filings showed Twitter had 5,500 full-time employees at the end of 2020 [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  and 7,500 a year later. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=101.84s)]
*  Based on the company's most recently disclosed median pay figure, the layoffs [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=104.76s)]
*  of about 3,700 people could save Twitter roughly $860 million a year. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=108.68s)]
*  This represents about 15 percent of Twitter's $5.57 billion in costs and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  expenses last year. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=119.2s)]
*  Analysts have noted that this could do more harm than good because some of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  the company's most critical engineers and developers and marketers are [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  heading out the door. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  The billionaire owner has also been trying to add subscription revenue with [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=132.68s)]
*  the Twitter Blue Service, which gives users a blue verified checkmark if [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=136.16s)]
*  they pay $7.99 a month. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=140.4s)]
*  It's unclear whether there's enough demand for that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  But subscription revenue is potentially a new outlet, a new opportunity to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  make up for the revenue that's been lost amid the recent advertiser [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  accidents. In an all-hands meeting with Twitter staff on November 10th, Musk [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=155.24s)]
*  warned that bankruptcy is a possibility for the company. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=159.6s)]
*  Analysts and academics said even if these financial challenges continue to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=162.72s)]
*  mount, there could be other options. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  He could raise equity. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=168.76000000000002s)]
*  He could buy back debt from lenders, potentially at a very deep discount. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=170.4s)]
*  In the event that the company does go into bankruptcy, this is not Musk's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=175.68s)]
*  preferred option. He put $27 billion of his own money in the business, and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  that likely means that those funds will be entirely wiped out. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=186.0s)]
*  It remains to be seen what direction he'll take. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuhhT1pB9k&t=190.12s)]
