# Top Democrat Explains How Immigration Politics Have Changed  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU)
*  We can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=0.0s)]
*  That phrase, secure our border, appears at least 10 times in the 2024 Democratic Party [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=8.88s)]
*  platform. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=14.96s)]
*  It's a major shift from 2020, where the phrase doesn't appear even once. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=15.96s)]
*  Harris and the Democratic Party have adopted a stricter stance on the border as voters [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=21.48s)]
*  have soured on immigration levels. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=25.92s)]
*  Voters don't like seeing chaos at the southwest border any more than Republicans. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=28.6s)]
*  But at the same time, Republicans' opposition to immigration has reached a high. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=32.52s)]
*  The greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=37.84s)]
*  Here's why both parties, and the electorate, are looking for stricter border policies, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  and what that means for November. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=46.84s)]
*  One reason behind the change in rhetoric is a change in which policies voters say they [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  want. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  Let's look at four popular immigration proposals. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=55.48s)]
*  Before the 2020 election, Democrats favored pathways to citizenship, while Republicans [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  favored more restrictive policies like expanding the wall. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=64.2s)]
*  Both parties viewed hiring more border agents favorably. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=67.92s)]
*  This year, those views have shifted. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=71.36s)]
*  While even more Republicans want to see an expanded wall and more deportation, Democrats [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=73.52s)]
*  are also seeing those proposals slightly more favorably, even as they still want pathways [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=78.64s)]
*  to citizenship. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=84.24s)]
*  A lot of these policies that people indicate they're supportive of are pretty directly [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=85.24s)]
*  contradictory to each other. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  And ultimately, if I had to guess what that means, it just means that people are looking [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  at this issue and saying, it's been so broken for so long. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=96.64s)]
*  I just need my politicians to try something to fix it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=100.72s)]
*  So why the shift over the last four years? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=105.24s)]
*  To start, border crossings have increased nearly fivefold after low numbers at the beginning [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=108.56s)]
*  of the pandemic, many people seeking a form of legal protection called asylum. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=113.92s)]
*  And the backlog of asylum cases has been growing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=118.4s)]
*  I believe the asylum system is broken in my constituents, whether they be right or left, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=121.48s)]
*  believe the asylum system is broken. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=126.16s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy chairs a subcommittee that oversees funding for homeland security. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=128.12s)]
*  The asylum system inside the United States is so overwhelmed that it often takes five [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=133.0s)]
*  to 10 years for those asylum claims to be processed. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=138.12s)]
*  That broken system became an incentive for people who didn't actually have legitimate [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=141.52s)]
*  asylum claims to come to the United States because they essentially knew that they could [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=147.16s)]
*  stay here for years, maybe even a decade before anybody found out that they didn't have a [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=151.56s)]
*  valid claim. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=156.8s)]
*  In 2022, border cities started busing migrants to blue-led sanctuary cities like Denver, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=158.52s)]
*  New York, D.C. and Chicago, which struggled to provide enough housing and other resources. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=164.32000000000002s)]
*  This issue will destroy New York City. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=170.88s)]
*  Once word spreads that, by the way, there's a free bus for you to New York, New York is [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  also going to provide you free shelter for basically as long as you need it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=179.16s)]
*  New York was like, well, I mean, yeah, we have a right to shelter, but we don't have [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=183.92s)]
*  any more shelters. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  And so that's why I think this came to the forefront in those places where it maybe wouldn't [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=187.8s)]
*  have otherwise. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=191.76s)]
*  While some measures enacted by the Biden administration have started to bring crossings down, the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=192.76s)]
*  surge is part of why Murphy says Democrats are prioritizing border security. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=197.28s)]
*  At the center of Harris's proposed policy is reviving a bill that House Republicans voted [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=202.24s)]
*  down earlier this year. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=207.44s)]
*  And so even though Donald Trump tried to sabotage the border security bill, it is my pledge [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=209.4s)]
*  to you that as president of the United States, I will bring it back up and proudly sign it [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=215.0s)]
*  into law. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=220.48s)]
*  It's really central to Democratic messaging because for years, the Democrats under Biden [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=224.04s)]
*  have been being blamed as the source of all the problems on the border. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  And this was the first time where they were able to say, actually, we're the party of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=233.16s)]
*  solutions. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=237.2s)]
*  Murphy was the bill's Democratic negotiator. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=238.2s)]
*  There is much more talk in the Democratic Party of welcoming people to this country, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  but Democrats want to welcome to this country in a legal way. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=246.76s)]
*  The bill included resources to help speed up the asylum process and limit the number [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=251.0s)]
*  of people who could claim it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=255.54s)]
*  And it included traditionally conservative policies like funding to build the wall. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=257.84s)]
*  As somebody who worked very closely on the 2013 bipartisan bill, I couldn't believe [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=262.56s)]
*  how many concessions the Democrats gave to Republicans. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=266.84s)]
*  Alex Conant was formerly the communications director for Senator Marco Rubio. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=270.04s)]
*  Every time the Democrats in 2013 gave us a little bit of border security, we had to give [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=275.16s)]
*  concessions on what to do with undocumented immigrants in the country in terms of giving [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=279.08s)]
*  them some sort of legal status, ultimately a pathway to citizenship. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=282.8s)]
*  There was none of that in the 2024 bill. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=286.44s)]
*  Harris has said she plans on addressing pathways to citizenship in addition to passing the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=288.52s)]
*  border security bill. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  Sort of going moderate on the issue of immigration is a great way for Democrats to signal that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  they are moderate on other issues as well. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=299.64s)]
*  More restrictive policies appeal to a more middle ground section of the electorate and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  are popular with more moderate Democrats. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=306.52s)]
*  For Trump, immigration has been a winning issue. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=309.68s)]
*  His policies lean heavily on increasing deportation and building a wall, stances that have built [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  on his proposals from 2016 and 2020 and that are viewed favorably by his most staunch supporters. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  I think one of the things Donald Trump does on immigration is he approaches it from a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=324.76s)]
*  lot of different angles. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=328.28s)]
*  He talks about immigrants taking American jobs. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=329.44s)]
*  He also talks about it from a criminal perspective. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=331.91999999999996s)]
*  I don't think that's held up in a lot of statistics, but when you look at voters who [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=334.48s)]
*  are concerned about crime and then they see these stories about illegal immigrants causing [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=338.2s)]
*  the crimes, I think Trump's crackdown is something that appeals to them. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=341.64s)]
*  In a most recent debate, Trump mentioned immigration or the border in his responses to questions [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=345.2s)]
*  on the economy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=350.44s)]
*  And they're coming in and they're taking jobs? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=351.8s)]
*  Tariffs. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=354.32s)]
*  Well, bad immigration is the worst thing that can happen to our economy. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=355.32s)]
*  January 6th. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  I ask, what about all the people that are pouring into our country and killing people? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=359.96000000000004s)]
*  And the election integrity. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=364.2s)]
*  And a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they're trying to get them to vote. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=365.8s)]
*  I think Donald Trump has redefined what it means to be a Republican and on no issues [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=369.88s)]
*  that more apparent than on immigration, where the party is far more skeptical of legal immigration, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=373.88s)]
*  far more concerned about illegal immigration now than it's ever been in the past. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  But Trump's rhetoric does risk alienating voters who may be on the fence. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=383.28s)]
*  In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  They're eating the cats. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=392.2s)]
*  When you talk about immigrants eating dogs and cats without any evidence, that's crazy. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=393.68s)]
*  And so I think to the extent that, you know, he can get off track and go too far on even [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=399.32s)]
*  an issue as winnable as immigration, that's a challenge for his campaign because it does [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=405.38s)]
*  turn off the moderate Republicans and independent voters who like his underlying policies but [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=410.02s)]
*  have concerns about his temperament. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=415.8s)]
*  Democrats also risk going too far in trying to appease voters. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=417.96s)]
*  There is a sort of very vocal immigrant rights community on the left. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=421.5s)]
*  But so far, you haven't actually seen many of those immigrant rights folks break with, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=424.9s)]
*  you know, Kamala or the Democrats in a way that some, let's say on the issue of Gaza [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=430.18s)]
*  and the war in Israel have. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=434.78s)]
*  I think that they have sort of recognized this is a really tough issue. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=436.12s)]
*  And when we have two choices, this is the better of the two. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=439.78s)]
*  For Harris especially, these stricter policies could appeal to independents who make up a [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=442.74s)]
*  majority of undecided voters right now. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=448.02s)]
*  It's a delicate balance for Kamala because she can't just be tough on the border, right? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=450.9s)]
*  Polling shows that most Americans actually want to hear a sort of split message that [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=455.38s)]
*  we're going to be tough, but we're also going to be generous to people who deserve our generosity. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Cm0IK5nnU&t=461.41999999999996s)]
