# What Would a Vaccine Passport Look Like?  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 11, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA)
*  With air travel inching back from its collapse during the pandemic, Americans might be able [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=0.0s)]
*  to fly to Europe this summer, that is, if you're vaccinated. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=5.72s)]
*  Exactly how this new era of pandemic travel will work is still up in the air, but there's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  one approach a lot of people are talking about. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=14.52s)]
*  Vaccine passports. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  COVID passports. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Vaccine passports. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=19.88s)]
*  A COVID passport. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=20.88s)]
*  These so-called vaccine passports or digital health pass systems aim to revive the tourism [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=22.44s)]
*  allow people to attend concerts and events and get back to the office. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=28.040000000000003s)]
*  But creating a coordinated health pass system is so fraught with logistical and ethical [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=31.92s)]
*  conflicts that it could take years to pull off. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=35.8s)]
*  Startups, nonprofits, and governments have already rolled out different kinds of digital [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=38.72s)]
*  health passes, from Israel's Green Pass to an app that allows access to holy sites and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=42.38s)]
*  Mecca. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=46.88s)]
*  But so far, there's no single pass that's used all across the world. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=47.88s)]
*  So what would it take for digital health passes to get people back in the air again and out [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=51.84s)]
*  in the world? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=55.82s)]
*  This is really an unprecedented situation in, you know, the modern global economy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=58.82s)]
*  Julie Wernau reports on the impact of COVID-19 on business for The Wall Street Journal. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=67.66s)]
*  Really the goal of these systems is to make people feel safe enough to resume normal everyday [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=72.46000000000001s)]
*  activities. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=81.14s)]
*  Everything from eating inside at a restaurant or going to a concert venue or traveling. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=82.77999999999999s)]
*  The idea is to have an official digital record of your COVID history that when you travel, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=89.78s)]
*  authorities can check and determine how likely it is that you're carrying the virus. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=95.13999999999999s)]
*  The big challenge is making something that's accepted across borders and stays updated [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  with other countries' COVID regulations. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=104.06s)]
*  Several groups, including privacy advocates, businesses, and health care providers, have [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=107.22s)]
*  proposed solutions. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=111.17999999999999s)]
*  One of those stakeholders is Dakota Gruner. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=112.9s)]
*  She is leading a coalition of over 150 partners, including all the major health pass providers, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=115.74s)]
*  to create a set of global standards to underpin digital health passes. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=122.18s)]
*  She says there are a few main features every digital health pass should have. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=126.9s)]
*  The first is something called interoperability, meaning it should work across different institutions [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=131.34s)]
*  and borders. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=136.46s)]
*  A person can be tested or vaccinated wherever it is that they live and get to an airport [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=137.46s)]
*  or get to a border and have that pass be seamlessly recognized and trusted. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=145.74s)]
*  Say you're traveling from New York to London. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=154.22s)]
*  A successful app would tell you the latest guidelines for both cities and integrate your [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=157.14000000000001s)]
*  official COVID health records from each country. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=162.24s)]
*  Plans are trying out different options like CommonPass, Verifly, and IATA TravelPass. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=165.82s)]
*  But most trials are limited to select routes, and passengers aren't required to use the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=170.86s)]
*  pass. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=175.46s)]
*  So it's hard to tell how it would work on a mass scale. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=176.5s)]
*  The reality is that so far, you know, we're not really seeing this in a very mandatory [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=179.94s)]
*  way very many places, because people don't even know how to mandate it and they don't [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=186.26s)]
*  know what counts as proof or evidence that you've been vaccinated. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=191.98s)]
*  Also key to health passes, according to Gruner, are verifiable health records. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=197.54s)]
*  These include things like vaccine certificates, as well as past COVID test results in past [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  cases. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=206.22s)]
*  If you can have both proof of testing or proof of vaccination, that allows people sort of [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=207.62s)]
*  flexibility and sort of how they, if they can't be vaccinated, you know, perhaps they [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=211.22s)]
*  can be tested. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=215.98s)]
*  In a digital health pass system, health records would need to be uploaded to the app and accessible [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=216.98s)]
*  to different authorities, like physicians or border agents for different uses. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=221.06s)]
*  Experts say consumers should be in control of how much health data they share and with [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=225.9s)]
*  whom. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=229.42000000000002s)]
*  For example, you might choose to share more health information with the doctor giving [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=231.22s)]
*  you your second vaccine dose and less data with the airline you're checking in with [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=234.5s)]
*  at the airport. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=238.54s)]
*  We think that this idea of selective disclosure is really important because it would allow [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=240.34s)]
*  me to share just the minimum information necessary. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=244.14000000000001s)]
*  When that information is shared, authorities need to know that they can trust it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=247.66s)]
*  That's where another key factor comes in, verifiable credentials. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=252.06s)]
*  And that is, you know, literally sort of a packet of data that has, it is verified, you [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=255.98s)]
*  know, that you can say this has been signed and sealed and I sort of know that the packet [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=261.9s)]
*  of data has not been tampered with and I know who it was who's attesting to this packet [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=267.6s)]
*  of data. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=273.3s)]
*  In order for digital health passes to be embraced by both government and regular people, they [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  need to address the ongoing debate over data privacy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  In America, privacy and health privacy has always been a huge hot button issue and people [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=281.94s)]
*  are concerned about sharing even that amount of information and want to know that that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=289.2s)]
*  record is safe. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=294.22s)]
*  Some groups have been advocating for centralizing health data since before COVID-19. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  Government resistance to sharing this data has extended to the current pandemic. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=301.3s)]
*  Several states, including Texas, have banned having to show proof of vaccination, including [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=305.38s)]
*  vaccine passports. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=309.86s)]
*  Government should not require any Texan to show proof of vaccination and reveal private [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=312.02000000000004s)]
*  health information just to go about their daily lives. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=319.18s)]
*  Cybersecurity experts in Israel's public health union have raised concerns about sharing [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=322.1s)]
*  sensitive health data. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=326.78000000000003s)]
*  This is a messy ecosystem. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=328.7s)]
*  There are a huge number of potential issuers of a health pass, testing centers, vaccinators, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=330.02s)]
*  states, and also a huge number of potential verifiers. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=336.62s)]
*  The airlines, border control agencies. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=341.53999999999996s)]
*  Workplaces and employers are also considering tracking health records. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=345.97999999999996s)]
*  One Mercer survey found that almost 51% of companies are either currently tracking their [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=349.76s)]
*  employees' vaccination status or are considering it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=354.78s)]
*  While individual states are taking different approaches to regulating vaccine passports, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=358.86s)]
*  Big Tech is laying out some guidelines for COVID-related apps too. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=363.90000000000003s)]
*  Apple has said COVID-19 app developers need to work with recognized government or health [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=368.1s)]
*  authorities before submitting to Apple. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=372.62s)]
*  And Google has a list of additional requirements for COVID-19 apps going into its Play Store. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=375.7s)]
*  Still, because there are so many apps out there right now, the exact privacy policy [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=381.02000000000004s)]
*  could vary slightly from each app. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=385.86s)]
*  What's more, some health officials contend that tech companies are overcomplicating [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=388.42s)]
*  the process. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=392.18s)]
*  And this health information could be stored in a much simpler form, like in a QR code. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=393.82s)]
*  And there are bigger questions about how these apps will be used together. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=398.46000000000004s)]
*  Some apps like the Ayada Travel Pass and Verifly are focused on the travel industry, while [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=403.3s)]
*  others like Israel's Green Pass or New York's Excelsior Pass are being used to grant people [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=408.18s)]
*  access to events or spaces. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=413.5s)]
*  We're really concerned that essentially by asking people to prove that they've been vaccinated [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=416.1s)]
*  in order to do very normal things like go to work or attend a concert, that we're creating [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=421.62s)]
*  a system in which there are two classes of people, the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=429.3s)]
*  Policy is as important as the technology. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=435.54s)]
*  And we need policymakers to define the range of acceptable use cases. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=439.1s)]
*  And specifically define what is not an acceptable use case for a health pass. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=444.42s)]
*  Exactly where that line is, is still being worked out. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=451.22s)]
*  And finding that balance is going to be crucial for international travel, business, and public health. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku23RM3demA&t=455.02000000000004s)]
