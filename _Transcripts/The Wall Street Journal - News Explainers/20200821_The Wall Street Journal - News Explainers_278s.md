# Why the U.S. Dollar Remains Strong  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U)
*  The US dollar. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=0.0s)]
*  The US dollar. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=1.0s)]
*  Who's the dollar? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=2.0s)]
*  Economists have been predicting the decline of the US dollar for years. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=3.0s)]
*  The dollar is about to become dethroned. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Can the US dollar remain the global reserve currency? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=9.76s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=14.48s)]
*  So there's a very, very strong motivation for a lot of countries to move away from the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=15.48s)]
*  dollar. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=19.88s)]
*  Though the dollar's value has been slipping recently, the coronavirus pandemic has proven [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=20.88s)]
*  it's as powerful as it's ever been. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=25.96s)]
*  Nearly 90% of all global foreign exchange trading involves US dollars. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=29.4s)]
*  And more than half of the world's reserve currency holdings are in US dollars. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=34.44s)]
*  No other currency even comes close. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=39.6s)]
*  When the pandemic hit, there was a rush for cash. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=42.0s)]
*  Crises are by definition times of great volatility, great uncertainty. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=45.2s)]
*  And there is a sense that the US is one of the safest places to be. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=48.72s)]
*  This isn't the first crisis where people around the world have turned to the dollar. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  To understand how we got here, let's go back to New Hampshire in 1944. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=58.0s)]
*  It was towards the end of World War II, and the US got together its allies to work on [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=63.04s)]
*  an international monetary system. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=67.28s)]
*  More than 700 representatives decided to make the US dollar the world's official reserve currency. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=70.0s)]
*  This basically cemented the dollar as the central global currency from that point forward. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=76.12s)]
*  Other countries linked their currencies to the US dollar. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=82.44s)]
*  Even after the official system broke down in the 70s, the dollar retained its influence. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=86.08000000000001s)]
*  It's so widely used around the world today that even if the US economy suffers, the value [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=90.92s)]
*  of the dollar typically won't take a massive hit. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  There's what's called network effects, that the value of the dollar as kind of a key global [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=99.56s)]
*  benchmark for the pricing of goods, the pricing of commodities, for lending, the more people [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=107.04s)]
*  that use it, the more useful it is. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  That's important for people in countries where the local currency is almost entirely [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=114.68s)]
*  dependent on a fragile economy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=118.76s)]
*  Take Lebanon. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=121.84s)]
*  The value of its local currency has plummeted in recent years along with its economy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=122.84s)]
*  Now US dollars are in such high demand, it's almost impossible to get them from ATMs, which [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=128.36s)]
*  has created a black market for the American currency. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  Today more than 60% of all foreign central bank reserves, and nearly 50% of the world's [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=138.28s)]
*  debt is in US dollars. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=144.2s)]
*  For companies and investors, holding assets in dollars, such as treasury bonds, is seen [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=146.64s)]
*  as safe, because the US is the world's biggest economy, and the US central bank is seen as [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=151.92s)]
*  a trustworthy institution. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  Just look at what happened during the 2008 financial crisis. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=160.1s)]
*  The Fed lent out US dollars to other countries through one of the tools in its kit called [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  swap lines. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=167.76s)]
*  Essentially, the Fed gives another country's central bank, say Japan, a loan in US dollars. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=169.72s)]
*  The Japanese central bank gives the US some yen in exchange. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=176.0s)]
*  When the loan period's over, the two countries swap their currencies back and the US collects [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  some interest. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  By April, the Fed had lent nearly half a trillion dollars to central banks around the world. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  That number's come back down, but at its peak, the Fed's most recent currency swaps almost [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=191.44s)]
*  rivaled those of the Great Recession. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  The dollar's dominance gives the US a lot of political power, like through sanctions. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=199.44s)]
*  Since everybody uses dollars, the US can apply pressure on companies or banks from working [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=206.0s)]
*  with anyone who's a sanctioned entity, like a company from Iran or Russia. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=210.92s)]
*  With great power comes great responsibility. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=216.44s)]
*  If you overly abuse the privilege of holding the dominant global currency, eventually the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=218.76s)]
*  world will have to find alternatives. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=226.88s)]
*  And there is some evidence that the world is trying to look for alternatives. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=229.64s)]
*  One threat to the dollar's dominance is China. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=233.72s)]
*  The country's share of the global economy has soared, and Beijing is keen to promote [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=236.64s)]
*  its own currency. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=241.24s)]
*  The long arc of history says that the dollar's dominance won't last forever, and the speed [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=242.88s)]
*  at which the world eventually transitions away from that will in part be determined [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=247.6s)]
*  by how well the US manages its responsibility as the holder and the printer of the world's [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=252.24s)]
*  dominant currency. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=257.96000000000004s)]
*  As panic gripped global markets in March, the dollar spiked higher. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=259.6s)]
*  It's since eased off, and investors have gotten more relaxed, and financial markets [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=263.72s)]
*  have stabilized. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=267.92s)]
*  Maybe the next crisis will be different, but this year has shown that for now, the dollar [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=269.32s)]
*  remains a safe haven for the world. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piNGSrXN78U&t=273.72s)]
