# How Walmart and Target Are Beefing Up Their Store Brand Empires  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw)
*  In the salsa aisle, Walmart's great value brand has long competed with lower price products. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=0.0s)]
*  But now, Walmart is taking on higher priced salsas too, with its new premium grocery brand, Better [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Goods. The retailer is looking to add firepower to a private label empire that already sells the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=10.72s)]
*  biggest store brands in the country. Investing in higher quality store brands is a rising trend [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=16.16s)]
*  among companies, including Target. I'd say that about 30% of the products in this aisle are a [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=21.92s)]
*  good and together brand, a store brand. I visited Walmart's Culinary Innovation Center and spoke [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=27.76s)]
*  with Target's Merchandising Chief to understand why retailers are betting big on making more of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=33.92s)]
*  their own products and what it means for their relationships with the name brands that dominate [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=39.04s)]
*  their shelves. Private label brands, also called store brands, aren't new. For a long time, they've [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=44.16s)]
*  been served up to customers as a low-cost alternative to brand name products. And as [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=52.72s)]
*  inflation continues to put pressure on consumers' wallets, that value play is really paying off. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=56.72s)]
*  In 2023, sales of store brands increased 4.7%, compared to a 3.4% increase for national brands. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=65.52s)]
*  In recent years, retailers have looked to use store brands to create unique and high-quality [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=74.0s)]
*  products too. What role does a national brand play versus private label at Walmart? Yeah, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=78.4s)]
*  well, private label started as a value proposition. So it was a value that was greater than, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=84.0s)]
*  and then it evolved to something that was value greater than, but also quality that was [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=88.64s)]
*  equal or better than. Value isn't just price. Value is about the price plus the quality, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=93.52s)]
*  the fabrication, all of that goes into the value. And customers are noticing. According to a McKinsey [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=100.0s)]
*  survey, most consumers now view private label brands as similar in quality and value to the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=107.28s)]
*  big name brands. In fact, 60% of customers said they would continue to buy private label products, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=112.88s)]
*  even if they weren't trying to save money. Walmart relied on customers searching for a better deal [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=118.16s)]
*  to build great value into the biggest private label brand in the U.S. But in May, it launched [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=122.8s)]
*  better goods in a push to create higher quality private label products. The slightly higher price [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  brand includes products with trendy flavors or ingredients like pistachio and almond gelato or [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=133.28s)]
*  gluten-free taco seasoning. Great value is a consumer goods behemoth and better goods is [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=138.16000000000003s)]
*  a small newcomer. What role does it play? They serve a different purpose. Great value is meant [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=143.44000000000003s)]
*  to be of national brand equivalent. We want to make sure that we have an equivalent in quality [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=148.4s)]
*  that they can offer at a value. Better goods is at elevated lifestyles. To attract new customers, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=152.72000000000003s)]
*  Walmart wants better goods to offer more products that aren't already on shelves instead of just [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=157.68s)]
*  dupes of brand name items. So product developers at the company's R&D center need to compare [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  all the products in a given category. It smells like salsa in here. We will actually look at [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=167.6s)]
*  everything that's in the market. We have to understand where we are from a quality and a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=172.64s)]
*  general assortment. Do we have all the categories and subcategories covered? So I definitely want [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=176.32s)]
*  this one to taste like peach and pineapple, right? So you get that pineapple, especially flavor, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=180.4s)]
*  whereas if you try this one over here, it's just sweet. It doesn't actually taste like the fruit. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=186.0s)]
*  It should be emulating. Yeah, I can definitely tell the difference. Yeah. When you're doing this [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  tasting, though, you're trying to verify that there's a difference between your product [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  and a competitor, right? That it's achieving what you want and that a customer could buy this and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  say, this is better and different, right? Yeah. The biggest thing is, is our quality consistent [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=206.32s)]
*  and is it meeting expectations? Walmart says that more than 60% of customers who bought better goods [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=211.27999999999997s)]
*  haven't purchased any private label product there before. And it plans on ramping up product [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=216.88s)]
*  development with dozens of better goods products hitting shelves in 2025. But more private label [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=221.92s)]
*  products means more competition with big name brands for the same shelf space. At the same time, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=227.92s)]
*  retailers rely on brands like Kellogg's and Coke to draw in shoppers. And those brands rely on [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=233.27999999999997s)]
*  retailers to get their goods in front of customers. National brands and private brands always coexist. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=238.0s)]
*  And I honestly believe that if innovation comes from one side or the other, steel sharpens steel. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  When it comes to the balance of national brands versus private label in grocery at Walmart, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=247.6s)]
*  what's the plan going forward? Give the customer what they want. Sometimes it's that simple. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=252.4s)]
*  They're going to vote with their wallet. They're going to vote with their trips. They're going to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  vote with the purchases they make with us. But it's not just about catering to customers. Selling [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=259.44s)]
*  more store brand goods, whether that's better goods, health brand Equate or clothing brand Time [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=264.56s)]
*  and True also means higher margins. More than 20 of Walmart's brands bring in over a billion dollars [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=268.96s)]
*  annually. There's less invested on the front side. So it allots us to be able to have that value [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=274.72s)]
*  proposition at retail shelf. So there's less money invested on the front side. It's a little [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=279.12s)]
*  higher margin for the retailer. And then ideally it's a better value for the customer. Is that the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  magic combination with consistent quality at target that higher margin drives profit. A portfolio of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=287.68s)]
*  over 45 store brands or what the company calls own brands brings in $30 billion in revenue annually. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=294.0s)]
*  They represent about a third of our sales and even more than that of our profit. So they play a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=300.4s)]
*  really important role from a size and scale perspective. But in addition to that, own brands [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=305.52s)]
*  play an important role strategically. They're driving traffic to our stores, to our site, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=311.2s)]
*  to our app. Target brands have prominent placement throughout stores from the Good and Gather Market [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=316.32s)]
*  to a whole wall of figment kitchen goods to all of this is wild fable. All that all the way over here [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=322.08s)]
*  it's stretching through this entire side of the store. I think it's really important that we show [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=330.4s)]
*  up as a collection around a brand so you can understand what the brand stands for. And if the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=335.84s)]
*  brand speaks to you, you know exactly where to go in the store to find what you're looking for. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=341.2s)]
*  And Target is investing in growth. In 2024, the company launched Deal Worthy, a line aimed at [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=345.52s)]
*  price conscious customers. It also rebranded and expanded its line of essentials up and up. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=350.88s)]
*  Doubling down on private labels comes at a crucial time for Target, which has seen sales slow, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=356.72s)]
*  especially compared to its competitors. Its stock fell more than 20 percent after the company lowered [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=361.44000000000005s)]
*  its quarterly financial targets in November. I think we've got to continue to make sure Target [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  is being Target. And we're using our unique mix of great national brands, our strength in own brands. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=371.44000000000005s)]
*  When it comes to growth and demand, how do store brands help Target in that environment? Q3, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=379.44000000000005s)]
*  as you know, we didn't deliver the results that we wanted to and we can and we will do better. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=386.32s)]
*  But there were a lot of green shoots in the third quarter that are really encouraging as we go [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=391.92s)]
*  forward. And our own brands is one of those. And though discretionary spending is still low, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=396.64s)]
*  the challenge is making sure that we have newness, that it's on trend, that it's on style, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=401.76s)]
*  that it's high quality, and that it's at an affordable price. And when we do that, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=407.2s)]
*  we see the consumer respond and purchase. That newness or making trendy distinctive products [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=412.96s)]
*  is a key part of Target's private label strategy. Take Target's All in Motion, for example, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=419.44s)]
*  where sales grew double digits in the third quarter. This is the everyday soft legging. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=424.23999999999995s)]
*  If you feel it super soft and it's only twenty five dollars, I would hold this legging up to [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=428.96s)]
*  any other legging in the industry. So this is an example where you've made a fabric bet. You've [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=434.79999999999995s)]
*  decided this is a fabric we want to be all in on and let's create products around it that we hope [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=438.88s)]
*  feel differentiated. We have so much consumer insight and so much knowledge about the consumer, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=444.08s)]
*  about fabrication. It's an easy bet to make when you feel this legging. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=449.84s)]
*  Target thinks that that differentiation will set it apart from both national brands and other [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=454.32s)]
*  retailers. I think it's the brands that continue to innovate and to bring new benefits to the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=458.8s)]
*  marketplace are the brands that are going to continue to grow and continue to win. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=463.92s)]
*  That one is definitely spicier. We're sort of doing a weird version of hot ones. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metMoxX9eAw&t=468.88s)]
