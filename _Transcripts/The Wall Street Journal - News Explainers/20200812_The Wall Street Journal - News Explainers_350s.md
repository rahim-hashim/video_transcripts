# The Robot Revolution Is Happening-Like It or Not | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 12, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw)
*  Self-checkout, food delivery robots, entirely automated assembly lines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=0.0s)]
*  Robots have been encroaching on human-led jobs for decades. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=6.44s)]
*  But now, more autonomous workers are being welcomed into businesses than ever before. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=10.44s)]
*  We're getting machines in general the ability to sense. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=16.44s)]
*  We're combining those senses with new and better forms of artificial intelligence. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  One of the hallmarks of the COVID crisis and its aftermath is going to be an acceleration of the deployment of all kinds of automation. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=25.36s)]
*  So what does this mean for the future of the American worker? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=35.92s)]
*  At one FedEx shipping hub in Memphis, Tennessee, it means working with robot pickers. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=40.16s)]
*  FedEx is using these robot arms combined with an AI vision and gripping system in order to one for one replace a human who would normally be picking up packages from one place and putting it under a conveyor belt. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=45.96s)]
*  This so-called pick step is the single most common job at e-commerce fulfillment companies like Amazon, and it's been considered one of the hardest jobs to automate. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  It's really been the holy grail for robotics engineers and artificial intelligence specialists because it turns out that combination of our vision and our flexibility and our dexterity is the one thing that you really can't replace in a warehouse. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=73.08000000000001s)]
*  But these robots are starting to encroach on that territory. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=89.48s)]
*  The effort to reduce human contact at work has accelerated automation in other industries as well. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=93.4s)]
*  Temperature checking robots and mask detecting sensors are policing airports. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=99.4s)]
*  Cleaning bots are sanitizing hospital rooms. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=104.36s)]
*  And outbreaks that meet processing plans have companies racing to develop robot butchers. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=107.16000000000001s)]
*  Industrial robots have been around since really the late 1950s, but they couldn't see and they couldn't sense their environment. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=112.4s)]
*  Made them very dangerous, very strong, very precise, but they had no adaptability. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  They could only do the same task over and over again. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  A lot of the most spectacular work that's been done in the past five, 10 years has all been in terms of vision systems. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=128.84s)]
*  When you give robots the ability to see, suddenly if an object is not in the place that they're expecting it, they can adjust and move and grab it just like we do. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=136.04000000000002s)]
*  These robots combine hardware like cameras and sensors with some form of machine learning software, like the artificial intelligence systems that allow for partial self-driving in a Tesla. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=147.28s)]
*  And so once you have a system that is trained to recognize certain objects or features of objects, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=158.2s)]
*  then it can very consistently and very quickly look at a scene and in real time say like, that's a person, that's a face, that's whose face this is, or this is a package and this is how I should grab it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  Right now, FedEx has four robot pickers. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  Each is half as fast as a human picker. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=179.92s)]
*  But FedEx says they'll become faster once lessons learned during this pilot phase are put into practice. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  Human oversight is still needed to help with sporadic obstacles like a fallen package blocking a sensor. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=187.92s)]
*  But FedEx says those snags are rare enough that one human can simultaneously oversee eight robots. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=193.96s)]
*  And because these robots can work 24-7 and they're consistent, it's okay that they're a little bit slower than humans. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=201.12s)]
*  Even so, there's good reason shipping warehouse workers shouldn't feel threatened by their cobots just yet. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  Demand for home delivery services is exploding across the industry. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=214.72s)]
*  UPS says its average daily shipping volume rose faster this last quarter than ever. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=218.8s)]
*  FedEx says it can't hire fast enough and is short around 500 human positions a night at the same shipping hub that's home to its robot pickers. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=224.12s)]
*  Amazon has invested heavily in automation technologies and even buying companies that do warehouse automation. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=233.08s)]
*  So that's clearly front and center. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=243.48s)]
*  It doesn't seem like it's winnowing the headcount because there's such a growth in demand. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=246.6s)]
*  Mark Murrow has been analyzing the intersection of regional economies and technology for decades. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=252.67999999999998s)]
*  And while he agrees that demand is protecting fulfillment industry jobs for now, he cautions that similar types of work in other industries are not as safe. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=258.96s)]
*  People in routine, non-essential jobs have probably been laid off now. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=268.52s)]
*  And probably would be right to be very concerned about where they will be hired next. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=277.47999999999996s)]
*  And not just because of workplaces transformed by social distancing or robots transformed by sophisticated AI. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=283.84s)]
*  But also, it's looking like we're on the brink of a global recession. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=292.08s)]
*  Companies are looking for new processes and cheaper ways of delivering goods and services. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=296.8s)]
*  So they actually sign up for more automation, not less in downturns. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=303.0s)]
*  Just giving a machine the ability to not just sense its environment, but make sense of that information in some way, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  to identify where is my goal, gives all kinds of robotics these abilities to do things that before were really [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=317.32s)]
*  just the domain of humans or maybe animals. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=326.2s)]
*  In the last decade, a lot of these technologies became ready for prime time. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=330.0s)]
*  And this is prime time now, so I do think we'll see much more accelerated automation. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJNSvKYKvtw&t=335.56s)]
