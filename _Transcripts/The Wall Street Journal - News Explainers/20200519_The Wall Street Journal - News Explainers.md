# How J.C. Penney Fell From the Top of Retail  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 19, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o)
*  This is the JCPenney department store in Hurst, Texas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=0.0s)]
*  Unveiled in 2019, the remodeled store includes [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=5.16s)]
*  style coaches, fitness classes, and a coffee bar. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=8.58s)]
*  It represents the latest strategy that JCPenney [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  has deployed in an effort to draw in customers. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=14.64s)]
*  JCPenney rose to prominence as a national retailer [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=17.76s)]
*  by addressing the middle class. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=20.84s)]
*  But analysts say the retailer's costly shifting strategies [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=22.36s)]
*  have failed to attract the modern middle class customer, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=25.72s)]
*  leading the company to file for bankruptcy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=28.92s)]
*  With so many Americans staying home [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  because of the coronavirus crisis, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=34.0s)]
*  sales across the retail industry have plummeted, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=36.04s)]
*  creating an uncertain future for many retailers. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  Here's how JCPenney fell from the top of retail. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=42.0s)]
*  JCPenney was founded in Kemmerer, Wyoming in 1902 [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  by James Cash Penning. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=50.56s)]
*  The first store was named The Golden Rule [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  and catered to farmers by selling blue jeans [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=54.8s)]
*  and other work wear. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=57.24s)]
*  The retailer changed its name to JCPenney [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=58.72s)]
*  and expanded to locations across the United States. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=61.12s)]
*  JCPenney was quality clothes at a fair price. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=64.32s)]
*  They basically dressed the middle class [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=67.96s)]
*  and they had everything from clothes for kids [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=70.36s)]
*  to career clothes for women and men. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=73.44s)]
*  In 1958, it began allowing customers [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=76.4s)]
*  to make purchases on credit. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  And in 1963, JCPenney released its first catalog. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=81.16s)]
*  Well, they sort of came up during the era [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=85.72s)]
*  when shopping malls were populating the country. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  They were sought after by mall developers to be anchors. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=90.36s)]
*  They developed these private label brands [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=93.92s)]
*  like Arizona Jeans and Worthington [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=96.08s)]
*  that customers just loved. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  The retailer's stock price rose throughout the 1980s [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=100.72s)]
*  and 90s, but with the rise of fast fashion and e-commerce, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=104.04s)]
*  retailers like JCPenney have faced problems [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  in recent decades. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=110.56s)]
*  Particularly retailers in the middle [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=112.36000000000001s)]
*  that were neither high nor low [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=115.0s)]
*  found themselves in distress. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  JCPenney hired former Apple executive Ron Johnson in 2011. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=120.52s)]
*  As CEO, Johnson scaled back promotions [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  and discontinued private brands. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=128.2s)]
*  He had run Apple's retail stores [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=130.72s)]
*  and been very successful making Apple [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=132.84s)]
*  a very hot place to shop. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=135.32s)]
*  He shifted to an everyday low price strategy, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=137.68s)]
*  which sounds good in theory, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=141.12s)]
*  but it turns out customers really like deals. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=142.72s)]
*  Then former Home Depot executive Marvin Ellison [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=146.56s)]
*  took charge in 2015. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=149.48s)]
*  He brought back appliances to the store, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=151.76s)]
*  a product category JCPenney hadn't sold since 1983. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=154.04s)]
*  Appliances, it's a whole different business. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=158.44s)]
*  It takes different, it's different distribution, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  it's different skills, it's lower margin. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=163.04s)]
*  And as Penny really focused on rolling out appliances, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=165.52s)]
*  it took its eye off apparel, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=168.2s)]
*  which is where it makes the bulk of its money. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=169.8s)]
*  Between 2014 and 2018, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=173.0s)]
*  JCPenney only had three profitable quarters. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=176.28s)]
*  Since Jill Soltow took the helm in 2018, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=179.8s)]
*  the brand has been trying to implement changes [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=182.96s)]
*  like those in the Hearst location. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=185.16000000000003s)]
*  Unfortunately, they haven't really had enough time [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=187.16000000000003s)]
*  to see what works and they don't really have the money [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=189.36s)]
*  to roll this out, you know, en masse. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=191.96s)]
*  Its stock had been trading below $1 for long enough [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=194.52s)]
*  that the New York Stock Exchange had notified the company [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=198.84s)]
*  that it was at risk of being delisted. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=201.36s)]
*  And they have been in talks with creditors, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  but you know, they were not able to reach a deal [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=206.8s)]
*  before the crisis. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=209.24s)]
*  In March, JCPenney announced it would be closing [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  all of its stores in furloughing workers [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=213.44s)]
*  in response to the coronavirus outbreak [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  In April, Fitch downgraded the company's bond rating, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=219.44s)]
*  which was already in junk territory. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=222.44s)]
*  And soon after, the company announced [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=224.8s)]
*  it would skip an interest payment owed to bondholders. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=226.68s)]
*  You know, all stores are closed. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  It's lost most of its revenue. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=232.16s)]
*  What is the inventory going to be worth [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=234.08s)]
*  when they can actually get around to selling it? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=236.08s)]
*  I mean, there are a lot of unknowns [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=238.12s)]
*  that just make the whole process more difficult. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=239.96s)]
*  That sort of middle-of-the-road department store [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=242.28s)]
*  has really lost favor. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=245.08s)]
*  And you need to really define who you are. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=247.12s)]
*  This sort of like trying to be everything to everyone [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=249.4s)]
*  is not a game you can play in today's world. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzx5xWsu82o&t=252.16s)]
