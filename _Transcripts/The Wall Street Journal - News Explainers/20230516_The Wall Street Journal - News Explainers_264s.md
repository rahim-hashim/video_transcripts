# How Australia’s New Submarines Fuse Western Military Tech to Counter China | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54)
*  This submarine is what experts are calling the future of underwater defense. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a nuclear-powered attack sub that combines next-gen UK design with classified US technology. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=4.48s)]
*  And it's being built in Australia, where it'll be deployed in the 2040s. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=10.88s)]
*  The US doesn't usually share this type of technology with its allies, so the fact that [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Australia is getting it is a massive deal. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=18.28s)]
*  But the future subs, which are estimated to cost up to $250 billion, have been criticized [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=21.04s)]
*  by China and Russia, who say the vessels risk sparking a nuclear arms race in the Indo-Pacific. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=26.32s)]
*  So here's the secret US technology that will enhance these subs, and how it might be used [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=32.12s)]
*  to counter China's growing influence. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=36.44s)]
*  The SSN Orchis is being built with one key feature in mind – interoperability. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=40.4s)]
*  That's the ability for all three nations to integrate the same technology, weapons [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  and nuclear reactors into their subs. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=49.44s)]
*  To do this, the US will share its highly classified nuclear submarine technology, making the UK [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=52.36s)]
*  and Australia the only two nations to ever publicly receive these systems. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=57.68s)]
*  Australia will also become the seventh country in the world to own these vessels, which have [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=62.04s)]
*  greater capabilities than their current diesel-electric submarines. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=65.68s)]
*  They can go farther, they can generally go faster, and they're quieter as well. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=69.24s)]
*  So there's a big capability advantage in a maritime environment. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  Naval experts say the submarine's design will likely feature a larger hull than Australia's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=78.44000000000001s)]
*  current submarines, housing almost twice as many crew members. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  That crew will operate US combat control systems, which detect the submarine's surroundings [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  and direct its weapons to their targets. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=90.92s)]
*  Alongside US torpedoes, those weapons will include missiles fired from vertical launch systems. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  Experts say these multipurpose silos will be similar to the modules used in US Virginia-class submarines, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  allowing all three nations to use the same US Tomahawk and hypersonic missiles. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=106.36s)]
*  Strapping an American missile into an Australian submarine and having it work absolutely seamlessly [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  would be a great advantage in any military conflict. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=116.96s)]
*  All of these weapons will be conventional, as Australia doesn't have nuclear weapons. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=120.32s)]
*  That means building the nuclear reactors needed to power these subs on its own shores could [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=124.44s)]
*  violate the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=128.92s)]
*  The treaty limits the transfer and use of highly enriched uranium to non-nuclear weapons states. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=132.64s)]
*  So Australia will use what critics have called a loophole for the first time in the treaty's history. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=137.72s)]
*  The power units will instead be built in the UK by Rolls-Royce and enhanced with US technology [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=142.44s)]
*  to make them safer and quieter. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  They'll then be completely sealed before being shipped to Australia. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  This arrangement has sparked concerns from campaigners who want to stop the spread of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=152.83999999999997s)]
*  nuclear weapons, and drawn criticism from China and Russia. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  China has said this could lead to an arms race in the region. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=162.64s)]
*  Obviously the US and Australia deny those claims, but Russia and China do not like this deal at all. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=172.55999999999997s)]
*  That's because of tensions in the Indo-Pacific, where the AUKUS alliance says these subs will be deployed. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=179.6s)]
*  Experts say choke points, including the Sunda Strait and Taiwan Strait, as well as the South China Sea, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=184.76s)]
*  are the primary zones of interest for these subs. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=190.08s)]
*  The way that the US is seeking to counter China in the region is that they're trying to build up the capabilities [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=192.8s)]
*  of their allies, and this is one of the ways that the US is doing that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=198.72000000000003s)]
*  But critics say that all this advanced technology could be obsolete by the time the SSN AUKUS is actually deployed. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=203.16000000000003s)]
*  Experts have pointed to the rapid development of UUVs, or unmanned underwater vehicles, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  as both a challenge to the importance of submarines and an opportunity for their continued relevance. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=214.4s)]
*  You might have one manned submarine controlling a fleet of underwater drones, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=219.84s)]
*  but when you're looking at such a big time frame, 20 years in the future, it's unclear how much of a need there will be. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=224.8s)]
*  That uncertainty, and the significant price tag attached to these vessels, has raised the eyebrows of critics. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  But experts say the high cost shows how important a stronger presence in the Indo-Pacific is for the AUKUS alliance. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  There is a growing recognition that the US cannot do this alone. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=244.84s)]
*  China's been pouring a lot of money and time into its military buildup, and to keep pace with China, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=247.84s)]
*  the US is going to have to seek help from its allies, and Australia really is one of its biggest allies in the region. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI10JplUU54&t=254.36s)]
