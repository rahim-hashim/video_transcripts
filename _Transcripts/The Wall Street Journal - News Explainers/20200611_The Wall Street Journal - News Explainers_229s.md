# Why More Women Have Lost Jobs During the Pandemic | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 11, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k)
*  Emma is a Latina hairdresser. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=0.0s)]
*  As stay-at-home orders went into effect in large parts of the economy shut down, she [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=5.12s)]
*  is among the tens of millions of workers who have lost their jobs in just a couple of months. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=9.72s)]
*  A closer look at data show how that economic pain is distributed among Americans. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=14.0s)]
*  And it turns out that job losses during the pandemic have fallen disproportionately on [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=19.92s)]
*  people like Emma. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=24.22s)]
*  Turns out gender, occupation and race data can help us understand record unemployment numbers. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=26.4s)]
*  It's actually unique to this unemployment crisis that women have been the hardest hit. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=33.4s)]
*  In previous recessions, women tended to fare better than men. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=38.4s)]
*  Men held the dominant share of jobs in sectors like manufacturing and construction, which [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=43.44s)]
*  typically bear the brunt of an economic downturn. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=47.84s)]
*  During the 2009 financial crisis, unemployment among men reached 11.1 percent, compared to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=51.4s)]
*  a peak of 9 percent for women. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=57.26s)]
*  This period also marked the first time in U.S. history that women outnumbered men in [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=60.6s)]
*  the workforce, since many of them had occupations in sectors that were more resilient during [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=64.96s)]
*  a recession, like education or health care. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=69.6s)]
*  Economists say many married women who hadn't been employed also joined the workforce to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=73.6s)]
*  replace or supplement their partner's lost income. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=77.7s)]
*  By 2019, women outnumbered men in the U.S. paid workforce for the second time in history. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=80.8s)]
*  Growth in service sector professions actually allowed women to overtake men as the dominant [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=87.8s)]
*  share of all non-farm payrolls that occurred, you know, at the end of last year. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=94.28s)]
*  But the pandemic has now upended that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=99.8s)]
*  Women account for about 77 percent of workers in occupations that require close personal [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=102.6s)]
*  contact and can't easily be done remotely, which is, you know, a lot of those jobs have [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=110.14s)]
*  been hit by the social distancing measures. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=117.44s)]
*  And so those are jobs in food preparation, health care support, and personal service, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=120.24s)]
*  for instance. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=126.96s)]
*  The unemployment rates for both Black and Hispanic women were higher than the unemployment [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  rate for white women. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=136.28s)]
*  If you dive a bit deeper into the data, you see that those service sector jobs that can't [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=137.88s)]
*  be done from home employ more Black and Latinas. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=142.88s)]
*  For many, working from home is not an option. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=146.76s)]
*  People are having to make very difficult choices between what's best for their economic well-being [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=151.4s)]
*  and what's best for their health and public safety. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=158.16s)]
*  Valerie Wilson is an economist and director of the Race and Ethnicity Program at the Economic [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=162.2s)]
*  Policy Institute. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=166.88s)]
*  She stresses that economic insecurity isn't the only hurdle Hispanic and Black women face. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=168.92s)]
*  Workers of color are in a very difficult predicament based on their position in the labor market [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=175.0s)]
*  and in this economy and society as a whole. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=181.16s)]
*  Latinas show that women tend to spend more time than men with household responsibilities [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=185.48s)]
*  and child care, making job searches much harder. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=189.44s)]
*  On top of that, most Black and Latinas who work in low-paid jobs are also the sole or [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=193.56s)]
*  primary breadwinners in their households, according to a women's rights group. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=198.16s)]
*  Wilson and other economists expect the road to recovery to be even steeper for Black women [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=203.04s)]
*  and Latinas. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=207.6s)]
*  I think getting back to work will be harder for women and women of color in particular [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=208.6s)]
*  because when we recover, the same jobs that were lost probably will not return as quickly. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=215.04s)]
*  So that will be one factor in a slower recovery in those communities. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oUYA3HZ7k&t=222.16s)]
