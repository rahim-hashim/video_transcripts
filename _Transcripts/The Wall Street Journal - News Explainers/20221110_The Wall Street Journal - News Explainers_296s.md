# Why High Inflation Has Lasted for So Long  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos)
*  Last year, policymakers were convinced that inflation would be transitory temporary. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=0.0s)]
*  That's a transitory thing. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  But over a year later, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=7.76s)]
*  I think I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=9.26s)]
*  For most of 2022, inflation lingered above 8 percent, a 40-year high. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=16.2s)]
*  It's affected everything from gas prices to groceries. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=21.56s)]
*  But why has it lasted longer than many experts expected? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=25.04s)]
*  There are a few key factors that propped it up and made it tricky to predict what comes next. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  The first is consumers have more to spend. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=34.44s)]
*  At the beginning of the pandemic, emergency measures from Washington, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  including stimulus checks, loan pauses, low borrowing costs and more, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=40.56s)]
*  flushed the economy with cash. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=45.04s)]
*  And those resources really built up. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=47.04s)]
*  And it was a large stockpile of dry tender that was ready to spend as the economy loosened up. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=49.32s)]
*  This is the U.S. personal saving rate, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=57.64s)]
*  the amount of money households have left over after they spend and pay taxes every month. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=59.92s)]
*  This spike and the ones that followed contributed to $2.3 trillion in extra savings, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=65.04s)]
*  which is one of the reasons consumers have continued to spend as prices have gone up. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=70.48s)]
*  There was pent-up demand. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=75.84s)]
*  Humans are social animals. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=77.0s)]
*  They wanted to go back out to restaurants. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=78.44s)]
*  They wanted to see their friends. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=80.36s)]
*  They wanted to visit families. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=81.6s)]
*  It resulted in more spending, but it also resulted in companies demanding higher prices. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=83.04s)]
*  The Fed estimated that there was still a stock of $1.7 trillion in excess savings in mid-2022. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=89.36000000000001s)]
*  And as consumers have continued spending, companies have been hiring to meet that demand. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=96.2s)]
*  There was just such a demand for workers after the pandemic that companies had a lot of openings [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  for positions that they just couldn't fill in an environment of very low unemployment. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=107.8s)]
*  Here's a chart that helps show just how strong the job market is. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=113.52s)]
*  This is the number of job openings. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=117.36s)]
*  And this is the number of people who are unemployed. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=119.36s)]
*  On the one hand, you have an excess of demand from all the money and household bank accounts. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=121.92s)]
*  And the other is you have a deficit of supply from shortages of not only workers, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=126.64s)]
*  but also goods sourced in global supply chains. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=132.32s)]
*  To help try to fill those vacant positions and encourage workers to stay on, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=136.6s)]
*  businesses have also raised wages. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=140.36s)]
*  Compensation for private and state and local government workers has grown by 5% from last year. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=142.84s)]
*  But when companies raise wages, they often raise prices to make up the difference. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=149.28s)]
*  As wages go up, companies respond by raising prices. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=153.88s)]
*  Well, as prices go up, people say, my cost of living is going up. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=157.24s)]
*  You've got to increase my pay. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=161.08s)]
*  And this process starts feeding on itself. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=162.72s)]
*  But aside from consumer spending power and the labor market, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=165.16s)]
*  inflation has just been a really hard target to hit. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=168.2s)]
*  It's kind of been like watching a game of Whack-a-Mole. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=171.16s)]
*  Every time you see inflation pop up in one area and think you understand it, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=173.72s)]
*  it puts its head down and pops up in some other area. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  Price increases have rippled through the economy at different times. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=181.4s)]
*  In 2021, prices for things like groceries, cars and gas were pushed up by economic recovery from the pandemic. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=185.24s)]
*  Then in 2022, airline tickets rose as well as the war in Ukraine drove up the price of jet fuel. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=192.96s)]
*  And as some of those prices started to ease, housing kept going up as the economy reopened and rents increased. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=199.72s)]
*  So inflation has run right through your home from the stuff you put in your home, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=206.24s)]
*  the televisions and the furniture, the actual cost of living in the home, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=210.52s)]
*  from the goods sector to the services sector, right there in your own day to day life. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=214.88s)]
*  And that bouncing around has made it harder for the Fed to forecast how long policies need to be enacted in order to bring inflation down. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=219.64s)]
*  I just think that the inflation picture has become more and more challenging over the course of this year without question. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=227.2s)]
*  That means that we have to have policy be more restrictive and that narrows the path to a soft landing. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=233.76s)]
*  It's using this instrument that hits certain sectors of the economy harder than others. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  So it raises interest rate, which raises the cost of interest in interest sensitive sectors like housing. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=244.92s)]
*  But it might not hit other parts of the economy where inflation is acute. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=251.84s)]
*  The International Monetary Fund says that interest rate increases have their peak effect on inflation after three to four years. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=256.4s)]
*  Monetary policy has long and variable lags, which is another way of saying it takes time for these effects to work their way into the economy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=263.6s)]
*  And the backdrop to the economy is constantly changing. That's the variable part. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=272.6s)]
*  So it takes time to play through and how it plays through is unpredictable. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  So the story is still unfolding. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=281.8s)]
*  The Fed made another interest rate increase at the beginning of November and said that they may push interest rates higher than originally expected. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezTPNACVVos&t=284.52s)]
