# Returns Are the Retail Industry’s Quietly Mounting Logistics Problem  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc)
*  This 165,000 square foot warehouse is piled high with liquidated goods, including the never-ending stream of things we've all been returning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=0.0s)]
*  Liquidation company QuickLots estimates that about 30% of the products it receives are clearly used returns. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=10.0s)]
*  A little charger watch. This is like a very expensive Swiss watch. Of course, underwear. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=16.0s)]
*  Customer returns are skyrocketing, filling landfills and warehouses like this one to the brim. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=21.0s)]
*  About like this, we estimate to be about 20, $30,000 in retail value. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=27.0s)]
*  So how did it all get here? And how are retailers feeling the impact of an increasing number of unwanted goods? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=32.0s)]
*  When that pair of pants you bought online doesn't fit quite right, the solution is easy. Return it and get a refund. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=39.0s)]
*  But after you mail them back, where those pants end up is a bit more complicated. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=46.0s)]
*  The best of all possible answers is that the good gets repackaged and goes back on the shelf so it's ready for sale as a new item. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=50.0s)]
*  But getting there is costly. Reverse logistics company Optoro estimates that on average, it costs 66% of the price of an item to process its return. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=63.0s)]
*  For example, if those pants you returned were $50, it would cost the retailer $33 to take them back. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=72.0s)]
*  So many returns travel through a complicated web of warehouses, secondary resellers and landfills. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=79.0s)]
*  First up is a returns processing center where the item gets inspected for damage. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=85.0s)]
*  Every company has a different set of standards for what can be repackaged and sold again. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=90.0s)]
*  And plenty of things don't meet them. Optoro says that many retailers threw away over a quarter of returned goods in 2019. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=97.0s)]
*  The amount of returns and excess inventory that retailers send to landfills has more than doubled since 2016 from 4 billion pounds to 9.6 billion pounds. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=105.0s)]
*  But everything else is harder to track. The rest of the unwanted goods filter through our secondary resale market, including retailer outlets and online auctions. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=115.0s)]
*  One path leads to liquidation companies like QuickLots. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=124.0s)]
*  Retailers, their business is to retail. Their business is not to deal with rejected inventory. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=127.0s)]
*  They figure out how to streamline the process by liquidating. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=134.0s)]
*  Companies like Nordstrom, Target and Best Buy send products by the truck full. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=139.0s)]
*  Those trucks are filled with pallets of both customer returns and excess inventory or items that never sold in the first place. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=145.0s)]
*  Everything comes bundled together as liquidation. And a lot of times, even merchandise that are brand new, they could have been returns, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=152.0s)]
*  but they're hard to identify because they got returned with tags in a brand new condition. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=159.0s)]
*  The company sells pallets wholesale, but it also sorts through items by category and condition. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=164.0s)]
*  Its clients are other resellers, from people listing on marketplaces like eBay or Poshmark to mom and pop discount stores to flea market stands. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=169.0s)]
*  And now companies are dealing with even more returns. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=178.0s)]
*  According to the National Retail Federation, customer returns across the retail industry are growing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=181.0s)]
*  As e-commerce sales explode, online returns do too. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=186.0s)]
*  They've more than doubled in the past few years, from 9.6 percent in 2019 to 20.8 percent in 2021. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=190.0s)]
*  So when we shop at a store, we see, feel, smell. We know what we're getting. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=198.0s)]
*  When we shop online, we don't have that sensation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=204.0s)]
*  And so we end up buying more items so that we can see, feel, smell, touch them. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=207.0s)]
*  Retailers themselves have made it easier, with long return windows and free shipping. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=214.0s)]
*  Those policies that especially Amazon created years ago has increased that convenience to the customer. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=219.0s)]
*  And because one retailer started, everybody has to follow suit. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=228.0s)]
*  Emling says retailers would rather eat the cost of returns than disappoint customers. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=232.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, returns still affect consumers. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=237.0s)]
*  Those costs go into the price that they charge for items. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=240.0s)]
*  And ultimately, that cost is borne by us. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=245.0s)]
*  For retailers overwhelmed with returned goods, offloading them to liquidators can be a relief. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=251.0s)]
*  It's a painful process and they just want to get rid of it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=257.0s)]
*  They just want someone else to do it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=260.0s)]
*  And it can be a way to recoup some loss. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=262.0s)]
*  Emling says if retailers think that those goods will end up in a landfill, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=265.0s)]
*  selling them to liquidators instead can be an appealing choice. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=268.0s)]
*  Still, returns eat into the bottom line. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=272.0s)]
*  Retail isn't a high margin business. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=275.0s)]
*  And a large part of that are all of the costs that go into things like returns. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=277.0s)]
*  That is actively cutting into the margins that retailers make. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=284.0s)]
*  But it's tricky to track the actual cost. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=289.0s)]
*  The responsibility is diffused among different groups within the organization. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=292.0s)]
*  Too many companies are not measuring the cost that they're spending on reverse logistics. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=299.0s)]
*  As returns increase, some retailers are changing their policies. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=307.0s)]
*  But it's not widespread. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=311.0s)]
*  Companies that are selling goods that can be found on other websites are going to find it much more difficult. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=312.0s)]
*  Because if I can find the same product somewhere else and it's free returns, that's where I'm going. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=321.0s)]
*  But despite making small shifts, Emling says retailers aren't prioritizing dealing with returned items. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=328.0s)]
*  Right now, consumers have no idea what happens to a return once they, let's say, drop it off at a UPS store. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=334.0s)]
*  Once that becomes transparent, they will change. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuI48MwYMc&t=345.0s)]
