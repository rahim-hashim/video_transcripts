# How GDP Tells Us if We're in a Recession  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 27, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg)
*  There's one big economic indicator that economists pay attention to when figuring out if the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=0.0s)]
*  country is in a recession. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=5.76s)]
*  GDP GDP GDP GDP GDP gross domestic product. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=7.76s)]
*  It's our biggest measure, most important measure. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=12.52s)]
*  The current economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus crisis has many worried that the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=15.08s)]
*  United States has entered into a recession. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=19.84s)]
*  U.S. GDP shrank by a 4.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2020. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=22.52s)]
*  It's the largest contraction of GDP since the last recession and ends the longest economic [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=28.8s)]
*  expansion on record. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=34.0s)]
*  Here's what GDP is and why it's a key measurement to determine whether the country is in a [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  recession. This is the formula the government uses to calculate GDP. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=40.72s)]
*  It tallies all the goods and services produced in the U.S. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  From the dinners we serve at restaurants to the cars we produce in factories and the flights we [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=50.0s)]
*  take from airports. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=54.72s)]
*  According to the Commerce Department, the United States produced over 21 trillion dollars [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  worth of goods and services in 2019. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=61.36s)]
*  Because GDP is a measure of the entire economy and aims to capture almost everything that's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=64.72s)]
*  happening in an economy, economists have chosen the broad definition of a recession as two [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=69.36s)]
*  consecutive quarters of negative growth. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  To calculate GDP, economists first calculate consumer spending or the day to day purchases [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=77.19999999999999s)]
*  that everyday Americans make. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=82.96s)]
*  Consumer spending makes up about 68 percent of GDP. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=85.12s)]
*  And that share has got bigger over time as the U.S. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=89.68s)]
*  manufacturing industry has got smaller. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  Consumer spending fell seven and a half percent in March as businesses shut down and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=94.48s)]
*  government stay at home orders came into effect. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  Americans have continued to spend online, but what they bought online and had delivered to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  their homes hasn't compensated for the loss of other activities since the pandemic started. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=107.44s)]
*  Another major component of GDP is business investment. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=113.36s)]
*  This includes things like companies building factories or buying machinery. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=117.76s)]
*  That's important to the economy not only because of the activity it produces, but also because [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=122.48s)]
*  business investment produces productivity gains. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  For instance, by making factories more efficient or enabling the energy industry to extract more [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  oil and gas. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=135.6s)]
*  Business investment was on the decline before the outbreak and has continued since lockdowns [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=137.28s)]
*  began. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=142.16s)]
*  And there are really two main reasons for that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  The first was the trade war between the U.S. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=145.6s)]
*  and China that created a lot of uncertainty for businesses and their investment plans. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=147.68s)]
*  And the other were oil prices. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=152.56s)]
*  Low oil prices were definitely a deterrent for U.S. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=154.48s)]
*  energy companies to invest in structures and new drills and new wells. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=157.28s)]
*  Government spending also contributes to GDP. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=161.44s)]
*  The U.S. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=164.96s)]
*  government spends money on everything from equipment for the military to government employee [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  payrolls. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  And government spending has continued to rise through the first quarter of 2020. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=171.12s)]
*  And it's going to increase a lot more in the quarters ahead. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  And that's because of the multi-trillion dollar stimulus packages that Congress has passed to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=178.4s)]
*  help stimulate the economy out of its current downturn. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  GDP also adds everything the U.S. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  exports and subtracts everything it imports to calculate net exports. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=188.72000000000003s)]
*  The United States has been importing more than it's exported for several decades. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=194.0s)]
*  In the first quarter of 2020, net exports rose, meaning there was a slight narrowing in the trade [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  deficit. Normally that would be a good thing because it means that the U.S. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=205.36s)]
*  is importing less. However, what we've been seeing is that actually both imports and exports have [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=208.88s)]
*  been falling. It's just that imports have been falling more than exports. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  This is not necessarily a good thing because it shows that demand is very weak. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  Forecasters expect a much larger contraction of GDP in the second quarter, producing the two [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=221.36s)]
*  consecutive quarters of decline that define a recession. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=227.04s)]
*  Lots of economists are predicting declines of about 30 percent or more. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  That is a huge number. It is off the scale compared to what we've seen even in recent [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=235.04s)]
*  recessions. On the other hand, the hopeful scenario is that we see this big job in the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=240.0s)]
*  second quarter and then the economy might start to recover. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-mKagDQDg&t=244.39999999999998s)]
