# Iran Has More Missiles Than Israel Has Interceptors. Now What? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM)
*  For days, Israel's defenses have largely held up against Iran's missile attacks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=0.0s)]
*  But there's a growing concern that Israel is burning through its defensive weapons. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  And its arrow interceptors, which play a key role in taking out Iran's ballistic missiles, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=12.74s)]
*  are in short supply, according to a U.S. official. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=17.04s)]
*  The United States, which has been helping Israel shoot down threats, is also expending [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=20.16s)]
*  its munitions. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=25.0s)]
*  The U.S. official and analysts familiar with the numbers say that Iran has more missiles [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=26.74s)]
*  than Israel and the U.S. have interceptors, raising concerns about Israel's ability to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=31.7s)]
*  defend itself long term. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=36.28s)]
*  So here's what the interceptor shortfall means for Israel, its allies, and the broader Middle [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=38.06s)]
*  East. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=42.94s)]
*  Israel uses different systems to provide a multi-layered defense of its airspace. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=44.86s)]
*  The Arrow 3 is considered the crown jewel of this network. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=49.66s)]
*  At a range of about 1,500 miles, the Arrow 3 is used to counter long-range ballistic [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=53.72s)]
*  missiles, including those that fly above the Earth's atmosphere. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=58.4s)]
*  Arrow 3 has been critical in countering attacks from Iran and Yemen, and it can intercept [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  threats before they cross into Israel's airspace. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=66.32s)]
*  The Arrow 2, an older version of the system, is also used to intercept short to medium-range [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  ballistic missiles. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=74.9s)]
*  Then there's David's Sling, primarily used to counter medium-range ballistic missiles, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=76.56s)]
*  among other threats. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=80.6s)]
*  And finally, the Iron Dome, which is used to shoot down short-range threats like rockets [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=82.24s)]
*  from Gaza. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  Experts say the Iron Dome is not playing a major role in this current conflict with Iran, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  and that the Arrow systems and David's Sling have been key. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  Even though some missiles have slipped through, Israel's layered defense has proven to be [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=96.91999999999999s)]
*  extremely effective. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=100.5s)]
*  Israel says its interception rate for ballistic missiles is about 90 percent, and of the 370 [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=102.84s)]
*  recent days, about 30 have made an impact as of June 17th. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=109.44s)]
*  But as Tom Karakou, the director of the Missile Defense Project at CSIS, put it to me, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=113.84s)]
*  the capability is not the question. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=118.32s)]
*  It's the capacity that matters. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=120.56s)]
*  And capacity could be a huge problem, because arrows play a key role in shooting down not [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=123.72s)]
*  just Iran's ballistic missiles, but also threats from Iranian proxy groups like the Houthis [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=128.22s)]
*  in Yemen. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=134.16s)]
*  In his statement, the Israeli Defense Forces said, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=135.16s)]
*  Israel doesn't talk about how many interceptors it has, because if its enemies knew that number, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  they would know how many missiles to fire at the country. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=149.12s)]
*  The company that makes the arrow interceptors, IAI, did not respond to requests for comment. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=154.6s)]
*  Back in December, Israel's Defense Ministry struck a deal with IAI to make more Arrow [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=159.78s)]
*  However, the arrows are complex missiles that cost more than $2 million a piece and take [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=165.36s)]
*  time to produce. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=170.4s)]
*  Analysts say, in general, defensive weapons are harder and more expensive to make than [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  offensive weapons because they have to be more sophisticated and more precise than the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=176.0s)]
*  missiles they're designed to take out. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=180.4s)]
*  Plus, in some cases, you have to fire several interceptors in order to neutralize a missile. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=182.28000000000003s)]
*  That's why Israel has been focused on taking out Iran's missile and drone capabilities [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=190.44s)]
*  on the ground during its aerial campaign. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  The IDF says it has dismantled more than one-third of Iran's missile launchers. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=197.46s)]
*  But Iran has still been able to launch volleys of missiles at Israel. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=204.84s)]
*  The United States, aware of Israel's interceptor capacity issues for months, has been augmenting [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=208.68s)]
*  the country's defenses. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=213.16s)]
*  We are full of gratitude and thanks for the defensive systems that the United States has [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=214.64s)]
*  put in play. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=218.92s)]
*  There's the ground-based THAAD system, which can intercept missiles inside or outside the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=220.12s)]
*  atmosphere. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=224.68s)]
*  And the U.S. has sent Navy ships into the region, which can counter missiles with SM-2, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=225.68s)]
*  SM-3 and SM-6 interceptors. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=229.72s)]
*  Plus fighter jets can shoot down drones, missiles and other threats. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=232.76s)]
*  And I can say with authority that they have saved hundreds, perhaps thousands of lives [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=237.0s)]
*  over the past four days since Iran has been firing these ballistic missiles into our population [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=240.98000000000002s)]
*  centers. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=246.0s)]
*  But U.S. interceptors aren't unlimited either. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=247.0s)]
*  For example, defense documents show that the U.S. has only procured about 600 THAAD [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=249.48s)]
*  interceptors to date. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=254.44s)]
*  So what does all of this mean for the current conflict in the Middle East? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  We're not looking for a ceasefire. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=259.64s)]
*  I didn't say I was looking for a ceasefire. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=260.64s)]
*  Remember, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=261.64s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=262.64s)]
*  Analysts say that whatever happens, officials need to act fast to end the war because the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=263.64s)]
*  U.S. and Israel can't afford to sit and intercept missiles for an extended period of time. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsoWM7wMQM&t=271.52s)]
