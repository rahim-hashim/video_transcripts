# In the Taliban’s Afghanistan, Signs of a Return to Hard-line Islamic Rule | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 07, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q)
*  In Kabul, streets are full of life. Markets are busy and even amusement parks are open [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=0.0s)]
*  for visitors, including some bemused Taliban fighters. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=7.24s)]
*  This street in the Afghan capital Kabul used to be closed for most Afghan citizens until [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=11.6s)]
*  recently. This is where the Afghan Ministry of Interior used to be and where the European [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=16.8s)]
*  Union's mission was also located. That meant that to get into the street, you had to pass [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=21.16s)]
*  several layers of security barriers. Those barriers have now been taken down as the Taliban [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=26.0s)]
*  try to convey a sense of normalcy in the capital. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=31.32s)]
*  But the situation here is far from back to normal. The economy is on the verge of collapse [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  and many Afghans say they don't know where the next paycheck is going to come from. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=48.6s)]
*  And it's not just the economy. Women's freedoms are being taken away. The Taliban have banned [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=53.4s)]
*  teenage girls from going to school and reintroduced harsh Islamic punishments as they shot and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=58.64s)]
*  then hung a group of alleged kidnappers in Herat. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=64.48s)]
*  So in many ways the reality on the ground here in Kabul is in contrast to the messages [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=68.2s)]
*  that the Taliban have been sending. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=72.92s)]
*  Since the Taliban took control in August, fighters have been patrolling the streets, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=75.92s)]
*  toting guns and manning checkpoints in Kabul. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=79.84s)]
*  Their presence demonstrates military might, but is also a way for the Taliban to convey [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=83.44000000000001s)]
*  that Afghans are safe. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  But a recent spate of attacks is undermining that sense of security. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=99.84s)]
*  In Kabul, a bomb exploded at a mosque in early October, leaving several citizens dead. No [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=104.64000000000001s)]
*  one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=110.36s)]
*  In other parts of the country, the Taliban have been struggling to contain the threat [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=114.08s)]
*  from Islamic State, which has said it was behind deadly roadside bombings. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=117.48s)]
*  Both the Taliban and Islamic State want to impose strict Islamic rule on Afghanistan, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=122.48s)]
*  but have deep religious and political differences. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  The Taliban have been trying to portray a moderate image, but on the ground they've [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=148.96s)]
*  reimposed harsh punishments reminiscent of how they used to rule the country in the late [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=153.44s)]
*  1990s. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=157.88s)]
*  In the western city of Herat, the Taliban killed four men they accused of being kidnappers, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=159.28s)]
*  then hung them from a public square. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=164.28s)]
*  Many Afghans fear the Taliban's hardline rule, especially those who worry that it will threaten [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=167.56s)]
*  basic freedoms. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=172.44s)]
*  Women in particular have borne the brunt of these new regulations. The Taliban initially [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=178.96s)]
*  said that it would allow women to attend school. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=189.52s)]
*  We've seen now that they've banned girls from attending secondary school and women [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=205.48s)]
*  have been sent home from offices. In many provinces of the country, women are no longer [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=209.64s)]
*  allowed to leave the house without a male relative escorting them around the streets. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=214.32s)]
*  Many Afghans fear that the Taliban will ban music like they did in the 1990s. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=221.72s)]
*  Already many Afghans refrain from playing music in public and classes have stopped at [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=227.88s)]
*  the renowned National Institute of Music, which was home to the country's first all-female [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=232.12s)]
*  orchestra. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=236.88s)]
*  As they work out how to govern, the Taliban have been seeking to woo the international [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=248.76s)]
*  community and win diplomatic recognition. However, most countries have stopped short [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=252.3s)]
*  of officially recognizing the Taliban's government and have suspended aid. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=256.5s)]
*  After the Taliban took control, the US, the IMF and other countries also froze Afghanistan's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=261.08s)]
*  foreign currency reserves, which the country is heavily reliant on. And that's had a huge [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=266.4s)]
*  effect on the economy. There's a lack of cash and banks have put a strict limit on how much [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=270.84s)]
*  money people can withdraw. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=276.02s)]
*  That means Afghans don't have enough money to buy the food that they're used to and they [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  don't have enough money to basically keep the economy going. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=282.32s)]
*  Before the Taliban came to power, nearly half the population lived in poverty. But it was [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=287.44s)]
*  rare to see scenes like this of Afghans struggling to find food or queuing up outside ATMs to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=292.28s)]
*  withdraw cash. The UN has warned of growing starvation and pledged 1.2 billion in emergency [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=299.2s)]
*  aid. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=305.76s)]
*  Many people who worked for the former government had lost their jobs, unemployment is soaring [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=306.76s)]
*  and at the same time prices of food and fuel are rising. And Afghans are worried that the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=326.0s)]
*  coming winter is going to be a struggle. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99qhYIGHE7Q&t=331.32s)]
