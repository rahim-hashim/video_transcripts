# Mitch McConnell: How the Senate Leader Leveraged His Power Over 17 Years | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks)
*  One of life's most underappreciated talents is to know when it's time to move on to life's next chapter. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=0.0s)]
*  After 17 years at the helm of the Republican Party in the Senate, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=11.48s)]
*  Mitch McConnell announced he will step down from his leadership role in November. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=15.0s)]
*  I love the Senate. It's been my life. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=19.48s)]
*  There may be more distinguished members of this body throughout our history, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=23.64s)]
*  but I doubt there were any with any more admiration for the Senate. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=27.88s)]
*  Now the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=33.96s)]
*  McConnell cultivated political clout and a reputation as a master legislative strategist. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=38.28s)]
*  But in recent years, he also faced concerns over his health and a changing Republican Party. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=43.96s)]
*  The Senate's going to be a very different place, unquestionably. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=49.0s)]
*  Switch to Mitch for Senate. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=52.84s)]
*  Mitch McConnell was first elected to Congress in 1984, flipping a seat in Kentucky, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=54.84s)]
*  where he holds the title of the state's longest-serving senator. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=59.96s)]
*  He served as the Republican whip for four years before becoming the head of his conference. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=63.88s)]
*  He would be voted leader eight more times across four presidential administrations. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=69.16s)]
*  Mitch McConnell is almost universally respected. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=74.2s)]
*  That's not that he is universally loved. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  Some folks still don't think I spend enough time with Congress. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=80.36s)]
*  Why don't you get a drink with Mitch McConnell, they ask. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=84.36s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=88.68s)]
*  Why don't you get a drink with Mitch McConnell? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=91.48s)]
*  He's either your greatest asset or your biggest liability on literally everything that came before [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=94.28s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  I remember him saying sort of tongue in cheek, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  It's taken me 30 years to convince everybody I'm an asshole. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=108.6s)]
*  I'm not going to turn back now. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=112.52s)]
*  Wielding brass knuckle tactics to push his agenda, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=116.44s)]
*  McConnell didn't aim for public popularity or shy away from controversial opinions. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=119.24s)]
*  Our top political priority over the next two years should be to deny President Obama a second term. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=125.0s)]
*  He is perfectly comfortable being the most unpopular person that he can be. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  His view is he's not doing his job if you like him. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=137.48s)]
*  There are no good decisions you can make in that role [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=141.48s)]
*  that's going to satisfy a 60% majority of Americans. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=144.44s)]
*  Just not. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=148.2s)]
*  With a decades-long tenure comes many legislative highs and lows for McConnell. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=149.4s)]
*  This is a guy who watched John McCain cast the decisive no vote on the repeal of Obamacare, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=154.36s)]
*  a heartbreaker for the Republican Party. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=162.28s)]
*  Shortly after that, McConnell was able to deliver on passing a $1.5 trillion tax cut, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=167.48s)]
*  the largest structural overhaul of the tax system in more than 30 years. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=174.44s)]
*  Probably from a legislative perspective, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=179.48s)]
*  this signature accomplishment of the entire Trump presidency. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=181.64s)]
*  Some of McConnell's achievements will last for years to come. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=186.12s)]
*  During the Trump administration, he pushed through the confirmations of more than 200 [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=189.48s)]
*  judicial nominees, including 53 on appeals courts and three on the Supreme Court. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=194.04s)]
*  In 2016, McConnell refused to hold confirmation hearings for then-President [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=199.72s)]
*  Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  We're not giving lifetime appointments to this president on the way out the door to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=208.2s)]
*  change the Supreme Court for the next 25 or 30 years. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=212.92s)]
*  In October 2020, with Trump in the White House, McConnell and Senate Republicans [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=216.76s)]
*  confirmed Amy Coney Barrett to the high court just days before the presidential election. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=221.48s)]
*  A lot of what we've done over the last four years will be undone sooner or later by the next election. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=226.2s)]
*  They won't be able to do much about this for a long time to come. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  The appointment was met with strong criticism from Senate Democrats. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=238.92s)]
*  They subjected Judge Garland to an unprecedented partisan blockade, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=243.0s)]
*  but they're erecting a monument to hypocrisy to rush Judge Barrett onto the bench. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=247.8s)]
*  McConnell has cemented a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for at least a generation. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=253.48s)]
*  One of the greatest challenges McConnell has faced during his tenure is the rapidly changing [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=260.6s)]
*  Republican Party, shifting away from more traditional conservative values and moving [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=265.32s)]
*  toward former President Donald Trump's populist brand of conservatism. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=270.04s)]
*  Believe me, I know the politics within my party at this particular moment in time. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=274.44s)]
*  I have many faults. This understanding of politics is not one of them. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=283.0s)]
*  Many of McConnell's legislative wins came during the Trump administration, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  but the pair had a relatively tumultuous relationship. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=292.91999999999996s)]
*  McConnell has this idea that to win in politics, you must sit and stand firm, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=296.28s)]
*  and that's absolutely what he did with President Trump. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=302.59999999999997s)]
*  And that's not to say it was always easy. That's not to say it came without any toll, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=305.56s)]
*  but it did speak to McConnell's sort of internal toughness and ability to persevere [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  as qualities that were important to his leadership. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=316.68s)]
*  Things really fell apart, though, between McConnell and Donald Trump after January 6th, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  when McConnell did not vote to convict President Trump, but got up and gave a very, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=324.44s)]
*  very impassioned speech in public view on the Senate floor. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=329.32s)]
*  There's no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=333.08s)]
*  for provoking the events of the day. No question about it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=342.68s)]
*  McConnell's decision to step down follows a series of health setbacks [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=349.64s)]
*  after the leader appeared to freeze during two public appearances. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  All right, I'm sorry, you all, we're going to need a minute. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=358.35999999999996s)]
*  The Senate minority leader, who turned 82 on February 20th, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=360.67999999999995s)]
*  said it's time for a new season in his life. He will step back from the leadership role in November, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=364.59999999999997s)]
*  but plans to remain in the Senate until his term expires in 2027. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=370.28s)]
*  McConnell has been a very strong, centralized leader at a time when rank and file members [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=375.32s)]
*  want more power to be devolved at into their hands. And so it could mean a weakening of [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=380.67999999999995s)]
*  the Senate Republicans leadership. It's very, very hard to see someone else who's going to [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=387.79999999999995s)]
*  bring together all of those different skill sets, the mastery of the Senate rules, the mental and [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=394.03999999999996s)]
*  emotional toughness to produce the same type of leadership that we saw with the Senator McConnell. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=400.03999999999996s)]
*  I have full confidence in my confidence to choose my replacement and lead our country forward. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=406.2s)]
*  And if you look at what he has done with his leadership from the moment he walked into that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=413.24s)]
*  office to the moment he walks out, what he's ultimately done has been the most consequential [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=420.12s)]
*  figure over the longest period of time of any Senate leader in history. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXvbtpv-ks&t=425.72s)]
