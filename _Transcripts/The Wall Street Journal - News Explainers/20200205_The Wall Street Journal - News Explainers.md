# How Aramco Became the Biggest Company in the World  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 05, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64)
*  This map shows the major infrastructure of Saudi Aramco, the world's most profitable [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=0.0s)]
*  company. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=7.76s)]
*  The dark spots clustered to the east are deep reservoirs of oil and natural gas, the lifeblood [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=8.76s)]
*  of Aramco's business and the global economy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  For nearly a century, Aramco's oil has powered cars, planes and industries, and electrified [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=17.68s)]
*  homes around the world. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=23.16s)]
*  In 2018, the company produced 13.6 million barrels of oil a day, more than any other [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=24.92s)]
*  company. Then in 2019, Aramco's IPO valued the company at 1.7 trillion in the world's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=30.64s)]
*  biggest ever public offering. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=38.32s)]
*  But the forces that propelled Aramco's growth from a single well to the biggest producer [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=40.64s)]
*  in the world are changing underfoot. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=45.52s)]
*  And some analysts say the company won't be able to sustain the kind of growth it will [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=48.32s)]
*  need to keep investors happy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=51.92s)]
*  To understand these changes, you have to understand how Aramco got so big in the first place. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=54.919999999999995s)]
*  The company was founded in the 1930s on a barren tract of desert with no natural river [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=63.4s)]
*  or body of water and little vegetation. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=68.08s)]
*  It was completely pre-modern. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=71.44s)]
*  I mean, it really looked basically like it had since the 1700s, the 1800s. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=73.2s)]
*  The kingdom's leader, Ibn Saud, was low on cash to fund development. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=78.88s)]
*  So in 1933, he struck a deal with an American oil company. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=83.28s)]
*  Standard Oil of California, or SOCal, won the right to search for oil near the eastern [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=86.92s)]
*  coast in Alhasa. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  Five years and several dry wells later, SOCal and its partner Texaco hit oil. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=93.92s)]
*  A lot of it. Quickly, well number seven was producing commercial quantities, around 4000 [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=99.36s)]
*  barrels of crude oil a day. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=105.56s)]
*  Workers began construction on a pipeline to the sea. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  By spring of 1939, the SOCal tanker D.G. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=111.92s)]
*  Schofield docked at Ras Tanura and filled its first shipment of oil to leave Saudi [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=115.0s)]
*  Arabia for the global markets. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  The country with nothing to sell had found what everyone wanted to buy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=122.2s)]
*  Over the following decades, the American group found more and more mineral wealth [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  beneath the Saudi sand. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=130.96s)]
*  By 1970, that oil would play a crucial role in a market halfway around the world, a [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  market so big it would lift Aramco's profits and push Saudi Arabia to alter the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=138.16s)]
*  future of oil markets everywhere. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=142.32s)]
*  What happened is that in 1970, Texas tapped out. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=146.68s)]
*  After more than a century of growth, U.S. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  oil production began to fall. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=153.72s)]
*  At the time, Americans were driving to work in gas guzzlers like these. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=156.24s)]
*  The average fuel consumption for this type of vehicle was 13 and a half miles per [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=160.84s)]
*  gallon. To fuel these cars, the U.S. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  turned overseas. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=167.24s)]
*  You can see it on this chart, which shows the country's imports of crude oil. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  Aramco, still an American company, had plenty of oil to sell. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  Wald said that between 1972 and 1973, production grew from 5.4 million to 8.4 [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=178.68s)]
*  million barrels a day. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=185.8s)]
*  According to Aramco, in 1971, shipments of crude oil and petroleum products from [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=187.72s)]
*  Ras Tanura had surpassed one billion barrels a year. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and other oil producing nations took notice of all this demand. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=196.72s)]
*  OPEC, this organization of petroleum exporting companies, which had been [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=201.84s)]
*  created in the 60s but didn't do anything for years. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=205.28s)]
*  They would essentially negotiate with the big international oil companies like [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  Exxon and BP and Shell. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=212.84s)]
*  And then they would negotiate a price for oil. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=214.76000000000002s)]
*  And they were basically selling all of their oil to these international [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  companies that had distribution outlets around the world. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=220.0s)]
*  And 1973 comes along and the countries say, you know what, we know what's [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=223.2s)]
*  happening with demand. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=228.32s)]
*  We know that we're supplying most of your market. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  We need a higher price for oil. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  When OPEC tried to raise prices, the international companies said no. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=233.83999999999997s)]
*  So Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ahmad Zaki Yamani, took a different approach. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=238.48s)]
*  Right at that exact same time was the Arab-Israeli War. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  And a lot of the countries in OPEC wanted to basically help out their fellow Arab [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  countries by raising the price of oil and both embargoing it to the countries [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=253.36s)]
*  that were helping Israel, namely the United States and its allies. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=259.08s)]
*  And the Saudis were actually the least interested in doing this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=262.24s)]
*  But once it became clear that they could negotiate and increase the price of oil, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=265.44s)]
*  Yamani looked at the situation and said, we can use this political situation to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=269.24s)]
*  our advantage. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  Here's Yamani in December of 1973. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=274.92s)]
*  When the Israelis accept to withdraw from the occupied territories and the U.S. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=277.4s)]
*  government guarantees their decision, then immediately we can lift the embargo. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=286.84s)]
*  This could happen anytime. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=295.88s)]
*  The plan worked. This chart shows the U.S. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  price for oil before and after the embargo. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=301.32s)]
*  President Nixon said the gas crisis has dissolved into a problem, but it's a [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=304.64s)]
*  problem millions of motorists are still trying to cope with in long lines at [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=308.56s)]
*  their local gas stations. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=312.08s)]
*  While America was reeling from the price shock, Saudi Arabia was making plans to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=314.48s)]
*  increase its control of Aramco. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=318.44s)]
*  That year, the kingdom set a deal to buy 25 percent of the company. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=321.2s)]
*  And that was really when the tables turned. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=325.8s)]
*  And it was very clear that it was no longer these big international oil [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=328.52s)]
*  companies. It was no longer the Americans. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  It was the Saudis that controlled their oil and controlled their commodity. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  And shortly after that, in 1974, they negotiated to buy another percentage of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=340.56s)]
*  the company. In 1976, they had more negotiations that led to them eventually [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  completing the purchase for all of Aramco in 1980. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  Aramco is now fully owned by the Saudi state. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=354.24s)]
*  From this point forward, Saudi Arabia, along with OPEC, would exert enormous [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  control over the price of oil everywhere. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=362.0s)]
*  In the early 80s, the company set forth on a period of rapid expansion that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=365.20000000000005s)]
*  would take Aramco beyond the kingdom's oil fields and borders to new markets [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=369.04s)]
*  around the world. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  Ali Aon-Neyimi became the first Saudi CEO of the company. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=377.8s)]
*  So it was his vision that diversified and really integrated the company and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=381.04s)]
*  turned it into something that could make money in all parts of the value [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=385.04s)]
*  chain, not just the pumping the oil out of the ground. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  So they first went to Korea and they negotiated with the South Koreans and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=391.6s)]
*  they started a joint oil refinery called S Oil in South Korea. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=395.12s)]
*  They also negotiated in Japan and they also have a big oil storage facility [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=399.04s)]
*  in Japan. Then finally, they got to China and they have several joint [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=404.20000000000005s)]
*  ventures in China for refineries and petrochemicals. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=408.68s)]
*  The timing was right to capitalize on a surge in demand for oil. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=412.4s)]
*  Here's a look at China's GDP over those decades. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=416.35999999999996s)]
*  They set up in Asia at exactly the moment when Asia took off as a consumer [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=420.71999999999997s)]
*  and they were really well positioned. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  And in fact, Saudi Arabia is currently the largest oil supplier to China [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  right now. By the 2000s, it was a global conglomerate, positioned to profit [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  from a historic rally in oil prices. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=435.08s)]
*  Supply disruptions in the Middle East and demand in emerging markets like [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  India drove the price to new heights. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=441.28s)]
*  Price spikes are becoming a way of life in the United States. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=444.23999999999995s)]
*  Geopolitical certainty in a number of countries in the Middle East and [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=447.84s)]
*  Africa will continue to keep markets on edge. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=451.0s)]
*  Gas prices are hitting new highs. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=454.88s)]
*  We got to live with it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=457.32s)]
*  They're going to keep going up. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  In 2008, the price of oil hit a record high of $147. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=460.91999999999996s)]
*  In the decades since that peak, many of the factors that led to a Ramco's [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=466.55999999999995s)]
*  rise have shifted. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=470.4s)]
*  For one, the U.S. came back online as a major oil producer. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=472.2s)]
*  By 2008, U.S. producers had found new ways to extract oil from places they [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=476.28s)]
*  had thought were tapped out, as well as some new areas. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=480.44s)]
*  Production surged. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=483.71999999999997s)]
*  This is Nansen G. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=485.56s)]

*  producers have done, though, is extraordinary. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=491.64s)]
*  And with the benefit of new engineering capabilities, especially the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=495.92s)]
*  fracking capabilities, they're able to produce significant amounts of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=502.32s)]

*  Meanwhile, cars and homes have become more efficient, curbing growth in [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=515.6s)]

*  energy sources. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=533.08s)]
*  And the new world is all about clean BTUs, clean energy. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WQ903lu64&t=534.72s)]
