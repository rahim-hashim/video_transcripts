# Musk Said He'd Cut $2T. How Much Did DOGE Actually Save? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8)
*  Elon Musk is officially done with the Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=4.68s)]
*  After leading Doge for only a few months, the billionaire CEO of Tesla is now no longer [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=8.88s)]
*  a special government employee. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=14.4s)]
*  His aggressive cost-cutting at Doge, though, has left a big impact. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=17.96s)]
*  Doge has created just an enormous amount of backlash. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=22.68s)]
*  Doge dismantled entire agencies, canceled billions of dollars in contracts, and helped [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=27.08s)]
*  the White House fire thousands of federal workers. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=32.04s)]
*  It was like the worst day of my entire federal career. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=34.68s)]
*  The agency has also faced mounting criticism over its lack of transparency. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  Doge's wall of savings has been highly unreliable, riddled with numerous errors. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=45.0s)]
*  So what did Musk and Doge actually accomplish? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=51.72s)]
*  And what's next for the agency without Musk? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=55.2s)]
*  During the election, Musk said Doge could save... [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  We can do at least $2 trillion. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=63.32000000000001s)]
*  By March, Musk reduced that projection. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  Our goal is to reduce the deficit by a trillion dollars. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=70.16s)]
*  The numbers that they initially threw out seemed really far-fetched. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=73.88s)]
*  Romina Bocha studies federal budget and spending at the Libertarian Cato Institute. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=77.36s)]
*  In order to cut that kind of spending, Doge would have had to reform major and popular [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=82.52s)]
*  entitlement programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=88.36s)]
*  And those programs had already been taken off the table by President Trump. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=93.28s)]
*  By the end of May, Doge claimed to have saved a much smaller number, $175 billion. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=97.48s)]
*  Its wall of receipts claimed $32 billion was saved for more than 10,000 contract terminations, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=104.56s)]
*  and $40 billion for more than 15,000 grant terminations. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=111.68s)]
*  In February, the Journal analyzed $7 billion in canceled contracts posted to the Doge site [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=116.56s)]
*  and found the actual savings were closer to $2.6 billion. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=122.92s)]
*  The problem is that this wall of receipts has had a number of errors in it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  It's been difficult to really know how much the federal government is actually saving. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=130.96s)]
*  Doge's contract and grant terminations add up to about $72 billion. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  But that still leaves more than $100 billion from other areas, with an untold number saved [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=141.52s)]
*  from quote, workforce reductions. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=147.76s)]
*  A Doge spokesperson didn't respond to emails requesting comment. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk has got to go! [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=154.16s)]
*  Many of the widespread layoffs across the federal government that Doge kicked off are [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=156.68s)]
*  being held up by the courts. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=161.04s)]
*  And his forceful approach has led to behind-the-scenes friction between Musk and some of Trump's cabinet. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  We have seen lawsuits filed on a number of fronts to protect federal workers who were [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  fired to the attempt by Doge to access certain databases within the federal government. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  The first employees fired at many agencies were probationary employees. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  The Office of Personnel Management made a decision for all agencies to fire all probationary [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=187.92s)]
*  employees in the federal government because they considered them to be temporary employees. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=193.32s)]
*  Jeffrey Grant oversaw a department of 600 workers, which ran HealthCare.gov, the Affordable [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=198.76s)]
*  Care Act website. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  86 of Grant's employees were terminated in February, shortly after he announced an early retirement. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=206.0s)]
*  We had IT people. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=212.11999999999998s)]
*  We had health policy experts. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  We had operational experts. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=215.76s)]
*  We had communications experts. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=217.4s)]
*  It was a blow on a work level, but it's also a blow on a personal level. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=219.6s)]
*  Grant says 30 of his employees were brought back because they were either deemed actually [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=225.8s)]
*  necessary or they were erroneously fired. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=229.96s)]
*  On March 11th, nearly half of the Department of Education's employees received reduction-enforced [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=234.44s)]
*  notices as part of President Trump's goal to dismantle the department. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=239.84s)]
*  Sharia Smith has been an attorney for the Department of Education's Office for Civil [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=244.20000000000002s)]
*  Rights since 2016. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  She also heads a union that represents nearly 3,000 department employees. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=250.56s)]
*  Our workforce, our members, received emails, including me, that we were impacted by a reduction [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=254.88s)]
*  in force. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=259.68s)]
*  And then immediately that day, they deactivated our key cards and made plans to take away [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=260.68s)]
*  all of our work equipment so that we could not perform any work. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=266.48s)]
*  On May 22nd, a federal district judge in Massachusetts ordered the Trump administration [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=270.6s)]
*  to reinstate the fired Department of Education employees. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  She wrote, there is no evidence that the reduction in force has actually made the department [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  more efficient. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=283.76000000000005s)]
*  If we don't do this, America will go bankrupt. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=285.04s)]
*  With Musk stepping back from Doge as the legal fight continues over massive layoffs, budget [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=288.44s)]
*  hawks in the Trump administration want to keep cutting. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=293.36s)]
*  Doge has been a paradigm shift in Washington, D.C. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=296.6s)]
*  One of the biggest proponents of Doge in the Trump administration is the director of Office [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=300.4s)]
*  of Management and Budget, Russ Vogt. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=305.0s)]
*  We intend to take the Doge agenda and the cuts and the momentum and the initiative and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  turn those into permanent savings. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  Now that Musk is moving off to the side, we expect Vogt will play an even more central [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  role ensuring that the cuts that Doge has identified become codified into law. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=322.28s)]
*  Russ Vogt has long had a goal of significantly downsizing the federal government and has [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=329.16s)]
*  also been the power behind the throne when it comes to Doge. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=336.04s)]
*  As head of OMB, Russ Vogt sent Congress a budget that proposed $163 billion in non-defense [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=340.32s)]
*  spending cuts, or 22.6 percent of current year spending. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=347.0s)]
*  The $163 billion which they identified is very similar to the roughly $170 billion that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=351.08s)]
*  Doge has identified. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=358.58000000000004s)]
*  But at the same time, they want to increase defense spending and they don't want to touch [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=360.22s)]
*  Medicare or Social Security. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=365.06s)]
*  Ultimately, reducing spending is a prerogative of the Congress. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=366.98s)]
*  The bill is passed. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=371.78000000000003s)]
*  In May, House Republicans passed a thousand-plus page budget known as the Big Beautiful Bill. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=374.76s)]
*  Musk said the bill undermines Doge's work by not making enough cuts. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=380.78000000000003s)]
*  I was like disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=385.38s)]
*  budget deficit, not just decrease it, and undermines the work that the Doge team is doing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=391.73999999999995s)]
*  The Senate still needs to pass the bill, but Republicans said they hope to get it on the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=396.41999999999996s)]
*  president's desk by July 4th. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=400.7s)]
*  In an April Tesla earnings call, Elon Musk said he would start spending far more time [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=403.85999999999996s)]
*  on running his electric car company. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=408.9s)]
*  My rough plan on the White House is to be there for a couple days every few weeks and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=410.7s)]
*  to be helpful where I can be helpful. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=417.9s)]
*  The impact of Doge's cuts are still playing out across the country. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=419.62s)]
*  Doge is now part of every federal agency. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=423.58s)]
*  They have brought people into every one of these federal agencies with a budget-cutting [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=426.7s)]
*  mindset. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=432.9s)]
*  They are people who are really true to the cause of Doge. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=433.9s)]
*  If the public sees fewer services, if they see real bottlenecks in their ability to access [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=438.70000000000005s)]
*  Social Security, for example, all of that will affect the way the public views Doge [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=444.66s)]
*  in the months ahead. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRmHoCtTg8&t=450.1s)]
