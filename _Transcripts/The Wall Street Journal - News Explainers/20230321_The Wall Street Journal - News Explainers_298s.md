# Assad's Grand Plan to Reunite Syria With the Arab World | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE)
*  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is being welcomed back into the fold of some Arab nations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=0.0s)]
*  after having been shunned by most world leaders for more than a decade. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=6.68s)]
*  His brutal crackdown on anti-government protests in 2011 triggered a civil war that's still [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=11.98s)]
*  going on. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=17.34s)]
*  The conflict led to sanctions against the Syrian government by its neighbours and Western [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=19.82s)]
*  nations. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=24.5s)]
*  But in recent weeks, fuelled by a devastating earthquake, Assad has been rebuilding diplomatic [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=25.86s)]
*  ties and asking for economic reprieve. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=31.54s)]
*  From walking the red carpet in Oman, to meeting Egypt's foreign minister, here's how Assad [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=35.36s)]
*  has shifted his image and what it means for the Middle East. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=41.5s)]
*  A devastating earthquake hit Turkey and Syria in February. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=46.82s)]
*  While most of the casualties were in Turkey, more than 6,000 died in Syria. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=51.1s)]
*  Assad's government said Western sanctions from the war hampered its rescue efforts. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=56.54s)]
*  Within hours of the earthquake taking place, there was a meeting of top-level Syrian officials [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=61.06s)]
*  in Damascus and the idea was now we're going to leverage this at two levels. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=65.78s)]
*  The first one, lobby against sanctions for the end of sanctions, not just exemptions. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=70.7s)]
*  And two, we're going to use it as a tool to sort of get our Arab neighbours or other [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=76.42s)]
*  Arab countries to get closer to us. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=82.1s)]
*  The earthquake appears to have given Assad momentum as he seeks to capitalise on the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=85.9s)]
*  humanitarian disaster to reduce his isolation. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=90.26s)]
*  In the days following the disaster, representatives from countries including the United Arab Emirates, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=93.54s)]
*  Egypt and Jordan visited Syria. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=100.1s)]
*  So really you could see that war was already ongoing as the repression sort of accelerated [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=102.62s)]
*  at that stage. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=107.18s)]
*  Assad also made only his second state visit since 2011 to Oman, a country that never broke [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=108.18s)]
*  ties with Damascus. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=114.54s)]
*  European and Arab officials said Syria's president used the trip to lobby for the removal of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=116.58000000000001s)]
*  Western sanctions and return for keeping crossings into rebel-held areas in Syria open. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=121.94s)]
*  Assad's efforts to restore ties have been building since the Arab League, a group of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=128.38s)]
*  22 nations, suspended Syria when war broke out in 2011. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=132.98s)]
*  In the past few years, the Syrian leader has beat back rebels with the help of Russia and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=147.1s)]
*  Iran. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=151.85999999999999s)]
*  Both countries remain key partners to the regime. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=152.85999999999999s)]
*  Assad arrived in Moscow in March to hold talks with President Vladimir Putin to develop cooperation [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=156.38000000000002s)]
*  between the two countries. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=162.62s)]
*  And Syria has been working with its neighbours to curb the rise of terrorist groups and the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=164.94s)]
*  trade in the illicit drug Captecon. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=169.94s)]
*  For a number of countries in the region there were already some kind of conversation on [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=173.46s)]
*  counter-terrorism, obviously because of the presence of the Islamic State and other groups [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=177.10000000000002s)]
*  affiliated or close to Al-Qaeda. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=181.54000000000002s)]
*  So there was already some very sort of discrete engagement that accelerated because of Captecon, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=184.58s)]
*  because of this illicit drug that started really to flood the region from Syria into [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=190.22s)]
*  countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Jordan. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=194.46s)]
*  Now a deal is being brokered between Assad and some Arab nations, including Jordan, to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=199.70000000000002s)]
*  help Syria more formally reintegrate. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=205.02s)]
*  It could benefit the region for a number of reasons. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=208.22000000000003s)]
*  The prime concept is stability. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=211.34s)]
*  If you have a country in the region where there's no rule of law and everything is sort [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=212.98s)]
*  of collapsed, like we had at times in Somalia or in Libya, it has implications for the rest [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=218.66s)]
*  of the region. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=224.73999999999998s)]
*  And that's what they want to avoid. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=225.73999999999998s)]
*  I think they want to avoid another Libya. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=226.73999999999998s)]
*  Somalia's central government has struggled for more than a decade to contain terrorist [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=228.89999999999998s)]
*  attacks from the Al-Qaeda-linked group Al-Shabaab. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=233.29999999999998s)]
*  And Libya has been in turmoil since long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=237.01999999999998s)]
*  For Syria, all of Assad's diplomatic efforts come against the backdrop of the long-drawn-out [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=243.98s)]
*  civil war, which has spanned over 12 years. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=249.85999999999999s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of people have died, and the conflicts created the world's largest [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=253.78s)]
*  refugee crisis, according to the United Nations. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=259.18s)]
*  But even as the war continues and Arab countries bring Assad back into the fold, convincing [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=262.5s)]
*  the West to ease tensions will be more difficult. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=267.7s)]
*  A sanctions programme, which is not ready, again, under this scenario to end, would be [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=271.38s)]
*  potentially an impediment for Arab rapprochement. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=276.22s)]
*  While the UN said the status quo of isolating Syria cannot continue. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=279.5s)]
*  There needs to be a coordinated international effort in support of this, with all key players [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=284.98s)]
*  working in a coherent effort. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBlrluEdOE&t=291.3s)]
