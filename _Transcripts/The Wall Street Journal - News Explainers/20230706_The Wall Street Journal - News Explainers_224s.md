# What’s Blocking Sweden’s NATO Membership? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo)
*  Sweden wants to join NATO as soon as possible. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=0.0s)]
*  The Nordic country applied for a membership at the same time as Finland last year, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=4.0s)]
*  shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=8.36s)]
*  But while Finland was accepted this April, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=12.32s)]
*  Turkey and Hungary are blocking Sweden from joining. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=15.36s)]
*  Let's look at what's holding up the process [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=18.8s)]
*  and what Sweden can bring to the Western military alliance. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=21.16s)]
*  Sweden is strategically located next to NATO's newest member, Finland. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=25.4s)]
*  If Sweden joined NATO, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=30.84s)]
*  troops would be able to go through Swedish territory into Finland [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=32.64s)]
*  to defend the 800-mile-long border with Russia. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=36.08s)]
*  Those two countries, along with Norway and Denmark, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=39.28s)]
*  form a type of Nordic fortress in northern Europe, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  which helps NATO shore up its defences against Russia, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=45.44s)]
*  both over land but also at sea, the Baltic Sea. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=49.4s)]
*  The Baltic Sea is the shortest direct waterway from Russia to the West. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=53.96s)]
*  This is where Sweden's Gotland Island is located. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=58.64s)]
*  NATO often conducts military exercises here, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=61.96s)]
*  and the island could be used as a base to protect its naval forces in northern Europe. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=64.64s)]
*  By joining NATO, Sweden also reinforces the alliance with weaponry. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=69.64s)]
*  It has surface-to-air missiles, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=74.12s)]
*  which will help NATO bolster its air defences in this region. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=76.08s)]
*  In addition, Sweden also has submarines for the Baltic Sea, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=80.68s)]
*  and they have a deep knowledge of Russian affairs, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=85.16000000000001s)]
*  having been so closely located to Russia for decades, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  in a way that many European countries haven't. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=90.48s)]
*  For centuries, Sweden avoided taking part in military conflicts, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  but the country has worked closely with the alliance in the past. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  Sweden has had a close partnership with NATO for several decades, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  going back to the mid-1990s, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=104.44000000000001s)]
*  where Sweden was part of the NATO mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=107.4s)]
*  And then since then, it has participated in various NATO missions in Afghanistan, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=111.92s)]
*  and it's been part of what's called an enhanced opportunity partnership. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=118.04s)]
*  But Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  made Sweden rethink its policy of non-alignment. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=126.4s)]
*  Russia opposes NATO membership for Sweden and Finland, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=130.4s)]
*  and said this would have consequences. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=133.72s)]
*  Swedish and Finnish intelligence services [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=136.04s)]
*  are prepared for increased cyber attacks, increased espionage. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=138.44s)]
*  They say they're not concerned about direct military action at the moment, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=142.92s)]
*  but Russia has threatened both countries [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=146.96s)]
*  that there would be consequences if they joined NATO. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=149.76s)]
*  Every NATO member needs to approve Sweden's application to join. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=153.12s)]
*  Hungary and Turkey are against it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=157.68s)]
*  Hungary's parliament says it's because of what it calls [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=160.44s)]
*  unwarranted Swedish criticism of its democratic record, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=163.4s)]
*  while Turkey accuses Sweden of sheltering Kurdish militants [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=167.16000000000003s)]
*  that Ankara considers to be terrorists. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=171.44000000000003s)]
*  Sweden made a number of concessions to Turkey to address these concerns, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  including passing a new anti-terrorism law. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=177.56s)]
*  In parliament, they made it illegal to be a member of a terrorism organisation, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  and that includes the PKK, which is a Turkish militant group [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=184.8s)]
*  that Sweden also labels as a terrorist organisation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=188.72000000000003s)]
*  Hundreds of people protested in Stockholm against the new law, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=192.68s)]
*  saying the Swedish government is bowing to Turkish pressure. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=196.76000000000002s)]
*  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked Sweden to stop the protests [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=201.68s)]
*  before he can agree to the membership. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=206.4s)]
*  NATO's secretary-general called a meeting with Sweden and Turkey [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=209.36s)]
*  to try and sort out the issues [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=213.28s)]
*  before the alliance holds its summers in Lithuania in July. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrOXMZjx7zo&t=215.4s)]
