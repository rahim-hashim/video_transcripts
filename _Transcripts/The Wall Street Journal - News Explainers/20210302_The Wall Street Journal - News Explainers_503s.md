# How a $15 Federal Minimum Wage Might Affect the Economy | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 02, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw)
*  No one should work 40 hours a week and live in poverty. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=0.0s)]
*  We will not rest until we pass the $15 minimum wage. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=3.5s)]
*  Nonpartisan experts say it would send more people to the unemployment line than it would [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=8.64s)]
*  lift out of poverty. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=13.68s)]
*  The debate over whether to raise the minimum wage has long been a political sticking point [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=15.4s)]
*  in Washington. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=19.96s)]
*  11 years after the last increase of the federal minimum wage to $7.25 an hour, lawmakers have [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=20.96s)]
*  introduced legislation that would raise it over time to $15 by 2025. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=27.68s)]
*  This would more than double it, bringing the minimum wage to its highest level ever when [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=33.22s)]
*  adjusted for inflation. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=37.44s)]
*  This uncharted territory has raised questions about its effects on jobs, businesses, and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=39.64s)]
*  the economy overall. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=44.4s)]
*  To understand the potential impact of such an increase, the Wall Street Journal asked [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=46.4s)]
*  two economists, as well as a minimum wage worker, what the risks and benefits of a $15 [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=50.22s)]
*  minimum wage would be. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=55.24s)]
*  21-year-old Portia Van is a minimum wage worker in Fayetteville, North Carolina. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  She took a job in food service in April 2020 after she lost her full-time nanny position [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=62.6s)]
*  due to the coronavirus pandemic. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=67.4s)]
*  She has become active in the Fight for 15 movement advocating for higher wages. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=69.88s)]
*  I can't even, you know, put a roof over my head because of my job pay. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=74.28s)]
*  It's not even about the job. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=80.12s)]
*  How much the job is paid. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=82.08s)]
*  For workers like Portia Van, a $15 minimum wage would put more money in their pockets. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=83.64s)]
*  A report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that raising the minimum [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=88.74s)]
*  wage could give 27 million workers a pay bump. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=92.54s)]
*  But the report also says phasing it in would cost the economy about 1.4 million jobs, as [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=96.28s)]
*  businesses shed workers due to increased labor costs. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=101.94s)]
*  However, economists vary widely in their own assessments of how many jobs would be lost [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=105.56s)]
*  and what the costs and benefits may be. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=109.74000000000001s)]
*  University of Massachusetts Amherst economist Aaron Dubey says the low-wage labor market [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=112.72s)]
*  is able to absorb higher wages with little negative impact on jobs. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=117.5s)]
*  We can go up to even 70 or 80 percent of the median wage, so the minimum wage can be that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=121.42s)]
*  high and still have relatively limited impact on jobs. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=127.66s)]
*  But more than three-quarters of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal in February [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=132.44s)]
*  said a $15 minimum wage would cost the U.S. jobs, with most saying the job loss would [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=135.88s)]
*  be less than 1 million. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=140.48s)]
*  Michael Strain studies the U.S. jobs and labor market at the conservative-leaning American [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=142.54s)]
*  Enterprise Institute. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=146.46s)]
*  He believes the impact on jobs could be greater than the CBO's estimate. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  An important factor here is whether or not the magnitude of job losses grows as the size [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=151.56s)]
*  of the minimum wage increase grows. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=160.72s)]
*  The effect on employment of a large increase is larger than the effect on employment of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=163.62s)]
*  a more modest increase. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=169.88s)]
*  A 15 to 15 would be more than doubling the current federal minimum, and the evidence [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=172.08s)]
*  for what happens when you do that is much more limited because that's a policy change [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=176.72s)]
*  that we really haven't seen. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=184.24s)]
*  And seeing how much you really make in these jobs and how much work you put into it has [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=187.84s)]
*  really affected me very negatively because now I'm having to struggle to make ends meet [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  Proponents say that a higher minimum wage would alleviate the financial struggle that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=202.16s)]
*  many low-wage workers face. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=205.92s)]
*  The CBO report also says that a $15 minimum wage would lift 900,000 Americans out of poverty. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=207.94s)]
*  I also find that a higher minimum wage leads to less reliance on food stamps and other [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  public assistance. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=220.84s)]
*  So roughly $0.35 on the dollar ends up actually as taxpayer savings. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=222.56s)]
*  I have been thinking about going onto food stamps so that I could at least save some [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=228.96s)]
*  type of money because I won't be able to afford to eat every day and pay the rent. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=236.44s)]
*  A $15 minimum wage would mean less stress to me because I would know that I had more [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=242.76s)]
*  money coming in to where I didn't have to stress about if I'm able to get this or if [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=250.72s)]
*  I'm able to get that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=255.56s)]
*  Well, I don't think the minimum wage is a particularly effective tool in fighting poverty. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=256.76s)]
*  And the reason for that is that a lot of poverty comes from people not having jobs. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=262.88s)]
*  And if you don't have a job, then the minimum wage increase is not going to help you to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=268.4s)]
*  take it out of poverty. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=273.68s)]
*  But some economists agree there are more targeted policy tools to alleviate poverty, like the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=275.2s)]
*  earned income tax credit. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=279.92s)]
*  Unlike the minimum wage, the earned income tax credit is very well targeted on low income [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=281.8s)]
*  households. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=287.56s)]
*  And because the earned income tax credit increases the financial rewards from working, it actually [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=288.56s)]
*  increases employment by drawing people into the workforce. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=294.64s)]
*  However, when more people are searching for jobs, that tends to put a downward pressure [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  on wages. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=303.32s)]
*  By setting a floor, the minimum wage prevents that wage reduction from taking place, thereby [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=304.64s)]
*  working well together as policies. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=311.28s)]
*  Another finding in the CBO report is that higher wages would increase the costs of producing [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=313.79999999999995s)]
*  goods and services, and some of those costs would be passed on to consumers in the form [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=318.11999999999995s)]
*  of higher prices. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=322.28s)]
*  Overall, what this means is that middle and higher income consumers end up paying for [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  raising wages for those at the bottom. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=331.47999999999996s)]
*  I think that's a feature, not a bug. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=334.08s)]
*  As to how high businesses can raise their prices. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=337.6s)]
*  And so they'll have to figure out other ways to absorb the additional labor costs. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=341.16s)]
*  One way they might absorb it is through hiring workers who have relatively more skills or [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=347.68s)]
*  relatively more experience. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=353.44s)]
*  Those workers will be relatively more productive than the minimum wage workers that they had [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=355.68s)]
*  previously employed. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  But opponents have said higher wages could force some small businesses to close. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=363.68s)]
*  If a company is not strong enough or has not brung in enough profit to pay their employees [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=368.16s)]
*  a reasonable amount that's above poverty, then I don't think that they should be open [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  at all. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=381.44s)]
*  Proponents of the increase have pointed to the benefits a higher minimum wage can bring [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=383.24s)]
*  to reducing the racial income gap. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=386.52s)]
*  Currently, black workers disproportionately earn minimum wage relative to their share [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=389.04s)]
*  of all hourly workers. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=393.68s)]
*  Recent research published by economists at the University of California, Berkeley, has [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  found the extension of the minimum wage in 1967 can explain more than 20% of the reduction [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=399.92s)]
*  in the racial earnings and income gap during the civil rights era. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=405.44s)]
*  Any policy that tends to increase wages at the bottom will generally also tend to help [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=408.96s)]
*  people of color more because more low wage workers tend to be people of color. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=415.92s)]
*  President Biden says a minimum wage increase would deliver raises for low wage workers, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=421.36s)]
*  many of whom were deemed essential during the COVID-19 pandemic. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=425.6s)]
*  But opponents, including many Republicans in Congress, say the minimum wage will increase [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=429.44s)]
*  labor costs for restaurants, stores, and small businesses already reeling from a battered [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=433.36s)]
*  economy. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  Polling has shown that more than two-thirds of Americans are in favor of a $15 minimum [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=439.6s)]
*  wage. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=444.04s)]
*  I think the most compelling thing about timing is how long it's been that we have not raised [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=445.12s)]
*  the federal minimum wage. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=451.28000000000003s)]
*  Having said that, I don't think I would support a very large increase in the minimum wage [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=453.44s)]
*  this year. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=459.44s)]
*  We can pass the policy and phase it in over a number of years to deal with any uncertainties [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=460.6s)]
*  about the recovery from the COVID crisis. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=466.48s)]
*  Now is the perfect time because anybody in any field who's going out every day to risk [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=470.24s)]
*  their lives and, you know, to bring whatever they're bringing to the community, I feel [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=477.36s)]
*  like they should get paid more. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  Economists acknowledge that raising the minimum wage to $15 will come with both costs and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=488.52s)]
*  benefits and that it's important to acknowledge these trade-offs when considering the policy. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHLX73_qziw&t=492.68s)]
