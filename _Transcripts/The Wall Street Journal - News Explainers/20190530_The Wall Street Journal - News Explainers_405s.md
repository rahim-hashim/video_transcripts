# How Drug Prices Work  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 30, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y)
*  You might think the process that determines how much you pay for something is pretty straightforward. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=0.0s)]
*  And it often is. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  For example, here's the supply chain for a beverage you might buy at the drugstore. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Say a Pepsi. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=12.1s)]
*  PepsiCo manufactures the soda and sends it to a retailer who sells it to a customer. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=13.76s)]
*  The customer pays the retailer and the retailer pays PepsiCo. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=19.48s)]
*  Simple, right? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=23.66s)]
*  Well, that is not the case for the products behind the pharmacy counter. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=24.66s)]
*  The drugs. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=29.28s)]
*  Here's a typical supply chain for prescription drugs. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  It looks really different. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=35.34s)]
*  That's because the way that drugs are priced is not at all a straightforward process. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=37.88s)]
*  Experts and politicians argue that the very complexity of this chain is part of why drug [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=42.8s)]
*  prices have grown so high for customers. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Everyone involved in the broken system, the drug makers, insurance companies, distributors, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=51.44s)]
*  pharmacy benefit managers, and many others contribute to the problem. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=59.08s)]
*  To understand this debate, first you should understand the flow of drugs and money within [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=65.92s)]
*  this chain. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=70.54s)]
*  Let's start here, with the pharmaceutical companies. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=72.56s)]
*  They're the ones who develop a drug and set a price, known as the list price. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=76.16s)]
*  This isn't as straightforward as it might look, which we'll explain in a moment. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=81.08s)]
*  First you have the wholesalers who transport the drugs and sell them to the pharmacies. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=85.52s)]
*  The patient pays the copay and the pharmacy sends out a bill that gets paid by the insurance company. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=90.52s)]
*  That's simple enough, but we're missing a link. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=96.52s)]
*  The link that manages this transaction and adds a lot of complexity to the chain. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=99.32s)]
*  Meet the pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=105.08s)]
*  They're who the drug companies and some politicians are talking about when they refer to middlemen. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=109.8s)]
*  They work for insurance companies, big employers, and government agencies. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=115.04s)]
*  And a big part of their job is to bring down the cost of drugs for their employers. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=119.94000000000001s)]
*  They do this by negotiating with pharmaceutical companies for rebates. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=125.44000000000001s)]
*  Yep, for many of the drugs a pharmaceutical company sells, it pays a rebate to the PBM. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  The PBM sometimes pockets a portion of the rebate and passes another portion onto the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=136.6s)]
*  insurance company or employer. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=141.36s)]
*  Why the pharmaceutical company pays these rebates is the source of a lot of controversy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=144.32s)]
*  What happens is the drug company gets moved up on something called a formulary. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=152.64s)]
*  So what's a formulary? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  It's the list of drugs that the insurance company covers. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=160.72s)]
*  And it's grouped in tiers. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=164.42s)]
*  Each tier represents what portion of the list price the patient pays and what portion of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  the list price the insurance company pays. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=171.84s)]
*  The highest tier in the formulary is the lowest copay for the patient. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  And the lowest tier is the highest copay for the patient. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=180.68s)]
*  When the pharmaceutical company pays a higher rebate, the PBM will move the drug up on the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  formulary. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=191.52s)]
*  Pharmaceutical companies want high placement on the formulary. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=193.68s)]
*  That's because patients are more likely to take the drug that's most affordable. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=197.56s)]
*  And that usually means higher sales for the pharmaceutical company. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=201.52s)]
*  If a patient wants to take a drug that's lower down on the formulary or not on it at all, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  they have to pay higher copays or even the full list price of the drug. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  If this seems confusing, that's because it is. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=216.04000000000002s)]
*  Let's take another walk through that transaction, this time with an example. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=220.0s)]
*  Say a hypothetical drug costs $100. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=224.84s)]
*  A PBM negotiates a $50 rebate, $10 of which they pocket and $40 of which they pass on [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=228.92s)]
*  to the insurance company or employer. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=235.64s)]
*  In return for that rebate, the PBM moves the drug to a better spot on the formulary, making [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=238.72s)]
*  it cheaper for the patient to buy the drug. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=243.72s)]
*  This transaction is important because the pharmaceutical companies say it's a big reason [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=247.2s)]
*  they keep raising the price of drugs. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=251.76s)]
*  You've probably seen a chart like this before. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=256.0s)]
*  It's the rise in the price of a drug in the U.S., in this case, Humalog, according to its [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=259.04s)]
*  maker Eli Lilly. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=264.52s)]
*  The pharmaceutical companies say they have to raise list prices to protect their sales [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=266.36s)]
*  and profits from the demands of these higher rebates. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=270.62s)]
*  Here's the CEO of the pharmaceutical company Merck at a hearing on drug prices. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=274.52s)]
*  If you bring a product to the market with a low list price in this system, you get punished [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=279.72s)]
*  financially and you get no uptake because everyone in the supply chain makes money as [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=286.68s)]
*  a result of a higher list price. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=292.20000000000005s)]
*  And here's that Humalog chart again, this time with the net price, or the average revenue [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=295.08000000000004s)]
*  that Eli Lilly says they take in under this system. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=300.56s)]
*  For their part, the PBM say the drug companies don't have to raise prices to boost their [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=306.48s)]
*  bottom lines and that rebates reduce the cost of drugs, not inflates them. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=311.24s)]
*  They say rebates reduce the real cost of prescription drugs because they lower the price that insurance [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=316.82s)]
*  companies pay. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=322.06s)]
*  That helps the insurers lower the premiums that the patients have to pay for their plans. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=324.0s)]
*  Here's Derricka Rice, an executive vice president at CVS Caremark, one of the pharmacy [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=329.8s)]
*  benefit managers. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=334.70000000000005s)]
*  Our job is to work with the employers, unions and government programs we serve to ensure [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=336.16s)]
*  that when their members get to the pharmacy counter, they get the medicines that they [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=341.6s)]
*  need at the lowest possible cost. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  So what does all of this mean for the patient back at the pharmacy counter? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=349.24s)]
*  At the heart of all this is that what the patient pays is often based on the list price, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=354.64000000000004s)]
*  not the price the insurance company is responsible for after the rebates. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=361.04s)]
*  For patients who don't have insurance or co-insurance or who have really high deductibles, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=365.78s)]
*  sometimes pay the entire list price. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=372.05999999999995s)]
*  It's important to know that the details surrounding rebates are shrouded in mystery. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=374.97999999999996s)]
*  Pharmaceutical companies and PBMs don't release their rebate data saying it's proprietary. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=380.97999999999996s)]
*  But it's clear that different people and different insurance companies pay different prices for [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=386.9s)]
*  the same drugs. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=391.78s)]
*  As you can see, the way that prices work behind the counter is totally different from [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=394.02s)]
*  how they work in front. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeG2lWxYO_Y&t=399.15999999999997s)]
