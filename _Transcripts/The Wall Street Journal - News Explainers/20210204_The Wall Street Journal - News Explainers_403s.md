# Amateur vs. Professional Points of View on the GameStop Trading Frenzy  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 04, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE)
*  Hi, I'm Steve Sosnick. I'm the Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=0.0s)]
*  My name is John Hagedorn. I work in the self-storage industry. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=3.92s)]
*  I've been with the firm for over 25 years. I've been in the markets for [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  several more before that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=11.6s)]
*  I got involved in investing because I wanted to make my money work for me [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=12.96s)]
*  and provide a better life for my family. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=16.32s)]
*  I try to get as many points of view as I can. I subscribe to the Wall Street Journal. That's not [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=30.0s)]
*  just for your plug. That's because it's been a necessary part of my day for quite a while. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=40.24s)]
*  I really don't pay that much attention to the stock market if I'm being perfectly honest with [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=45.2s)]
*  you. I'm more of a set it and forget it type of investor. Most of my positions are long. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=49.84s)]
*  When I am interested in the more minutiae and the day-to-day goings on in the stock market, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=55.12s)]
*  I typically will turn to Wall Street bets because it's where the flavor of the day [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=62.48s)]
*  type of stuff is going on. I saw a post from DFV early in January where he basically showed [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=67.36s)]
*  that GameStop was massively shorted. At that point, the stock had started rising pretty steadily. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=74.08s)]
*  That was really what led a lot of people and myself to take a closer look and to jump in. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=81.44s)]
*  The best way to describe Wall Street bets, it is a degenerate hive for gambling on the stock market. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  That's not an insult. Many people that frequent Wall Street bets will [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=97.76s)]
*  willingly tell you that and wear it as a badge of honor. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=101.68s)]
*  I describe the Reddit forum Wall Street bets as the latest in hundreds of years of human beings [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=104.32s)]
*  trying to get together and discuss their investments. They did it in coffee shops [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=111.52s)]
*  in Amsterdam and London. They did it under a buttonwood tree in colonial New York. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=118.55999999999999s)]
*  They're doing it now on Wall Street bets. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=123.28s)]
*  No, I think what's discussed on Wall Street bets should be more chatter among friends [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=124.96s)]
*  rather than actual advice. I think that in any time you're getting investment advice, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  you should figure out what is motivating the person who is giving that advice. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  It's tough to know because Wall Street bets is pure unadulterated gambling chaos. You don't know [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=149.76s)]
*  what somebody's angle is on there. You don't know if somebody's trying to pump a stock or dump a [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=157.36s)]
*  stock. You don't know what their goal is. But with that being said, sometimes some interesting [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=161.68s)]
*  financial advice gets posted there. If you are interested, do your own research. Go take a look. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=167.76s)]
*  This is publicly available information. And if you like what you see, take a position. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=174.4s)]
*  There's never really been quite so much focus on let's stick it to the man or let's, you know, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=183.68s)]
*  let's bring these guys down. I think what we saw on Wall Street bets over the past few weeks is [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  really not all that different than a guy in a Viking hat running through the halls of the Capitol. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=195.44s)]
*  It's in many ways a similar type of stick it to the man type of sentiment. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=202.0s)]
*  There's no wizard behind the curtain directing everybody what to do. It is pure unadulterated [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=207.68s)]
*  raw mob mentality. Okay, you go in there and you can see at any given moment on Wall Street [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=214.48s)]
*  bets there's a million different people talking about a million different things. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=219.44s)]
*  I don't know that this is outright manipulative. And you do have to wonder how many people were [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=222.48s)]
*  using Wall Street bets to entice others to help out their investments rather than trying to help [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=234.72s)]
*  others make money through their investments. There's nothing market manipulating about a [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=244.64s)]
*  totally anonymous democratic internet forum where people can go and post what they think [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=251.6s)]
*  is good and what they think is bad and what you should and shouldn't do. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=256.8s)]
*  I'm not allowed to comment for that on the record, but let me explain something that goes on that is [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=264.08s)]
*  not well understood. That is a feature of markets, not a bug. It was perceived as the clearing houses [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=269.76s)]
*  or the brokerage firms turning over the monopoly board just as the little guy was winning in favor [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=278.24s)]
*  of the big guy. I think it's a lot more complicated than that. I would need to know more about exactly [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  what happened at Robin Hood. Why did the CEO of Robin Hood go all over the place, all over media [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=294.32s)]
*  and do a ton of TV interviews and claim that this wasn't an issue of lack of funds on their part, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=300.24s)]
*  and that they were doing it to protect retail buyers and doing it to protect their customers? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=308.64s)]
*  There was no liquidity problem and to be clear, this was done preemptively. So we're really in [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=315.04s)]
*  unprecedented times and in order to protect the firm and protect our customers, we had to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=321.68s)]
*  limit buying in these stocks. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=329.2s)]
*  The best thing we could do is all be educated better. Everybody. I could be educated better. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=338.24s)]
*  I learned about the little weirdness in short selling just last week. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=360.16s)]
*  Everybody, the more education that's out there, the better. Never stop learning. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=365.76s)]
*  First and foremost, there needs to be just a hard, hard look at exactly what mechanisms and tools [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=370.48s)]
*  hedge funds use when they're shorting companies. Things like that have to be cleared up. Retail [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=377.76s)]
*  investors and investors in general have to feel that it's a level playing field. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=384.32s)]
*  And right now it certainly doesn't feel that way. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEnVNTSODYE&t=388.96000000000004s)]
