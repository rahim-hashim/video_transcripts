# How Airbnb Fell From Successful Startup to Crisis Mode  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 22, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8)
*  2020 was supposed to be the golden year for Airbnb. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=0.0s)]
*  It was supposed to be the year that Airbnb went public. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=5.88s)]
*  They were supposed to be the hottest offering of this year. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=10.0s)]
*  In just under a decade, Airbnb went from a single air mattress for rent to a global company [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=14.0s)]
*  valued at more than $30 billion. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=19.56s)]
*  The home sharing giant has thousands of employees, over 3 million hosts and 7 million listings [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  in over 220 countries. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=29.32s)]
*  It even branched out with a new division called Experiences, which allows guests to book outings. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=31.96s)]
*  But travel is now at a standstill. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=38.32s)]
*  Airbnb's planned listing is in doubt. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=40.56s)]
*  Expected revenue is down by at least half, and CEO Brian Chesky said 25% of staff will [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=43.52s)]
*  be cut. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=49.72s)]
*  So how did one of the most successful startups of the decade become such a vulnerable company? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=51.32s)]
*  Airbnb was founded in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  A lot of ordinary people had lost their jobs and were looking for secondary income. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  Once the idea of sharing your home with someone took off, a lot of people bought into that promise. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=68.48s)]
*  You know, we had revenue from day one and we didn't actually need to raise money at [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=74.68s)]
*  any given point. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=80.08s)]
*  We decided that we invest ahead of growth and we've always tried to think about it [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=81.08s)]
*  so that we could at any given point throttle into profitability. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=85.84s)]
*  Airbnb was profitable by a certain measure in 2017 and 2018. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  So that gave investors a lot of confidence and excited everyone really about the prospect [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=97.4s)]
*  of a startup like this that has become a household name around the world to go public. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  The company spent big during this period of growth. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=109.16s)]
*  Administrative costs increased 113% between 2017 and 2019 as they hired thousands of employees [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=112.0s)]
*  and built out a corporate headquarters in a trendy San Francisco neighborhood. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=119.52s)]
*  Then, 2019 ended with a tragedy. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=123.8s)]
*  Airbnb now says it is banning house parties. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=127.4s)]
*  That after a shooting left five people dead in San Francisco in a suburb there on Halloween night. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=131.2s)]
*  This mass shooting was really a moment of reckoning for Airbnb and that's what led [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=135.6s)]
*  them to invest over a hundred million dollars into safety initiatives. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=141.2s)]
*  These expenses helped bring Airbnb's total costs to five point three billion dollars [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=147.0s)]
*  last year, more than double what they were in 2017. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=152.2s)]
*  You had board members grilling some of the executives and saying, hey, your costs are [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=155.88s)]
*  outpacing your revenue growth. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  Let's rein that in. Let's control that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  And then, of course, the pandemic hit and changed everything for Airbnb. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=165.0s)]
*  China says the number of people infected by a mysterious respiratory virus has more [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=170.12s)]
*  than tripled over the weekend. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=175.0s)]
*  In January, officials in China issued local travel warnings and restrictions following [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=177.04s)]
*  the spread of COVID-19. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=181.68s)]
*  It wiped out bookings overnight in China. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  So remember at the time, no one thought this would become a global problem. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  And then, on March 11th, President Donald Trump announced new international travel restrictions. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=193.08s)]
*  As Airbnb bookings fell, Chesky held in-person meetings with employees to discuss what these [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=199.52s)]
*  new developments meant for Airbnb and their plans to go public. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=204.68s)]
*  What was happening was a lot of anxiety was building among employees because a lot of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  them have stock options and those are set to expire later this year, which meant that [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=213.4s)]
*  if they didn't go public this year, a lot of valuable options that employees hold would [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=219.12s)]
*  just be worthless. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  So Mr. Chesky really took it upon himself to reassure employees to say, it's going [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=226.44s)]
*  to be okay. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=231.72s)]
*  We are still very much going to list this year. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=232.72s)]
*  That changed in a matter of days. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=237.0s)]
*  By the end of March, he struck a more cautious tone. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=239.96s)]
*  He held a video conference with employees where he said everything is on the table. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=245.0s)]
*  Around this time, many guests began to demand refunds for reservations. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=251.4s)]
*  But Airbnb had a longtime practice of allowing hosts to set their own cancellation policies. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=256.08s)]
*  But in a world where you have guests fighting back and saying, hosts are not giving us any [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=262.59999999999997s)]
*  refunds, what's Airbnb going to do about it? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=267.47999999999996s)]
*  I think that really shook the company as well. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=270.44s)]
*  This led to a sudden decision by Chesky to give guests refunds for certain bookings. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=274.36s)]
*  After backlash from some hosts, Chesky issued an apology to them. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=279.56s)]
*  I am sorry. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm sorry we didn't consult you as partners. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=285.44s)]
*  And I've heard from you ever since that decision. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  Airbnb said it would pay hosts 25 percent of what they would have received for canceled [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=291.36s)]
*  bookings. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  They also created a 17 million dollar mortgage fund to help top rated hosts cover mortgages. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  By April, the company had barely any revenue coming in from short term stays. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=303.12s)]
*  So they ended up raising a billion dollars in debt at a very high interest rate that [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=308.36s)]
*  is associated with distressed assets. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=315.2s)]
*  So overnight, Airbnb went from being this Silicon Valley unicorn that is a household [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=318.54s)]
*  name around the world to being reduced to business that is in distress. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=326.32s)]
*  On May 5th, Brian Chesky announced massive staff cuts in a memo that has drawn praise [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=332.16s)]
*  for addressing the impending layoffs with compassion and clarity. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=337.08000000000004s)]
*  Chesky said nearly 2000 employees, a quarter of Airbnb's workforce would be cut. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=341.36s)]
*  He also said 2020 revenue would be less than half of what it was in 2019. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=347.2s)]
*  I think everyone would be very surprised if they choose to go public later on this year. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=352.52000000000004s)]
*  What I'm hearing from investors is that Airbnb would need at least two good quarters before [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=359.36s)]
*  they go public. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=366.64000000000004s)]
*  The pandemic has shifted Airbnb in fundamental ways. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  The company is pivoting to long term stays and recently rolled out cleaning guidelines [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=371.32000000000005s)]
*  to help guests feel safe whenever they do return to rentals. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=375.88s)]
*  The sudden collapse of the Airbnb economy that was a lifeline for many has also exposed [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  deep cracks in the sharing economy. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=385.64000000000004s)]
*  If you think about it, Airbnb is really a property manager without the property risk. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=388.18s)]
*  Unlike hotels that run and manage their properties, Airbnb doesn't own any of the properties. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=395.4s)]
*  The pandemic has really held a mirror and has really made us all question the very fundamentals [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=401.76s)]
*  of the sharing economy. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=408.84s)]
*  Who takes on the risk? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-y69rCGx_8&t=411.47999999999996s)]
