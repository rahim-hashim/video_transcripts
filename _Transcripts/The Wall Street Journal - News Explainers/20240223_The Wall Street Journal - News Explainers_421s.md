# OpenAI’s Sora: How to Spot AI-Generated Videos | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [February 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA)
*  Do you notice anything off in this animated video of a cooking grandmother? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=0.0s)]
*  Notice the magic spoon that randomly appears and then randomly disappears. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=4.0s)]
*  Flaws like that can help viewers spot AI-generated videos from OpenAI. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=10.5s)]
*  Its new text-to-video tool Sora created all of these clips, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=15.5s)]
*  from scenic landscapes to bedazzled zoo animals [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=19.5s)]
*  without a major production studio or team of animators. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=22.5s)]
*  When you think about some of the most recent Pixar movies, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=26.0s)]
*  when you think about the amount of energy that they go into, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=28.5s)]
*  to literally build every detail so that their hair moves in the right way. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=31.0s)]
*  This stuff now is a computer doing without a single person. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=36.0s)]
*  Users will be able to type in a prompt and their words are brought to life, like this. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=40.0s)]
*  But such innovation has raised concerns about the spread of misinformation. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=45.0s)]
*  So being able to detect AI in video has become even more important. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=49.0s)]
*  We'll share some tips on how to spot AI videos [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=53.5s)]
*  and look at how this technology could be abused. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=56.5s)]
*  The funny thing about this, if you really watch the runner, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=60.5s)]
*  aside from the fact they're going backwards and moving in multiple directions, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=63.0s)]
*  if you watch how they're running, you'll see that their physical body [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=67.5s)]
*  is not matching the way a runner would run. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=70.5s)]
*  In other words, you'll see their arms doing a double take, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=73.0s)]
*  and that means their balance wouldn't work and they wouldn't be able to function. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=76.0s)]
*  These are things that the AI still doesn't understand about the physical world. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=79.0s)]
*  That's Stephen Messer, the co-founder of an AI sales company called Collective Eye. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=82.5s)]
*  He's worked in the AI industry for more than a decade, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=87.5s)]
*  and now he's going to help show us how to spot AI-generated videos. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=90.0s)]
*  Let's consider this clip of a cat waking up its owner. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=94.5s)]
*  Now, you look at this cat video, it's pretty amazing. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=97.5s)]
*  One, really cute cat. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=100.0s)]
*  But you probably noticed that some of the physics, again, are off, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=101.5s)]
*  Where the user switches over and flips over, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=104.5s)]
*  the way the sheet flips over is a little bit weird. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=107.0s)]
*  But if you look really closely and if you use your skill, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=109.5s)]
*  you probably are noticing something's a little bit weird about the cat. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=113.0s)]
*  There's two paws already out, and from the middle of the cat, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=116.0s)]
*  a third paw magically appears. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=118.5s)]
*  These are examples of some of the places where things just are a little bit off. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=120.5s)]
*  Again, always coming down to physics of the real world. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=124.0s)]
*  And when the platform stimulates people, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=127.0s)]
*  sometimes things may not feel quite right, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=129.0s)]
*  like with the cooking grandmother from earlier. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=131.5s)]
*  So our senses are amazing at spotting weird things. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=134.0s)]
*  Things that just don't feel right. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=138.5s)]
*  If you look at the hands and the way our movements work, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=140.5s)]
*  you'll notice that that is not how humans move their fingers or their body. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=143.0s)]
*  And then we have hyper-realistic landscape shots, like this one. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=148.0s)]
*  At first glance, this might look like drone footage of the Amalfi Coast. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=152.0s)]
*  Look at the waves. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=155.5s)]
*  The waves are going out as opposed to in. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=157.0s)]
*  Again, a physics problem that exists. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=160.0s)]
*  And that's not all. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=163.0s)]
*  The same thing with the stairwell. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=164.0s)]
*  You can see stairwells that sort of lead to nothing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=165.5s)]
*  Stairwells that are all over the place. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=168.0s)]
*  Because it was asked for, it's just throwing stairwells, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=170.0s)]
*  not in a way that physics would demand for us to actually use them. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=172.5s)]
*  And so it's probably found in lots of videos, different staircases, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=176.5s)]
*  and it shoved them into the video. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=180.0s)]
*  Sora can simulate historical footage too, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=181.5s)]
*  down to the grainy texture of an old film camera. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=184.0s)]
*  But when you look closer, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=187.0s)]
*  You're going to start to notice that there are houses of all different generations that are there. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=188.5s)]
*  I would also point out that if you notice, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=193.5s)]
*  in every western video you've ever seen, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=196.0s)]
*  they don't have streets where one horse goes one direction, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=198.5s)]
*  and horses then come the other direction, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=201.5s)]
*  which is what you'll see here as if it's like a modern road. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=203.5s)]
*  And here, sadly, one of the horses melts into the ground mid-shot. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=206.5s)]
*  OpenAI acknowledges the tool has some spatial issues, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=210.5s)]
*  like in this scene set in Tokyo. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=214.0s)]
*  If you watch the cars going in the opposite direction, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=216.5s)]
*  when they go through the trees, they disappear. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=218.5s)]
*  Animated scenes can make it more difficult to tell if a video was created by AI. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=220.5s)]
*  Look, animations you don't expect to be perfect. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=225.5s)]
*  In fact, part of the fun sometimes is that they do things that are physically impossible to do. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=228.0s)]
*  Here, the AI tool masters 3D geometry, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=232.5s)]
*  but there are still a few things that feel off. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=235.5s)]
*  His eyes do not reflect the people in front of him, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=238.5s)]
*  which is actually something you would expect to see. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=241.0s)]
*  Fingers move in strange ways, but again, these are characters. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=244.5s)]
*  Wile E. Coyote runs into a wall and runs through a truck. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=248.0s)]
*  So these are probably the areas where you're going to see a lot of usage in the beginning. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=253.0s)]
*  In another clip of a paper coral reef, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=256.5s)]
*  the generative AI shows more of a flair for storytelling and world building. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=258.5s)]
*  Here, what you're seeing is the level of creativity that humanity can have [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=262.5s)]
*  when working with tools like this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=266.5s)]
*  You can come up with almost any idea that nobody would have ever thought of before [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=268.5s)]
*  and have such a high-quality rendering. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=271.5s)]
*  I could see this being a movie that nobody ever thought about before. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=273.5s)]
*  Sora learned to create these types of animated characters from the data it was trained on. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=277.5s)]
*  In this case, licensed and open-source video material. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=282.5s)]
*  But right now, a number of lawsuits against open AI [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=285.5s)]
*  hinge on the question of whether publicly available copyrighted content [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=288.5s)]
*  is fair game for AI training. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=292.0s)]
*  I think mostly what you see is a content-created world [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=294.0s)]
*  seeing a new entity rise up, similar to the way Google did early on, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=297.5s)]
*  where they're making money off the backs of other people's work. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=301.5s)]
*  And I think that's naturally going to lead itself to lawsuits. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=304.5s)]
*  Even though Sora hasn't been publicly released yet, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=307.5s)]
*  some industry experts are already concerned about its potential for misuse. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=311.0s)]
*  Tools like this will be used for powerful misinformation. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=315.0s)]
*  There are bad actors that will look to seek to take advantage of the fact [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=318.0s)]
*  that a lot of people cannot spot these differences. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=322.0s)]
*  Open AI says it's taking actions to get ready for the 2024 presidential election, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=325.0s)]
*  including prohibiting the use of its platforms for political campaigning. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=329.5s)]
*  It's also developing tools that can tell when a video was generated by Sora. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=333.0s)]
*  There are privacy concerns, too. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=337.0s)]
*  If it's been trained on video from the internet, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=339.5s)]
*  that means a lot of people who've been in videos on the internet, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=341.5s)]
*  whether you uploaded your family holiday, etc., [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=344.5s)]
*  could in theory be used as these things progress. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=347.0s)]
*  But when it comes to actual filmmaking, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=351.5s)]
*  experts say it will be a long time before text-to-video threatens the medium. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=353.5s)]
*  Right now, the platform can only create clips that are up to a minute long. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=357.5s)]
*  Because the AI model won't respond to similar prompts in the exact same way, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=361.5s)]
*  you couldn't combine 60 different one-minute AI clips into a coherent movie. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=366.0s)]
*  So all of these models tend to what they call hallucinate. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=371.0s)]
*  They sort of go off the beaten path. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=374.5s)]
*  So the longer the video is, the more likely it is to fall apart. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=376.5s)]
*  But the tool could still transform other short-form content creator platforms. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=380.5s)]
*  If you're someone who's up and coming, and you think to yourself, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=385.0s)]
*  I don't have the cash, I can't get the skill, I don't have these people, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=388.0s)]
*  this becomes unbelievably democratizing to the world [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=391.0s)]
*  and their ability to bring things to market. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=394.5s)]
*  And video creators have something else to get excited about. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=396.5s)]
*  OpenAI says Sora is also able to generate videos from a single image. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=399.5s)]
*  This would seemingly allow people to draw what's on their mind and animate it to life. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=404.5s)]
*  So when you think about that, you realize we're still at the very early stages [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=408.5s)]
*  of pretty powerful changes in the way videos are created. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XllmgXBQUwA&t=412.5s)]
