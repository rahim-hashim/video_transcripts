*  In 2019, this new BMW marked the start of a new production in a car plant in Western [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=0.0s)]
*  Russia. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=6.92s)]
*  Today, it is Chinese cars coming off the assembly line. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=7.92s)]
*  The factory produced tens of thousands of vehicles including Ford trucks, German BMWs [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  and South Korean Hyundai's every year, until Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=19.16s)]
*  As international sanctions prompted foreign automakers to leave the country, Chinese brands [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=24.84s)]
*  filled the void, making billions of dollars. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=29.98s)]
*  Car makers who have been struggling in the domestic market in China, they're finding [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=33.5s)]
*  an opportunistic moment when it comes to the Russian market. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=38.08s)]
*  Here's how Chinese car makers are profiting from the Western corporate exodus and what [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=42.3s)]
*  it means for Russia's auto markets. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=46.68s)]
*  Car making is one of Russia's main industries. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=51.3s)]
*  It employed some 300,000 people directly and produced vehicles and parts worth about [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=54.38s)]
*  $42 billion in 2020. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=59.620000000000005s)]
*  The first Renault created for the Russian market. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=62.540000000000006s)]
*  Foreign automakers opened factories and partnered with local brands, pushing Russia into the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=67.14s)]
*  ranks of the world's top car producers. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=72.54s)]
*  And Russians eagerly embraced foreign cars, with Japanese, Korean and European brands [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=75.66s)]
*  dominating the market for years. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=81.58s)]
*  But Moscow's invasion of Ukraine hit the industry hard. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=85.10000000000001s)]
*  Western sanctions cut off Russia's access to global supply chains for essential parts [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=89.46000000000001s)]
*  such as computer chips, prompting many foreign brands to halt production or withdraw from [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=94.58s)]
*  the country. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=99.94s)]
*  Soaring inflation and uncertainty contributed to a dramatic drop in car sales in the country [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=101.14s)]
*  last year. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=106.94s)]
*  But assembly lines didn't stay idle for long. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=108.9s)]
*  Demand started to pick up as Chinese brands stepped in. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=112.26s)]
*  Car dealerships across Russia started reopening under new brands. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=115.78s)]
*  For example, this showroom outside Moscow changed from Nissan to Ka-Yi from China. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=120.14s)]
*  Russian buyers became more familiar with Chinese cars. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=126.74000000000001s)]
*  Chinese SUVs have even been spotted in the Kremlin's motorcades. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=130.62s)]
*  By mid-2023, the list of the 10 most popular car brands in Russia looked very different [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=135.34s)]
*  to before the war. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=141.14000000000001s)]
*  Six of them were Chinese. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=142.70000000000002s)]
*  This year, Russia became the number one buyer of Chinese vehicles, spending some $6 billion [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=144.66s)]
*  in the first four months of 2023, helping China to become the world's largest auto exporter. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=151.02s)]
*  The exports to Russia have got an outsize importance, especially for the car makers [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=157.7s)]
*  who have struggled to pivot to a successful EV strategy. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=162.3s)]
*  Within China, sales of petroleum-powered vehicles have dropped, so they now have some excess [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=166.14000000000001s)]
*  capacity and Russia presents a good opportunity for these car makers. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=171.98000000000002s)]
*  But Russia's market also poses challenges. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=177.06s)]
*  As Chinese car brands become more mature, I think a lot of them are seriously considering [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=179.98000000000002s)]
*  the prospect of one day becoming the world's biggest auto manufacturer. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=184.9s)]
*  And in the grand scheme of things, Russia may not be a big consideration for them because [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=189.78s)]
*  of the constraints in this market at present. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=196.1s)]
*  Chinese automakers are also not immune to the bad publicity that comes with working [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=199.82s)]
*  in Russia. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=204.06s)]
*  In June, in a symbolic gesture, Ukraine branded Chinese maker Zhili as a sponsor of war for [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=205.14s)]
*  continuing operations in Russia. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=211.86s)]
*  Companies like Zhili have multiple brands and some of these brands are trying to explore [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=214.74s)]
*  the Western European market. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=219.5s)]
*  So if they make a big push in Russia, then it may cause them other problems in terms [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=221.5s)]
*  of political risks because it may not be well regarded in front of Western European consumers. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=227.98s)]
*  Zhili declined to comment on the challenges related to his operations in Russia. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=236.1s)]
*  Russia's after-door plants, which now produce Chinese passenger cars, didn't respond to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=241.38s)]
*  a request for comment. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=245.86s)]
*  These automakers' expansion into the Russian market highlights the ever closer ties between [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=249.06s)]
*  Beijing and Moscow. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=254.58s)]
*  At the moment, the relationship appears to be mutually beneficial. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=256.86s)]
*  However, the question is whether Chinese brands are willing to keep taking the risks associated [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=260.5s)]
*  with Russia and manage the unpredictable nature of doing business there in the long run. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHYQLCe1VE&t=266.1s)]
