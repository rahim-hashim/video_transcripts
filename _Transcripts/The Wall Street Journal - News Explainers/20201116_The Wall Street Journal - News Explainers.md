# How the U.S-China Fight for TikTok Further Fractures the Internet  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM)
*  We generate a lot of data. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=0.0s)]
*  Analysts estimate that the average connected person has a digital interaction every 30 seconds. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=3.74s)]
*  A big chunk of that comes from people like me, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=10.0s)]
*  using all sorts of apps and services throughout the day. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=13.14s)]
*  Whether I walk somewhere, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=15.98s)]
*  write an email, or like a video on social media, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=17.6s)]
*  companies use this information to build digital profiles, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=20.68s)]
*  which are used to do everything from sell ads to analyze photos to train AI, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=24.22s)]
*  personalize stock portfolios, or customize your Netflix feed. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=30.22s)]
*  It's become so valuable that governments are making big moves to protect their citizens' data. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=34.18s)]
*  People already talk about this becoming not the internet, but the splinter net. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=39.980000000000004s)]
*  One famous example? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=44.72s)]
*  TikTok. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=46.34s)]
*  The video sharing app skyrocketed to popularity in the U.S., [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=47.1s)]
*  and later, the U.S. government labeled it a national security threat. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=50.7s)]
*  Would you recommend that people download that app on their phones tonight, tomorrow, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=55.14s)]
*  anytime currently? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=59.26s)]
*  Only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=61.339999999999996s)]
*  To be clear, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=65.1s)]
*  has said it hasn't and wouldn't share data with the Chinese government. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=68.1s)]
*  But I wanted to understand how exactly my data could raise national security concerns. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=72.38s)]
*  Let's start here with my digital profile. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=78.18s)]
*  It's not the profile you'd see on social media, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=82.14s)]
*  but a composite of data collected behind the scenes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=84.34s)]
*  Every time I use my phone, laptop, or even a smart speaker, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=88.34s)]
*  more and more data gets added to the profile. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=91.98s)]
*  I'm not sure the average person fully appreciates the cybersecurity risks they're all under. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=94.54s)]
*  That's Stuart Madnick. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=101.62s)]
*  He's a professor at MIT, and he's been in the cybersecurity world since the late 70s. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=102.94s)]
*  TikTok is only one of many ways that people have of knowing a lot about you. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=108.14s)]
*  We use Google so it knows about our searching. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=112.66s)]
*  We use Facebook and we communicate with our friends. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=115.30000000000001s)]
*  We share all kinds of videos. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=117.9s)]
*  Yes, they're giving their service away for free, but they're gathering the data. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=119.58000000000001s)]
*  Take a hypothetical day in my life. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=123.94000000000001s)]
*  I use a sleep timer on my phone, which sets off an alarm at 7 a.m. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=125.94000000000001s)]
*  From bed, I'll click on a few breaking news alerts from overnight, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=129.98000000000002s)]
*  spend a few minutes scrolling through social media, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=133.02s)]
*  and turn on my smart speaker to listen to a podcast. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=135.22s)]
*  Before I even get in the shower, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=138.42000000000002s)]
*  several apps on my phone have already collected my location, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=140.02s)]
*  private messages, contact list, and IP address, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=143.38s)]
*  which is like a digital address for your computer [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=146.73999999999998s)]
*  that can reveal what part of the world you're in. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=149.1s)]
*  If you grant them permission, these apps can exchange data with each other [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=151.26s)]
*  and potentially store it in several places around the world. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=155.1s)]
*  If I signed up for one app using my login credentials from a social media site, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=158.78s)]
*  the new app might be able to see my list of friends and latest activity on that site. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=162.85999999999999s)]
*  My location and email data can be used to give me personalized ads, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=168.26s)]
*  and my contact list is accessible by a number of different apps on my phone. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=172.78s)]
*  All of this data can paint a pretty clear picture of our lives. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=177.66s)]
*  And with all the apps out there, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=181.46s)]
*  I wanted to know why President Trump is singling out a video sharing app like TikTok. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=183.74s)]
*  I called my colleague Lisa Lin. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=188.46s)]
*  She writes about Chinese technology. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=190.14s)]
*  So TikTok collects a ton of data that, frankly, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=192.3s)]
*  it's not too different from Facebook or Google's YouTube. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=195.18s)]
*  TikTok collects your location data. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=198.7s)]
*  TikTok collects your IP address. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=201.1s)]
*  TikTok collects the type of phone you use to log on. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=203.42s)]
*  And in addition, TikTok also collects everything you do on the app. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=206.46s)]
*  The key difference? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=209.85999999999999s)]
*  ByteDance, the company that created TikTok, is based in China. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=211.1s)]
*  And that makes the Trump administration nervous. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=215.26s)]
*  In the eyes of the Trump administration, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=218.26s)]
*  the data collected by TikTok could be used by the Communist Party [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=220.06s)]
*  to compile dossiers of personal information of millions of Americans. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=223.29999999999998s)]
*  We're looking at TikTok. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=228.01999999999998s)]
*  We may be banning TikTok. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=229.29999999999998s)]
*  Right now, there is no smoking gun that actually proves [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=231.22s)]
*  that TikTok is sharing data with the Chinese government. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=234.85999999999999s)]
*  The Trump administration's assertions are largely based on the assumption [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=238.38s)]
*  that TikTok will have to share data with the Chinese government when asked. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=242.7s)]
*  And this is not unfounded because China has a national security law [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=247.85999999999999s)]
*  that requires companies to cooperate with national security investigations. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=252.54s)]
*  ByteDance has said it operates independently from the Chinese government. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=257.42s)]
*  But one issue is that national security in China [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=260.94s)]
*  can be anything from a terrorism threat to dissenting with the government. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=264.34s)]
*  So the Trump administration asked TikTok to set up a US-based company [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=269.14s)]
*  to operate independently from China. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=273.5s)]
*  It's part of a big strategy shift after many years of interconnected apps [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=276.26s)]
*  and systems for American users. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=280.34s)]
*  We are now evaluating each instance where we believe that US citizens' data [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=283.06s)]
*  that they have on their phones or in their system or in their health care records, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=288.1s)]
*  we want to make sure that the Chinese Communist Party doesn't have a way to easily access that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=292.3s)]
*  That's where the splinternet, or a global fractured internet, comes in. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=296.74s)]
*  A fractured internet was something I had to get used to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=302.14000000000004s)]
*  when I was a correspondent for the journal based out of Shanghai. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  I say that because in China, many of the US applications are not available. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=308.26000000000005s)]
*  For example, Google has had pulled out many years ago, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=312.62s)]
*  Facebook is blocked, Twitter is blocked. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=315.86s)]
*  So that's what a fractured Google internet will look like. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=318.46000000000004s)]
*  It causes some inconvenience, but it just means that you have applications to do different things. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=321.62s)]
*  The splinternet isn't just disrupting the way data moves across borders. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=326.98s)]
*  It's also affecting the way money flows around the world. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=330.90000000000003s)]
*  So up through from about 2000 to the mid-2010s, around 2016, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=334.02000000000004s)]
*  the growth in investment in the US was on a steady upward trend. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=340.02000000000004s)]
*  The last few years have seen a pretty dramatic reversal. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=344.42s)]
*  That's Adam Lisenko. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=347.9s)]
*  He tracks foreign investment from China into the US, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  which has shrunk as the two superpowers clash over everything from trade to advanced technologies. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=352.7s)]
*  We've seen signs that US government has been increasing scrutiny over Chinese investments [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=358.7s)]
*  in US assets that entail substantial data, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=363.78s)]
*  especially where that data covers behaviors or sensitive information connected to US citizens. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=367.5s)]
*  Examples include Grindr, the dating app, Patients Like Me. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=373.74s)]
*  So clearly the writing has been on the wall that regulators are concerned about these data assets. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=378.66s)]
*  There have already been a couple of indications where US attention is likely to go next. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=383.66s)]
*  The executive order targeting WeChat, for example, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=387.94s)]
*  that was released around the same time that scrutiny over TikTok was really ramping up. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=391.14s)]
*  And it's not just China and the US. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=395.74s)]
*  Other countries have been taking control of their internet to varying degrees, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=398.46000000000004s)]
*  like the EU enacting GDPR to protect data privacy. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=402.62s)]
*  User data is becoming a sort of sovereign asset, and countries are moving to protect that. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=407.06s)]
*  So Trump's move obviously has broader implications beyond TikTok. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=412.9s)]
*  Firstly, from a bilateral relationship standpoint, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=417.38s)]
*  you know, this isn't going to help the US-China relationship. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=420.62s)]
*  Chinese companies are watching to see whether or not entering the US market is a worthwhile bet. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=423.58s)]
*  TikTok is the most successful Chinese technology company in the United States ever. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=428.70000000000005s)]
*  And if the message that the United States sends to China is that that sort of success here just isn't welcome, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=434.02000000000004s)]
*  then all technology firms from China are going to be rethinking their future plans [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=441.14000000000004s)]
*  and whether or not they can or should involve the United States. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=446.34000000000003s)]
*  If you sit back and you try to say, what are the basic principles underlying the TikTok concerns? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=449.38s)]
*  And you say, does your business in any way, shape or form have those possible concerns? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=455.02s)]
*  The answer to most businesses would be yes. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=460.65999999999997s)]
*  As governments tighten control over their citizens' data, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=463.09999999999997s)]
*  the way many companies do business could get looked at with fresh scrutiny. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=466.46s)]
*  And that could ultimately affect the way users like me experience the internet, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=470.7s)]
*  as my data and global competition become bound by digital borders. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JT2rtwQXbM&t=475.26s)]
