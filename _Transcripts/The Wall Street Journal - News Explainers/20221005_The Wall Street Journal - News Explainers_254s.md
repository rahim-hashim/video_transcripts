# How Derivatives Ravaged the U.K. Bond Market | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA)
*  This is a graph of U.K. bond yields from the last month. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=0.0s)]
*  After a tumultuous week, the market is starting to settle. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  The government announced Monday that it would walk back part of its controversial tax cut plan, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=7.4s)]
*  a move to cut the top rate of income tax. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=11.88s)]
*  That, in addition to an emergency bond buying program from the Bank of England, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=14.6s)]
*  helped calm investors after the U.K.'s financial market was thrown into chaos last week. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=18.68s)]
*  England's central bank looking to put down a revolt in the financial markets there. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=23.96s)]
*  They did a dramatic intervention today to try to calm the markets following the turmoil after last week's mini budget. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=28.68s)]
*  They worked through the night and came up with an unprecedented package. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=34.76s)]
*  At the heart of the crisis are derivatives, complex financial instruments that allow investors to bet on the performance of assets, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  in this case, government bonds. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=45.68s)]
*  Well, this was a somewhat niche part of the market, but it rippled out in ways that people really didn't expect. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=47.8s)]
*  And in the end, it was potentially going to impact the entire financial stability for the U.K. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=53.72s)]
*  Here's how this type of investment started a ripple effect that risked creating crisis level losses in typically quiet corners of the market. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=59.4s)]
*  Let's look at where the bond crisis started. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=69.0s)]
*  On September 23rd, the British government unveiled sweeping tax cuts as part of a plan to kickstart economic growth. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=71.32s)]
*  High tax rates damage Britain's competitiveness. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=78.52s)]
*  They reduced the incentive to work, to invest and to start a business. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=82.88000000000001s)]
*  The announcement spooked many investors, who responded by starting to sell off their holdings of government bonds. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=87.16s)]
*  They're worried that they were going to flood the market with new issuance at a time when demand for U.K. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  debt is already very low, as well they're concerned that it's going to stoke inflation and make the Bank of England even more aggressive in raising interest rates. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=98.88s)]
*  The sell-off sent yields sharply higher as bond prices fell. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=106.36s)]
*  Bond prices and yields are inversely related. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  But these changes didn't just impact bondholders directly. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=113.16s)]
*  They also affected investors, like pension funds, who held derivatives such as interest rate swaps. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=116.36s)]
*  These are financial contracts whose values are tied to assets like bonds. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=122.36s)]
*  They were doing a lot with borrowed money. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=126.68s)]
*  It's called leverage in the financial world. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=129.08s)]
*  And that means that you can buy hedges or protect against interest rate swings or inflation very cheap. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=131.72s)]
*  But that means also whenever interest rates move like they did in recent days, really unprecedented moves, you're exposed many times over. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=137.64s)]
*  To hedge potential losses, derivatives contracts often also require collateral from investors. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=148.92s)]
*  Usually this is held in the form of cash or securities like bonds, but cash is preferred. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  Contracts often also require additional collateral to be posted if those trades begin to lose money. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=160.2s)]
*  For example, if interest rates move. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=165.76s)]
*  That was the case for some investors who held these derivatives when bond yields started to rise. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=168.0s)]
*  And because changes were happening so quickly, collateral was requested on a tighter timeline than usual. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=173.16s)]
*  Normally you have maybe a week to get that money to your counterparty. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=178.76s)]
*  In this situation, they were asking for it within hours. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=183.76s)]
*  Pension funds that didn't have enough cash on hand to put up for collateral sold off some of their bonds. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=186.96s)]
*  This created a feedback loop. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=192.48s)]
*  Selling more bonds drove down prices even more, which in turn resulted in more calls for collateral, which led to more bonds being sold off. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=194.6s)]
*  Well, I think what this showed is the risks of derivatives and trading with borrowed money, a.k.a. leverage. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  We've seen this before in the financial crisis. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=209.04s)]
*  But this was once again a reminder of how quickly the market can turn around on you and the widespread impacts that can have on financial markets. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=210.84s)]
*  Justifying its intervention, the Bank of England said on Wednesday, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=218.48s)]
*  Were to function in this market to continue or worsen, there would be a material risk to U.K. financial stability. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=221.84s)]
*  The Bank of England will continue to buy bonds through October 14th. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=228.12s)]
*  But effects from the crisis have spilled into other markets. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=231.36s)]
*  So it's not a long term strategy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of questions about what's happened, what's going to happen once they stop buying those bonds. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=236.08s)]
*  I think this is serving as a reminder of the risks that lie ahead as central banks continue with their plans to raise interest rates to combat inflation. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evGCF3VlBeA&t=240.08s)]
