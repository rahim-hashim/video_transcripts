# Israel Has Invaded Gaza Before. Here’s What Happened. | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs)
*  Israel has entered what it calls a new phase of its war against Hamas, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=0.0s)]
*  with a military advance deep into the heart of Gaza. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=6.0s)]
*  Israel has launched ground invasions of Gaza before, most recently in 2009 and 2014. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=11.0s)]
*  But this time, Israeli forces plan to go further in a multi-phased offensive into Gaza's sprawling cities [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=19.0s)]
*  with the aim of destroying the military capabilities of Hamas, a US designated terror group. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=27.0s)]
*  Here's a look at how Israeli ground forces invaded Gaza in 2009 and 2014, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=33.0s)]
*  and what that reveals about Israel's current operation. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=40.0s)]
*  Israeli ground forces' most far-reaching military incursion into Gaza came during Operation Kar Sled in 2009. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=47.0s)]
*  In response to a barrage of Hamas rockets, thousands of Israeli troops entered Gaza from the north and east under the cover of artillery fire. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=56.0s)]
*  The three-week offensive saw extensive street-to-street fighting as Israeli ground forces pushed towards Gaza City [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=68.0s)]
*  with the aim of taking control of rocket launch sites. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=75.0s)]
*  You have to understand the way Gaza is built. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=79.0s)]
*  Yossi Kupavasa is the former head of Israel's military intelligence division. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=82.0s)]
*  Between the populated area and the Israeli territory, there's an open area. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=87.0s)]
*  It's very difficult to move towards the populated area because you're totally exposed. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=92.0s)]
*  As soldiers advanced towards Gaza's major cities, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=100.0s)]
*  they reported finding dozens of buildings booby-trapped with explosives intended to inflict casualties on Israeli troops. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=103.0s)]
*  That's why we prefer to prepare the battlefield by a lot of airstrikes to weaken the enemy [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=111.0s)]
*  so that when we enter their abilities are going to be decimated. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=117.0s)]
*  During the offensive, the IDF remained on the outskirts of Gaza's main cities. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=122.0s)]
*  This kept Israel's casualties low, but limited its ability to target Hamas infrastructure in built-up areas. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=127.0s)]
*  We didn't mean to take over Gaza. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=135.0s)]
*  In 2009, we dealt with the outskirts of some of the main cities, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=137.0s)]
*  but didn't have any intention to actually enter the center of town. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=142.0s)]
*  We didn't put a goal for ourselves, the uprooting of Hamas from Gaza entirely. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=145.0s)]
*  We realized that Hamas is going to stay in place, and that was a mistake, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=150.0s)]
*  because all these rounds were ended with an agreement that enabled Hamas to rearm itself pretty soon. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=154.0s)]
*  By the time the operation ended with Israel's implementation of a unilateral ceasefire, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=159.0s)]
*  1,300 Palestinians and 13 Israelis had been killed. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=164.0s)]
*  A UN fact-finding mission found evidence suggesting both Palestinian armed groups and Israel committed actions [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=169.0s)]
*  amounting to war crimes during the conflict. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=176.0s)]
*  Israel's most recent ground offensive into Gaza was limited in scope due to the lack of resources [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=181.0s)]
*  and limited in scope to destroying aspects of Hamas infrastructure in the enclave. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=188.0s)]
*  In July 2014, Israel launched Operation Protective Edge in response to rockets and mortar fire from Hamas. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=195.0s)]
*  The Israeli government initially launched an aerial operation to destroy a vast network of underground tunnels [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=203.0s)]
*  Hamas had constructed to store weapons, including rockets fired by the group into Israel. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=210.0s)]
*  After Hamas militants used a tunnel to launch a raid on a kibbutz in southern Israel, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=216.0s)]
*  the government's authorized ground troops to cross into Gaza with the aim of destroying cross-border tunnels. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=223.0s)]
*  Every attempt to enter the Gaza Strip underground involves, first of all, anti-tank missiles, mines, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=233.0s)]
*  booby traps that are located in places where you want to enter. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=241.0s)]
*  Israeli troops and armor pushed into Gaza in an effort to locate the entrances to the border tunnels. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=245.0s)]
*  During the seven-week operation, the IDF said it discovered 62 miles of tunnels. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=254.0s)]
*  The problem with tunnels is that you don't see them. It was not easy for us to locate them. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=260.0s)]
*  We had to have a very strong intelligence effort to find out where they are. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=263.0s)]
*  We had to develop a special technique to explode them and make them not function. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=268.0s)]
*  Israel says its troops destroyed 32 tunnels, 14 of which infiltrated into Israeli territory. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=275.0s)]
*  The 2014 conflict ended when troops withdrew from Gaza under a ceasefire agreement reached at the end of August that year. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=283.0s)]
*  The logic at the time was that we inflicted this heavy blow on the infrastructure, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=292.0s)]
*  cost them a lot of operatives and dealing harshly with their rockets launching capabilities. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=296.0s)]
*  To the point that they will ask for a ceasefire under our conditions. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=302.0s)]
*  Sometimes it took longer and sometimes it took a shorter time before they resumed the terror operations, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=305.0s)]
*  but they were always capable of recovering relatively fast. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=312.0s)]
*  The fighting had killed 2,000 Palestinians and 72 Israelis. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=318.0s)]
*  A United Nations panel found evidence indicating war crimes may have been committed [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=324.0s)]
*  by both Israel and Palestinian militant groups during the conflict. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=329.0s)]
*  Israel's previous ground offensives in Gaza were much more limited in scope than what its military is aiming to do now. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=335.0s)]
*  Since Hamas took power in Gaza, Israel hasn't tried to eliminate the group's military infrastructure and leadership in the enclave. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=343.0s)]
*  For many, many years, in any of the previous rounds, we tried not to end up with taking over Gaza. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=352.0s)]
*  But it seems that this time we just cannot afford any other solution. We have to take Gaza. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=358.0s)]
*  A ground invasion with the aim of going into Gaza's cities to destroy Hamas [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=363.0s)]
*  presents one of the biggest challenges the Israeli military has faced in decades. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=368.0s)]
*  This is a dangerous move for any army. It has to be done slowly and carefully and it costs a lot of lives. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctN9vd0RgLs&t=373.0s)]
