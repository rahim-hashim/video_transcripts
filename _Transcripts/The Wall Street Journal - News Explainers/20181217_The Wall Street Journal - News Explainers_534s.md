# How Scammers in China Manipulate Amazon | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [December 17, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY)
*  This was actually one of the first hoverboard factories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=0.0s)]
*  They could produce maybe 15,000 hoverboards a month. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  On Amazon, I pushed them up in the first page. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=10.96s)]
*  Best seller, actually. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=12.8s)]
*  And you've got to remember, not just Amazon US. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=13.8s)]
*  We're talking about Amazon Germany, and we're talking about France, and Italy, and UK. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=16.56s)]
*  Meet Howard Tai, the man who claims credit for turning this anonymous Chinese hoverboard [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=25.16s)]
*  factory into a successful global business. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=30.0s)]
*  I guess that's why they call me the Prince of Amazon, because I teach them how to sell [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=33.52s)]
*  on Amazon. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  His job, manipulate product listings on Amazon to boost his clients' sales. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=40.28s)]
*  How to increase sales, how to do it better. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=45.88s)]
*  How to do it through the gift box, how to do it to increase the flow or data. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=50.84s)]
*  He's one of a number of self-proclaimed experts who are sometimes called the gurus. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=56.12s)]
*  So there's different gurus for different things. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  Most of them, they do have their own traits, their own expertise. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=63.28s)]
*  If you were an Amazon user, you may have noticed that sometimes it's really hard to figure [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=68.56s)]
*  out which products you should buy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=74.0s)]
*  Sometimes they all look the same. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  There are half a billion products all on one site, all vying for your attention. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=79.0s)]
*  And the reality is, the vast majority of buyers would only click somewhere at the very [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=84.34s)]
*  top of the list. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=88.86s)]
*  To get one of those spots, some sellers are ready to do anything. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=90.66s)]
*  Fake reviews, artificial sales, and even bribes, all of which violate Amazon rules. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=95.06s)]
*  Howard Tai has advertised illicit tactics to potential clients and charges thousands [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=102.94s)]
*  of dollars for his consulting. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=107.78s)]
*  But says he does it mainly to defend sellers who have come under attack. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=109.7s)]
*  Did I just get myself in trouble or anything? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=113.58s)]
*  Did I do anything bad yet? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal investigated for months around the world. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=118.38s)]
*  And we came to China's tech and manufacturing hub to know more about the shadowy tactics [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=121.74s)]
*  used by online sellers here to beat their rivals. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=126.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=137.42s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=138.42s)]
*  We found that many sellers choose a radical approach to become one of the first listings [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  you see when you search for a product. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=144.1s)]
*  They take down their competitors. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=146.26s)]
*  Here is our logistics center. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=148.66s)]
*  As you can see, we have here a small assembly line. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=151.85999999999999s)]
*  Amazon entrepreneur Meir Simhi moved from Israel to China 11 years ago. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=156.98s)]
*  He says he has been the target of several attacks. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=161.83999999999997s)]
*  Holiday seasons two years ago, just before Christmas, before Cyber Monday and Black Friday, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=165.22s)]
*  I wake up in the morning one day, I look at my computer and I see zero sales. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=170.38s)]
*  The reason was my main products were suspended. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=177.14s)]
*  If a competitor wants to kill you, you just have to leave a few fake reviews to your product. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=181.94s)]
*  Every day you wake up, the first thing you do is checking your reviews. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=189.22s)]
*  You want to know if you're still in the business or not. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=193.54s)]
*  Insiders say one reason attacks are so common is that they're extremely easy to pull off. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=197.38s)]
*  The manipulators exploit Amazon's automated system. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=203.42s)]
*  Returning a product and flagging it as dangerous or fake can trigger an immediate suspension. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=207.14s)]
*  They will purchase our products and then they will return it, claiming that the product [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=215.42s)]
*  is not as described. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=220.34s)]
*  By returning the product, they will also increase the return rate, which will make Amazon suspend [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=221.7s)]
*  our product page. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=227.33999999999997s)]
*  So then what do you do? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=229.33999999999997s)]
*  Is your product just finished? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=230.33999999999997s)]
*  In some cases, yeah, you cannot come back from this kind of attack. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=232.57999999999998s)]
*  Amazon says it has put in place sophisticated systems to monitor attacks and that genuine [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=237.1s)]
*  sellers are promptly allowed to list again. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=241.66s)]
*  However, Simhi explains it can take weeks to be back online. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=244.45999999999998s)]
*  It's a jungle. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=248.33999999999997s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=249.33999999999997s)]
*  For me, it can cost tens of thousands of US dollars a year. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=251.1s)]
*  Another way sellers are violating Amazon's rules to try to boost their products is by [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=258.46s)]
*  writing fake reviews. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=263.54s)]
*  Because the more positive reviews sellers have, the higher up their products will appear [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=265.78s)]
*  in listings, making customers more likely to buy. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=270.26s)]
*  When you look at the reviews for this product, you can see that it's very popular. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=275.3s)]
*  But there's almost something too perfect about it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=279.3s)]
*  When you dig down and look into the reviews, you realize that while this product is a pair [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=282.42s)]
*  of headphones, the reviews describe a screen protector. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=286.94s)]
*  It looks like a very clumsy piece of manipulation. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=291.42s)]
*  In the case of these headphones, we emailed the seller, but he didn't reply. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=295.86s)]
*  So if you are an average buyer, how can you spot fake reviews from China? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=301.66s)]
*  It's easy, according to Howard. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=306.62s)]
*  He sat down in our studio to explain. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=308.5s)]
*  It's just really about how it sounds like. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=310.54s)]
*  As long as it sounds like it's from natively from the US and it has some kind of slang [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=313.9s)]
*  and doesn't have too much broken English, then it should be a good review. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=319.26s)]
*  Anything short, I would think is really fake. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=324.74s)]
*  It's awesome. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=326.7s)]
*  It kind of sounds pretty fake to me. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=327.7s)]
*  The question is, how do people actually generate thousands of allegedly fake reviews every day? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=329.78s)]
*  During our investigation, we found that specialized websites control thousands of buyer accounts [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=335.74s)]
*  and use these to sell fake reviews to sellers based in China or anywhere else in the world. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=342.02s)]
*  If Amazon discovers that a seller is using illicit tactics, Amazon will ban that account. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=347.62s)]
*  However, many Chinese sellers have multiple selling accounts. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=353.66s)]
*  So if they get banned from one, they'll just switch over to another. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=357.08s)]
*  And if that one gets banned, they'll just make even more. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=360.42s)]
*  On Amazon in general, the more a vendor sells, the higher his ranking. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=365.74s)]
*  So to artificially boost sales, companies have commissioned third parties to buy their products. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=373.06s)]
*  Some professionals told us they even sent empty boxes to random US addresses and claimed [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=379.46000000000004s)]
*  genuine transactions. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=384.90000000000003s)]
*  It's particularly widespread among producers of cheap generic products, like those on sale [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=388.1s)]
*  in this market. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=393.22s)]
*  Here we are at one of Shenzhen's largest wholesale markets. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=394.82s)]
*  I mean, it's just incredible what a range of electronics and how cheap all of this is. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=398.9s)]
*  What we see here is that they're selling tons of generic electronic products. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=404.7s)]
*  They're basically indistinguishable from one to the other. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=407.97999999999996s)]
*  It's your cell phone charger versus another cell phone charger. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=410.91999999999996s)]
*  And because these are all virtually indistinguishable, whoever can corner the market by making sure [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=414.14s)]
*  that their product rises to the top of the listings is going to get all the sales. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=418.97999999999996s)]
*  So that gives sellers a huge incentive to manipulate the market and drive their product to the top. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=423.1s)]
*  And finally, let's talk about corruption, which of course is totally against the rules. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=437.3s)]
*  During the course of our reporting, we discovered that Amazon is investigating certain of its [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=444.18s)]
*  own employees to determine whether they are accepting bribes to give advantages to sellers. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=448.78s)]
*  According to people familiar with or involved in these transactions, sellers pay bribes [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=455.09999999999997s)]
*  ranging from $80 to $2,000 to Amazon employees in China to delete negative reviews, restore [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=460.38s)]
*  banned sellers' accounts, and obtain restricted Amazon data that will help them boost sales. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=467.14s)]
*  So what does Amazon say about all this? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=473.65999999999997s)]
*  They told us they are constantly monitoring the website for suspicious activity, and that [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=477.58s)]
*  users trying to abuse its system make up a tiny fraction of activity on its site. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=481.78s)]
*  Amazon also uses sophisticated technologies like machine learning to combat bad users. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=486.53999999999996s)]
*  They also pursue civil and criminal penalties. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=492.58s)]
*  But people like Mr. Tai say that so long as Amazon will be governed by algorithms and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=497.26s)]
*  artificial intelligence, there will be humans out there to trick the machines. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=502.38s)]
*  You get this kind of problem where automation will lead to a lot of loopholes. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=507.94s)]
*  Because their system right now is very vulnerable, and they don't do enough, and many sellers [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=516.06s)]
*  are getting hurt. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY&t=522.46s)]
