# The $6T Gap Between Trump’s and Biden’s Tax Plans  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [March 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8)
*  President Biden and Donald Trump have very different tax plans they'd like to implement [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=0.0s)]
*  if elected for another term. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=5.36s)]
*  Very different. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=7.62s)]
*  There's a $6 trillion difference, at least between the two sides, if each were to get [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=8.620000000000001s)]
*  its own ideal policies in place. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=14.08s)]
*  With broad tax cuts from 2017 set to expire at the end of next year, Biden and Trump are [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=16.66s)]
*  headed in opposite directions. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=22.52s)]
*  A fair tax code is how we invest things to make this country great. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=24.88s)]
*  We will cut your taxes even further. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=30.08s)]
*  That's what built our economy. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=32.16s)]
*  Here's what's in that $6 trillion chasm and the difficulties with turning those plans [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=34.76s)]
*  into law. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=39.96s)]
*  This is the bill right here and we're very proud of it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=40.959999999999994s)]
*  In December 2017, Trump signed into law the most far-reaching overhaul of the U.S. tax [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=46.4s)]
*  system in decades. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  The legislation included lower individual tax rates ending before January 1, 2026, with [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=54.24s)]
*  a maximum rate of 37 percent, down from the previous 39.6 percent. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  Standard deduction increased. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=66.2s)]
*  Child tax credit doubled. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=68.68s)]
*  And the corporate tax rate was permanently slashed to 21 percent, its lowest point since [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=71.44s)]
*  1939. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=76.6s)]
*  The goal was to try to spur investment, to give businesses more deductions, lower rates, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=77.6s)]
*  lower taxes on their profits so they'd be more incentivized to make profits, to give [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=82.64s)]
*  people more money in their pockets so they would spend more money. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  But the sweeping cuts also drew criticism. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=92.08s)]
*  The president is part of the top 1 percent and the bill is aimed to help the top 1 percent. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=95.08s)]
*  If Congress does nothing, those individual tax cuts will expire at the end of 2025. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=102.11999999999999s)]
*  And the government estimates that the national revenue would follow this line. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=108.12s)]
*  Neither Biden nor Trump wants that to happen. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=113.04s)]
*  Trump's plan would bring in less money than the revenue baseline. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  Biden's plan would collect more. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=121.12s)]
*  The two agree on extending tax cuts for households that make under $400,000 a year. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=123.4s)]
*  But there is a major difference in how they would tax big corporations and people at the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  highest income levels. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=134.4s)]
*  I will make the Trump tax cuts permanent. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=136.8s)]
*  You know, they expire in a year. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=139.68s)]
*  And we will cut your taxes even more than that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=142.0s)]
*  Trump's approach to taxes is to try to lower them. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=145.12s)]
*  Trump and Republicans really believe that low tax rates are incredibly important for [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=148.72s)]
*  the economy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=153.92s)]
*  Extending those tax cuts would cost the government up to $4 trillion over the next decade. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=156.04s)]
*  For example, keeping the reduced rates and wider tax brackets for ordinary income would [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=161.56s)]
*  cost some $2 trillion. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=166.12s)]
*  And the expanded standard deduction would reduce federal revenue by over $900 billion. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  There's been some back and forth among Republicans about exactly how comfortable they are with [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  further increases in the deficit because of tax cuts. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=178.88000000000002s)]
*  In the 2017 law, not everyone got a tax cut. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  There were things that raised money to help offset the changes they made. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=184.44s)]
*  But in general, they weren't trying to keep things deficit neutral. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=188.32000000000002s)]
*  They were willing to increase deficits in order to cut taxes. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=191.96s)]
*  And that's a choice they'll have to make again. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  On the other side of the divide, Biden wants not only to pay for the rate cuts he'd like [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  to keep, but also bring in additional revenue. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=202.48s)]
*  Getting that done would not be easy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  He wants to extend the tax cuts for people making under $400,000. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  So it's a couple trillion dollars, not the full $4 trillion, but a good chunk of that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  to keep those tax cuts going for most people. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=216.64s)]
*  Beyond that, Biden says he'll increase taxes in other areas to bring in more money for [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=219.76s)]
*  the government. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=224.6s)]
*  You want to make a million or millions of bucks, that's great. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  Just pay your fair share in taxes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=229.16s)]
*  Fairness is in the eye of the beholder when it comes to taxes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=232.04s)]
*  His idea is basically that high income people in corporations should pay more and that that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=234.4s)]
*  money should go largely for new programs and for reducing deficit. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=239.12s)]
*  Biden hasn't laid out exactly where all of this money would come from, but he has outlined [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=244.12s)]
*  what would be some key revenue sources, including raising the corporate tax from 21 percent [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=249.12s)]
*  to 28 percent. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  The Treasury estimates that alone would garner some $1.3 trillion for the government over [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=256.64s)]
*  10 years. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  He has also proposed taxes on individuals at the top, like an increased Medicare tax, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=262.76s)]
*  revamping capital income taxes and imposing a 25 percent minimum tax on the super rich. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=268.32s)]
*  That set of changes would raise more than $1.8 trillion. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  Overall, Biden wants to cover the $4 trillion for continued tax cuts and raise taxes by [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=279.0s)]
*  more than $2 trillion on top of that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=284.6s)]
*  But there's a catch. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=287.32s)]
*  A lot of the tax increases that Biden is running on are ones that he ran on in 2020 or has [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=288.96s)]
*  proposed during his first term. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=293.36s)]
*  Democrats controlled the House, the Senate and the White House for 2021 and 2022. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=295.36s)]
*  And very few of the tax increases they wanted got through. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=300.48s)]
*  As we think about the $6 trillion or more gap between the two candidates, so much really [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=305.76s)]
*  depends on the results of the election. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans both want to extend tax cuts for the majority of Americans. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  But even getting that done will be messy. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=317.76s)]
*  There's likely to be one big tax bill in 2025. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=319.96s)]
*  And so even if there's a point of agreement on what happens for the bulk of people, the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=323.0s)]
*  revenue consequences, the distributional consequences, the political consequences are all tied to [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=329.0s)]
*  what happens to corporations and high income people. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=333.76s)]
*  People making under $400,000 should feel somewhat confident that their tax cuts will get extended [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=337.56s)]
*  because both parties want to do it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=343.0s)]
*  But it will be just inextricably linked to what happens broadly with all the pieces of [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  the tax cuts that are contentious. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUtQPa4g-8&t=351.48s)]
