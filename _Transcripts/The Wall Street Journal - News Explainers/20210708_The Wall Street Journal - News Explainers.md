# How the EV Industry Is Trying to Fix Its Charging Bottleneck  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [July 08, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo)
*  When President Biden test drove a new electric vehicle from Ford, he liked what he saw. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=0.0s)]
*  This sucker's quick. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  But the industry has a problem to solve before consumers get on board with EVs. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=8.48s)]
*  Charging. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=13.24s)]
*  Experts say that concerns over charging are holding many drivers back from switching to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=14.76s)]
*  EVs. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=18.48s)]
*  That's sending companies on a race to improve the nation's charging network. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=19.48s)]
*  It takes public fast charging to sell cars. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=24.0s)]
*  People need the confidence to know that they're going to be able to do that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=26.66s)]
*  But building this new fleet of chargers won't be cheap. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=29.76s)]
*  There's very much a chicken or the egg problem because you'll put chargers on the ground, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=32.72s)]
*  but there's just not demand. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=36.28s)]
*  Here's how charging became the EV industry's bottleneck and what some companies are doing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=38.08s)]
*  to try and fix it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=41.96s)]
*  Charging is a surprisingly complex issue for the EV industry. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=46.28s)]
*  One of the main challenges is that in many cases, it takes too long to fill up the battery [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=50.18000000000001s)]
*  of a car. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  The most satisfied EV owners, according to JD Power, are able to charge at home overnight. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=55.92s)]
*  That can be done with the regular plugs in your home, but charging this way can take [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=61.96s)]
*  days to fill up a standard range vehicle. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=66.4s)]
*  The industry calls this level one charging. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=69.4s)]
*  Homeowners can upgrade to a level two charger, but that can cost thousands of dollars to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  install in some cases. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=77.1s)]
*  Then there are drivers who can't charge at home at all, like many who live in apartments [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=80.2s)]
*  and rely on publicly available chargers. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=84.56s)]
*  The research says that this network needs improvement. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  As of 2021, the U.S. has roughly 41,000 of the faster level two stations available to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=91.12s)]
*  the public. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  The Department of Energy says that by 2030, the U.S. will need 600,000 of these machines [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=98.68s)]
*  to meet expected demand. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=104.0s)]
*  Private companies like Revel are stepping in to try and get ahead of these issues by [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  installing even faster level three stations. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=111.1s)]
*  This is Revel's first super hub in Brooklyn, New York. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=115.25999999999999s)]
*  It's stocked with a direct current power station to service level three chargers. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  The industry calls these DC fast chargers. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=124.22s)]
*  Paul Sui, the company's co-founder, says that this site is the largest fast charging [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=128.26s)]
*  depot in the Americas. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=132.88s)]
*  New York City has a major problem, and the problem is charging infrastructure just simply [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=135.1s)]
*  does not exist. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=139.18s)]
*  It is a challenge to find a studio apartment in New York City, let alone a charging site [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=141.24s)]
*  where you're talking about skyscraper levels of power. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=146.02s)]
*  Revel says that its fast charging plugs can provide 100 miles of range in about 20 minutes. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=150.18s)]
*  The company believes that its fast chargers could ease the anxiety of EV ownership for [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=156.62s)]
*  city dwellers who typically have to pay to enter a public parking garage before paying [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=161.10000000000002s)]
*  again for their charge. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=165.9s)]
*  There's no paywall. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=167.82s)]
*  You can access a charger for free, which is very unique in New York City. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=168.98s)]
*  The second thing is it's just a massive site. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  We're talking 25 chargers in one location. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=174.61999999999998s)]
*  It's just a much better user experience. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=177.29999999999998s)]
*  Revel isn't the only company focused on fast charging. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=180.06s)]
*  DC fast stations are the quickest growing segment of the EV charging market. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=182.89999999999998s)]
*  Tesla pioneered this technology in the 2010s with its supercharger network, which has more [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=189.29999999999998s)]
*  than 25,000 stations worldwide. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=193.98s)]
*  The Tesla system doesn't work with hardware from other manufacturers, and that represents [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=197.62s)]
*  another problem with EV charging. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=202.18s)]
*  Many of the systems on the market are incompatible. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=204.46s)]
*  In the US, companies are designing cars that use different types of charging plugs, which [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=208.18s)]
*  is creating problems for people looking to fill up. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=212.22s)]
*  That's fairly different from the customer experience at gas stations. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=216.9s)]
*  In most cases, the nozzle at the pump will fit the car. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=220.74s)]
*  That won't necessarily be the case for EVs. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=224.86s)]
*  The industry is using a standard plug shape for level 1 and level 2 chargers, but there [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=228.42000000000002s)]
*  are three different plug shapes in use on the newer, faster chargers. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=233.22000000000003s)]
*  Experts say that aside from Tesla, companies are moving toward the combined charging system, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=238.82000000000002s)]
*  or CCS. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=243.62s)]
*  But for now, drivers might need to carry dongles to make sure that their car works with the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=245.62s)]
*  charging ports that they can find. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  That's a problem that companies like EVgo want to solve. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=252.74s)]
*  Jonathan Levy, the company's chief commercial officer, says that their technical team is [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=256.5s)]
*  working to make their chargers compatible with all EVs on the market. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=261.08s)]
*  We're currently in a process where we're installing hundreds of integrated Tesla connectors [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=265.46000000000004s)]
*  at EVgo fast chargers around the country, because there are more than half the EVs being [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=269.82s)]
*  sold right now. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=274.18s)]
*  And while other automakers are bringing more models to market and will continue to penetrate, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=275.18s)]
*  Tesla drivers and EVs using Chattemo and EVs using CCS all need access to charging. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=279.62s)]
*  The company plans to have installed 600 Tesla connectors across its fleet by the end of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=286.06s)]
*  2021. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=290.58000000000004s)]
*  But in the race to make these new, compatible, fast charging machines, the costs for companies [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=292.74s)]
*  and consumers are adding up. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=297.78000000000003s)]
*  Industry experts say that building out a bigger and faster fleet of chargers is going to cost [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=300.62s)]
*  a lot of money up front before consumer demand picks up. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  Experts say that an installation of a level two charger could cost tens of thousands of [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=309.26s)]
*  dollars. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=313.09999999999997s)]
*  But costs for the newer DC fast stations could stretch into the millions of dollars. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=314.09999999999997s)]
*  To cover these costs, EVgo partnered with a special purpose acquisition company to quickly [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=320.46s)]
*  raise funds. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  But red tape is slowing down the build out of its fleet. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=326.4s)]
*  Cities and counties have really been hurt a lot on a budget basis across the country, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=329.82s)]
*  especially in COVID. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=333.21999999999997s)]
*  And so if you have a part time permitting authority that can really slow things down. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=334.48s)]
*  When we think about how long it takes to build a fast charging station, it's anywhere [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=338.78s)]
*  from six to 18 months with exceptions on either side of that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=342.64s)]
*  And it could be a lot quicker if we were able to, again, streamline some of this and work [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=346.08s)]
*  on getting the flywheel spinning in this ecosystem. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=350.17999999999995s)]
*  Some lawmakers in Washington believe that the industry needs help. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=353.61999999999995s)]
*  And answer your direct question, we have a deal. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=356.97999999999996s)]
*  A bipartisan group, including the president and many senators, are calling for $7.5 billion [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=359.46s)]
*  to build a network of chargers along highways and in rural areas. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=365.34s)]
*  But even if public funding materializes, the EV charging companies have to navigate other [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=369.7s)]
*  bottlenecks like regulatory approvals, while the development costs pile up. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=373.97999999999996s)]
*  That could leave some EV owners searching for a place to plug in for some time. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONi8ppkYgo&t=379.5s)]
