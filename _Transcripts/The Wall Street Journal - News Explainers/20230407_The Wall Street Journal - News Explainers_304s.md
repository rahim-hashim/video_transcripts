# What a U.S. 'Wrongfully Detained' Designation Does | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [April 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM)
*  A week after Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was detained in Russia, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=0.0s)]
*  accused of espionage while on a reporting trip, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=4.8s)]
*  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made an important statement. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  In my own mind, there's no doubt that he's being wrongfully detained. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=11.92s)]
*  Those two words, wrongfully detained, when officially applied to a U.S. national held abroad, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=16.32s)]
*  rev up the process for securing the person's release. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=21.92s)]
*  Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Emma Tucker told Face the Nation on April 2nd [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=25.2s)]
*  that she hopes the designation will come quickly. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=29.44s)]
*  And once that official recognition comes, things can then move a bit more rapidly. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=31.92s)]
*  With an official determination on Gershkovich's detention pending, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  let's look at the factors the State Department considers to decide if an [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=40.24s)]
*  American has been wrongfully detained, why it matters, and how it could help secure Gershkovich's release. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  According to the State Department, wrongful detention means that someone is being held [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=52.72s)]
*  on discriminatory or arbitrary grounds. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=56.96s)]
*  The United States government does not automatically go to bat for every American citizen who is held [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=59.84s)]
*  overseas. Being designated as wrongfully detained means the United States government [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=65.12s)]
*  believes that you should not be there and that you should be returned. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  Louise Radnowski covered Brittany Greiner's arrest and release in 2022 [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=73.44s)]
*  and reported on her wrongfully detained designation. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=78.32s)]
*  The State Department says this isn't a legal determination. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  Rather, it's an assessment of circumstances. But it still prompts an important process within [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=84.8s)]
*  the U.S. government. Once an individual receives it, the case transfers from Consular Affairs to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=90.16s)]
*  the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, or SPIHA, currently run by Roger [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=95.52s)]
*  D. Carstens. This office is singularly focused on negotiating the release of hostages and Americans [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=102.0s)]
*  wrongfully detained in other countries. SPIHA has the option to start negotiations for a release. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=108.64s)]
*  And can act as an advocate for detainees and their families. The designation also makes more [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=114.72s)]
*  resources available to the U.S. to negotiate a release, including the option to impose special [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=119.92s)]
*  sanctions on the country where the person is being held. Being considered wrongfully detained [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=125.12s)]
*  effectively commits the power of the U.S. government to securing the person's release and return to the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=130.16s)]
*  United States. A number of Americans are detained abroad every year and they're all entitled to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=135.92s)]
*  consular assistance. But in cases where somebody is considered to have been wrongfully detained, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=141.92s)]
*  then their case is handled differently. It's handled by a different part of the State Department. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  The State Department says the assessment to determine if someone is wrongfully detained [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=151.2s)]
*  varies depending on the case. But it always considers a set of 11 criteria determined by [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=155.2s)]
*  a law called the Levinson Act, which was put in place in 2020. Those 11 criteria include factors [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=160.48s)]
*  concerning the individual, like if he or she is being held for being a U.S. national or for [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=166.48s)]
*  exercising freedom of the press. Officials also examine whether the U.S. has evidence of innocence [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  or if the detainment is a move to influence U.S. policy. Other criteria focus on the situation, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=177.83999999999997s)]
*  like if the detainee is being held in inhumane conditions or if the individual has been denied [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=184.32s)]
*  due process. A case doesn't need to meet all of these criteria to receive the determination. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=189.76s)]
*  The State Department doesn't share full details on the process or the details of individual [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=195.52s)]
*  assessments. But a State Department spokesman said 30 to 40 people are currently held with a [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=200.16s)]
*  distinction. There's only so much I can say about the process for determining whether an American is [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=205.36s)]
*  wrongfully detained. It is a deliberative process. One of the hallmarks of wrongful detention cases [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=212.24s)]
*  is concern for secrecy in a sense that negotiating in public is not necessarily helpful in the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=219.76s)]
*  majority of cases. And so a number of details, presumably because they're considered to be [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=228.0s)]
*  sensitive, are not made public or ever made public, but certainly not while conversations are ongoing. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  Some recent detainees who have returned home, like Greiner and Trevor Reed, had received the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=239.6s)]
*  wrongfully detained designation, but it doesn't guarantee release. Paul Whelan, an ex-marine [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=244.72s)]
*  charged with espionage in Russia who has the label, is still being held more than four years [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=251.36s)]
*  after his detention. It's important to remember that being designated wrongfully detained does not [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=257.12s)]
*  magically unlock a cell door in any way. What it does is carry implications for the United States [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=262.96s)]
*  government. Gershkovich would join the U.S.'s list of wrongfully detained nationals if the State [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=269.84s)]
*  Department makes that official determination. The Wall Street Journal and the U.S. government [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  have vehemently denied the allegation by Russia and have demanded the reporter's immediate release. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=280.64s)]
*  Evan was doing what reporters do and what he did very well. He was out there gathering news, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=286.4s)]
*  talking to people, reporting, providing an eyewitness account of what's going on inside Russia. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRSN0q71sjM&t=293.2s)]
