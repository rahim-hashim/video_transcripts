These big wins can also lead to big losses as they are extremely risky investments. Retail traders have played a big role in driving 0DTE trading volumes to record highs.

# 0DTE: Inside the Explosion of Ultra-Risky Options Trading | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY)
*  You can do some crazy stuff with options like 10k to 90k. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=0.0s)]
*  Zero days to expiration options, or zero DTE, have exploded in popularity in the last year. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=4.4s)]
*  They allow investors to bet on stock market moves within the same day, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=10.32s)]
*  which can result in big wins and big losses. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=14.0s)]
*  This is one of the biggest shifts I've seen in markets of the past decade. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=17.2s)]
*  Here's why zero DTE options have taken off, despite being some of the riskiest in the entire market. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=21.44s)]
*  So I got into zero DTE in 2020 during the whole lockdown. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=26.72s)]
*  Drayson Little graduated from college in 2021 and has been trading options full-time for about a year. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=32.08s)]
*  He lives in Las Vegas, so his day typically starts around 5.30am, an hour before the market opens on the East Coast. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=38.32s)]
*  First things first is I'll head over to Twitter. That's where I get all my news. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=45.28s)]
*  On big news days, like when inflation data is released, he says it's easier to spot a trend in the market. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=50.08s)]
*  You can see a massive move into and from that PCE number. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=55.6s)]
*  Which he says is the best time to trade zero DTE. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=59.28s)]
*  In one minute, I had made $100. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  He says he usually bets a few thousand dollars per trade. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  One of his biggest one-day profits was about $14,000, and biggest loss was about $12,000. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  It's like euphoria. It's like winning a lottery. But then you also have your crazy lows. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=74.4s)]
*  Zero DTE options expire the same day they're purchased, which is why... [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=79.2s)]
*  They are some of the most sensitive to changes in the stock's price. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=83.52s)]
*  So that's why you can see them zip higher or crash incredibly quickly. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=88.0s)]
*  But that's also part of the reason they're so appealing to traders. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=92.8s)]
*  Your upside potential is infinite. It can be 500 percent, it can be 1,000 percent. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=96.08s)]
*  Traders are also drawn to zero DTE options because they're cheaper than longer-dated contracts. But... [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=100.56s)]
*  Often the odds are stacked against you. A lot of these retail traders do end up losing a lot of money. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=106.64s)]
*  Drayson says some of his biggest losses occurred in his first year of trading. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=112.56s)]
*  I think I probably lost at the time during 2020 upwards of like $65,000. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  And this was when I was a full-time student. I was an entrepreneur before. I had made some money from [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=124.16s)]
*  e-commerce. I lost 20, 30 percent of it. And it just feels really bad, to be honest with you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  But he says the possibility of big wins enticed him to keep trading. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=137.28s)]
*  The thing is with a nine to five, it's not scalable. You only make so much during these hours [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=141.28s)]
*  compared to trading where you take one crazy trade, like just one trade, and you make a million dollars. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=147.6s)]
*  This type of options trading has long been reserved for professionals with sophisticated [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  technology and tools. But in the last few years, retail traders have played a big role in driving [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=158.56s)]
*  zero DTE trading volumes to record highs. It's really become a viral phenomenon. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=164.0s)]
*  You know, when I was looking at hashtags for zero DTE online, there are tens of thousands of mentions [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  of zero DTE just this year alone. A few years ago, there were no such mentions. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  Part of the reason is that options exchanges expanded zero DTE contracts to every day of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=180.96s)]
*  the week last year to capitalize on this boom. And that just unleashed a frenzy of activity. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=186.0s)]
*  And traders I was talking to were saying, we've never seen something [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=192.4s)]
*  take off the way zero DTE trading has. Many of these retail traders started with meme stocks. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=196.0s)]
*  This is really the continuation of a trend the past few years as more people have entered markets [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  where they want to bet on sports, they want to bet at the casino, and they also want to bet on stocks. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  But some experts think all this betting could mean trouble for the market. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=211.76s)]
*  There's a lot of concern from a lot of industry analysts and pundits that suggest that zero DTE [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  could kind of bring about an end of day scenario in markets. That's because when [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=221.27999999999997s)]
*  professional traders buy or sell options, they also buy or sell stocks to hedge their positions. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=225.04s)]
*  That creates worries that if there is a big move in the market, and all of a sudden someone's doing [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  a ton of buying and selling of options that could ripple over into the stock market. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=236.88s)]
*  For example, during the meme stock mania, there were concerns that options activity was exacerbating [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  the volatility. I think a lot of the fear now is that zero DTE volumes will put the market [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=248.0s)]
*  in the same position. The odds of that happening is a lot lower than in a situation [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=254.32s)]
*  like GameStop or meme mania. While this concern is hotly debated on Wall Street, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=258.4s)]
*  Kochuba says zero DTE options have become such a large part of trading that when there's an [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=263.2s)]
*  unexplainable move in the market, you can look at the zero DTE volumes and movement in zero DTE [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=268.32s)]
*  and understand that this could be driving those strange behaviors. I wouldn't regret anything. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=273.92s)]
*  I honestly find it. It has taught me a lot more things and has leveled me up as a person [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=278.96s)]
*  rather than pull me down. With the money he made from trading, he says he was able to buy [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=286.0s)]
*  one of my dream cars, the AMG GTR, get back to my family, travel around the world, and then I bought [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  a Rolex. So that was pretty cool. He says his goal for next year is to make six figures every month [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=297.12s)]
*  and launch an options trading course. You're going to have your lows, you're going to have your highs, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=303.67999999999995s)]
*  but as long as you just keep moving forward, you'll eventually get to your end goal. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5atTocDOTpY&t=308.0s)]
