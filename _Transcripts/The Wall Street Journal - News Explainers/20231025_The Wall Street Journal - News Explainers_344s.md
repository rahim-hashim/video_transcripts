Video Description: Israel is gearing up for a possible ground offensive of Gaza. Underneath the Palestinian enclave sits a labyrinth of tunnels used by Hamas as a key military asset. These tunnels were used by Hamas militants in Israel’s seven-week war on Gaza in 2014 allowing for Hamas to hide weapons, equipment and troops. 

WSJ’s Rory Jones – who visited them in 2014 – explains how they pose a unique challenge to Israel and could make urban combat costly for both Israeli soldiers and Palestinian civilians.

# Why the Maze of Tunnels Under Gaza Is Key to the Israel-Hamas War | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [October 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk)
*  The Gaza Strip is a densely populated area with more than 2 million residents, stretching [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=0.0s)]
*  for 25 miles between Israel and Egypt. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=6.4s)]
*  But just underneath this sprawling landscape, another layer exists, a vast labyrinth of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=10.44s)]
*  tunnels. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=16.16s)]
*  The underground maze was largely built by Hamas. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=17.84s)]
*  The group designated by the US as a terrorist organization controls the Palestinian enclave. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=21.12s)]
*  As Israel prepares for a potential ground offensive in the territory following a broad [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=27.64s)]
*  assault by Hamas on October 7, the subterranean network could play a key role. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  So here's why experts say these tunnels could make urban combat costly for both Israeli [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=38.16s)]
*  soldiers and Palestinian civilians. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=43.72s)]
*  The underground network has existed for decades inside Gaza. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=48.72s)]
*  Previously it was largely used as a route to smuggle goods and weapons from Egypt into [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=53.68s)]
*  the narrowest strip of land that's twice the size of Washington DC. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=59.36s)]
*  But since then, the tunnels have evolved to become a key military asset for Hamas. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  I went in 2014 with the IDF into a Hamas-built tunnel during the conflict at that time. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=69.36s)]
*  It was a pretty crazy experience in a sense. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=78.36s)]
*  These were pretty sophisticated tunnels. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=80.56s)]
*  I'm about six foot and they were, you know, I didn't have to bend down at all in them. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=83.52s)]
*  They were very well reinforced with concrete. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  There was communications lines running down the side of them. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  And then they also had like almost like a sort of little rails or like a sort of railway [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  line running along the length of the tunnel. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  During Israel's seven-week war on Gaza in 2014, the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, said [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=105.44s)]
*  it destroyed 32 tunnels. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=111.8s)]
*  They were used to hide weapons, equipment and troops, but also allowed Hamas militants [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=116.84s)]
*  to launch surprise attacks using cross-border underground networks. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=122.4s)]
*  In the years since then, Hamas has continued to develop its tunnel infrastructure and Israel [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=127.9s)]
*  has continued to target it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=133.68s)]
*  This map, based on a graphic shared by the IDF, represents networks of tunnels that Israel [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=137.12s)]
*  said it damaged. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=142.72s)]
*  I think the expectation is that there is still a significant subterranean network that Israel [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=146.04s)]
*  is going to encounter if and when it goes into Gaza this time. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=153.24s)]
*  Former Israeli security official say Hamas has built hundreds of miles of underground [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  tunnels in the last year or more. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=162.76s)]
*  Israel is readying for a possible ground invasion of Gaza by carrying out airstrikes targeting [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=166.44s)]
*  the subterranean network. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=172.2s)]
*  I think that the Israeli strategy will be to try to destroy as much of the tunnel network [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=174.48s)]
*  as possible before they launch a ground invasion. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=180.44s)]
*  However, the operation to destroy them could be challenging for Israeli forces. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=183.6s)]
*  One of the biggest issues is locating them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=189.36s)]
*  Gaza is a dense urban environment and being able to discern precisely where a continuous [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  tunnel which may in fact be deep underground is located as opposed to possibly natural [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=200.96s)]
*  pockets of slightly differing geology or a host of other aspects of the built up environment. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=209.56s)]
*  It's a really hard challenge. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=218.2s)]
*  Even if a tunnel is located, additional factors including its depth can mean precision bombs [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=220.64s)]
*  can struggle to destroy it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=226.76s)]
*  It depends not only on knowing precisely where the tunnel is beneath the surface but on having [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=228.76s)]
*  the explosive power to be able to damage a tunnel network that's beneath perhaps layers [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=235.0s)]
*  of concrete, possibly layers of metal, whatever the built up environment entails inherently [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=243.76s)]
*  as well as whatever materials have gone into construction of the tunnel itself. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  And the net result is that tunnels are relatively invulnerable in many cases to air attack. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  Analysts say any Israeli operation to destroy the Gaza tunnel system could be complicated [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=265.48s)]
*  by the presence of hostages. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=270.64s)]
*  Our master's armed wing said in a statement on Telegram that some of them were being held [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=273.6s)]
*  in the underground tunnels. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=278.24s)]
*  The aim is to rescue hostages. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  They can't be detonating explosives within the tunnel complex which might kill everyone [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  inside. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=288.88s)]
*  It's going to require ground forces, specifically tunneling forces who know how to operate in [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=289.88s)]
*  these tight spaces, who have trained extensively in how to minimise the risk of ambushes and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=296.2s)]
*  how to avoid triggering various booby traps. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=304.36s)]
*  One 85-year-old hostage who was released by Hamas said she had been inside. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=309.24s)]
*  There are a huge network of tunnels underneath. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=315.28s)]
*  It looks like a spider web. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=322.28s)]
*  Entrances to the subterranean passageways can also be hidden within residential infrastructure. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=324.6s)]
*  Experts say as the war continues, any mission to target the tunnels also brings risks to [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=330.88s)]
*  civilians. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2H9IbvthHk&t=336.64000000000004s)]
