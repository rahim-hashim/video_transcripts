# The FAA and Boeing’s Close Relationship Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [May 09, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k)
*  The one thing that wasn't expected happened. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. airlines are closely following the investigation into the crash of a passenger jet off Indonesia today. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=2.52s)]
*  The plane was a new Boeing 737 MAX. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=8.72s)]
*  Out of millions of things they tested for, we unfortunately found one that wasn't. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Breaking news out of Ethiopia, where a plane went down just outside the capital, killing everyone on board. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=16.84s)]
*  The Boeing 737 MAX 8 is the same model involved in the Indonesian Lion Air jet crash in October. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=23.6s)]
*  No aircraft manufacturer gets a free disaster or two disasters when these crashes are preventable [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=29.48s)]
*  by long established aerodynamic engineering standards. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=35.88s)]
*  The crisis surrounding the crashes of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes in Ethiopia and Indonesia [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  has seized the world's attention and done something perhaps even more remarkable. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=56.88s)]
*  Unite Congress. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=61.0s)]
*  Do you think the FAA has the responsibility to tell these airlines that they cannot change safety for profits? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=62.2s)]
*  As a passenger, I would certainly find it troubling if the captain is describing the training manual as, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=70.72s)]
*  quote, inadequate and almost criminally insufficient. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=76.16s)]
*  This is a recent congressional hearing during which senators from both parties grilled this man, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  Dan Elwell, the acting Federal Aviation Administration chief about the recent Boeing crashes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=84.76s)]
*  Safety is at the core of the FAA's mission. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=91.2s)]
*  It is our first priority. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=94.68s)]
*  Elwell testified about a wide range of issues, but the most serious questions concern the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=96.24s)]
*  FAA's relationship with the industry it regulates. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=100.8s)]
*  I suppose that there's always a question of why we would have a private company certify their product. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=103.72s)]
*  And that's something many Americans might not know or appreciate. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=111.08s)]
*  The federal agency in charge of making sure new planes are safe doesn't actually do those inspections anymore. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=114.48s)]
*  Instead, it outsources certifications to the plane manufacturers themselves. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=120.28s)]
*  The U.S. government is not arm's length with these manufacturers. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=124.92s)]
*  There's too much delegation of public responsibility for airline travel safety. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=129.84s)]
*  You might recognize this man. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=136.32s)]
*  Ralph Nader is a former Green Party presidential candidate and prominent consumer advocate. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=138.4s)]
*  Nader is why we have seat belts in airbags and cars. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=143.92s)]
*  He's also been sounding the alarm about what he sees as the cozy relationship between the FAA [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=147.11999999999998s)]
*  and aircraft manufacturers like Boeing for years. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=152.88s)]
*  He even wrote a book about it in 1994. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  It's a captive agency. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=158.88s)]
*  It's captive by the airline industry and the aircraft manufacturers who swarm over it, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  who get their executives appointed as officials of the FAA. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=165.39999999999998s)]
*  So this book is designed to encourage an attitude of prevention, of foreseeing for stalling. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=169.12s)]
*  Why wait for the crashes to occur? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=174.96s)]
*  Recently, the issue became more personal for Nader. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=178.68s)]
*  His grand-niece, Samia Rose Stumo, was killed in the 737 Max crash in Ethiopia. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=181.36s)]
*  She was only 24, but in her short life she had an advanced degree in global health. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=186.96s)]
*  We'll never know how many lives she would have saved in a 50-year career. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=193.4s)]
*  You can trace the roots of the modern FAA back to a major change the agency instituted in 2005. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=200.12s)]
*  Back then, the Bush administration loosened regulations to allow manufacturers to use [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=208.08s)]
*  their own employees to certify the safety of their planes. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=212.84s)]
*  This was part of a cost-cutting initiative dubbed ODA, or the Organization Designation [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=217.08s)]
*  Authorization Program. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=222.12s)]
*  This cushy relationship between the FAA and Boeing has got to end, and that Congress has [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=224.68s)]
*  got to stand up and provide adequate budgets and adequate technical staff to do their job. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  In a statement, the FAA said the agency has never allowed companies to police themselves [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=235.24s)]
*  or self-certify their aircraft. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=240.08s)]
*  Before the ODA came into effect, the FAA would choose its own inspectors. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=242.56s)]
*  Some of those inspectors may have worked for the manufacturer, but they were chosen and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  supervised by the FAA. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=250.88s)]
*  Today, under the ODA system, Boeing employees certify the safety of Boeing's own planes. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=253.16s)]
*  For Nader and the agency's critics, this is a clear conflict of interest. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  But for the FAA's defenders, these concerns are overblown. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  In the certification process, the FAA is involved from start to finish. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=267.52s)]
*  If you went out to Boeing or Airbus or anywhere where aircraft certification was underway, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=271.76s)]
*  you would find FAA pilots, engineers, all part of the process, working shoulder to shoulder. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't think you could operate the airline industry or the commercial aircraft industry [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=282.6s)]
*  without it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  And that's something both sides can agree on. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  Today, the FAA simply cannot do all of these inspections because it doesn't have the manpower [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=289.44s)]
*  or the resources. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  If we had no ODA, it would require roughly 10,000 more employees and about $1.8 billion [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  for our certification office in the FAA. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=305.56s)]
*  This would be a major increase from the FAA's 2019 budget of $239 million and 1,300 staff. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=308.9s)]
*  It would also represent a significant change to the agency's marching orders, considering [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=316.41999999999996s)]
*  that for the past 15 years, Congress has asked the FAA to tighten its belt and deregulate. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=321.21999999999997s)]
*  Every decade or so, this catches the attention of folks who aren't in the aviation business. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=326.73999999999995s)]
*  Congress, the press, your cranky uncle, they scratch their heads. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=333.06s)]
*  What do you mean the government is working with the airlines? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=338.98s)]
*  Aren't they supposed to be regulating those guys? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=342.26s)]
*  This is a speech that Elwell gave last year to an industry lobbying group. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=344.66s)]
*  I get it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=349.34000000000003s)]
*  I get that thinking, that thought process. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=350.9s)]
*  But the relationship that exists between the FAA, ALPA, and the rest of the industry that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  we regulate is the driving force behind our unprecedented safety record. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=360.86s)]
*  And that is perhaps the FAA's best defense. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=367.72s)]
*  Despite these recent crashes, modern air safety for large transport aircraft in America is [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=370.3s)]
*  better than ever. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=375.1s)]
*  Since 1997, the risk of a fatal commercial aviation accident in the United States has [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=376.3s)]
*  been cut by 94%. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=381.58000000000004s)]
*  And in the past 10 years, we've experienced one commercial airline passenger fatality [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=384.7s)]
*  in the United States in over 90 million flights. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=391.34s)]
*  That's a remarkable record. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=396.62s)]
*  So then what happened with these two flights? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=398.14s)]
*  Since both investigations are still ongoing, it's too early to say. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=400.65999999999997s)]
*  But former FAA head Babbitt thinks the answer is an uncomfortable one. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=404.58s)]
*  I'm not trying to be defensive of the FAA, but I would imagine there are probably more [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=408.38s)]
*  than 100,000 tests were done on this aircraft. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=412.97999999999996s)]
*  And to have a shortcoming in one, that's one shortcoming, too many. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=417.7s)]
*  But out of the mass of literally millions of permutations of what could happen, you [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=421.7s)]
*  know, with the old line, every now and then the holes in the Swiss cheese line up. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=427.26s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=432.17999999999995s)]
*  But the agency's critics see things very differently. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=434.17999999999995s)]
*  For them, the two recent crashes are further proof that deregulation has gotten out of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=439.26s)]
*  control and that industry has effectively taken over the FAA. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=443.65999999999997s)]
*  For Nader, a case in point is the man at the top, Dan Elwell. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=448.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, Elwell is part of the industry FAA turnstile. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=451.46s)]
*  They go in, they go out. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=455.06s)]
*  The current acting FAA head has spent his career bouncing between government and industry. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=457.34s)]
*  Fortunately, he's on his way out and is going to be a new FAA commissioner. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=462.7s)]
*  The problem is he's from Delta. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=467.22s)]
*  So here we go again. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=469.5s)]
*  Boeing is determined to salvage the 737 MAX 8, which is the fastest selling plane in the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=470.98s)]
*  company's history. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=475.7s)]
*  To that end, they are working on a software fix that they hope will get the MAX 8s back [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=477.3s)]
*  in the air flying again this summer. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=481.46000000000004s)]
*  But the growing public scrutiny of the manufacturer could undermine that deadline and perhaps even [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=483.58s)]
*  Boeing's influence within the FAA. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=488.66s)]
*  A recent Wall Street Journal investigation found that Boeing didn't share information [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=491.34000000000003s)]
*  about a problem with a cockpit safety alert system for about a year before the first MAX [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=495.24s)]
*  crash in Indonesia. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=500.2s)]
*  That left not only the flying public in the dark, but also the FAA. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=502.24s)]
*  It was only after the second accident in Ethiopia, nearly five months later, that Boeing became [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=506.44s)]
*  more forthcoming about the problem. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=511.64s)]
*  Boeing said it operates in full accordance with all Federal Aviation Administration oversight [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=515.52s)]
*  requirements and processes. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=519.96s)]
*  The long-standing collaborative engagement between the FAA, Boeing, its customers and [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=521.96s)]
*  industry partners has created the safest transportation system in the world. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifT9MBZm0k&t=526.88s)]
