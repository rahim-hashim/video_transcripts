# A Forced TikTok Sale? How the Company Could Become U.S.-Owned  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4)
*  TikTok is at a crossroads. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=0.0s)]
*  Concerns about its Chinese ownership have been building since 2020. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=3.0s)]
*  TikTok's been in this limbo for two years and who knows how many more months or years it could stay in this limbo. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  And a panel of U.S. officials is torn on how to address them. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=12.24s)]
*  If they can't come to an agreement, there's another possible solution, forcing TikTok to become a U.S. company. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=16.2s)]
*  Here's what it would take to make that happen and why that move poses some big challenges. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=22.84s)]
*  First, a brief review of how TikTok's data is managed, which is the main focus for U.S. officials. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=28.8s)]
*  TikTok's a huge company, but it's owned by a Chinese parent company called ByteDance. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=34.72s)]
*  They run several apps, but TikTok's probably the best known one in the world. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=39.2s)]
*  ByteDance itself is headquartered in Beijing and is owned by investors from around the globe. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=42.96s)]
*  A Chinese state-controlled entity owns one percent of a Beijing-based subsidiary of ByteDance. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Those connections are what some are worried about and for a couple of reasons. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=54.16s)]
*  The first concern is that the Chinese government could order TikTok to hand over data about individual American users. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=58.44s)]
*  So what kind of videos they watch and maybe even their IP addresses, which could identify their location. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=65.16s)]
*  The second big thing is the video recommendation algorithm. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=72.2s)]
*  And the idea is that the Chinese government could order TikTok to control what videos Americans could watch. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=75.88s)]
*  TikTok says it has already started to address some of those concerns. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=82.68s)]
*  The company recently said that all U.S. user traffic is now being routed through cloud servers operated by the U.S.-based company Oracle. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=86.48s)]
*  And TikTok says that only members of its U.S. data security team have access to that data. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=94.2s)]
*  But backups are still being saved to other non-Oracle servers in the U.S. and Singapore, the company says. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=99.52s)]
*  But it's phasing those out. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=104.6s)]
*  As for TikTok's recommendation algorithm, that was created by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=106.16s)]
*  TikTok says changes to the algorithm are monitored by Oracle before they're implemented in the U.S. app. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=111.44s)]
*  So any time there's a change to the algorithm that influences what kind of videos Americans see, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  they say that Oracle will have full access to see what the algorithm does. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=121.4s)]
*  A spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a press conference in November in regards to TikTok that spreading disinformation [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  and then using it to hobble Chinese companies has become a go-to tool for the U.S. government. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=133.48s)]
*  But some U.S. lawmakers still want TikTok to have more separation from China. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=138.72s)]
*  One option is a divestiture order or a forced sale, which could cut ties to Chinese ownership. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=143.6s)]
*  The Chinese government would theoretically have less power over TikTok to force TikTok to do something like spy or control what videos Americans watch. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=149.04s)]
*  A divestiture order is what happened to the dating app Grinder in 2019, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=158.32s)]
*  after U.S. officials determined that the app's personal data could potentially be exploited for blackmail [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=162.52s)]
*  since the majority stakeholder was a Chinese company. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=167.88s)]
*  Here's how the process has worked in past cases. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=170.72s)]
*  First, an executive body branch called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=173.88s)]
*  opens a case with the involved companies. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=180.72s)]
*  This is the panel that's been talking to TikTok. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=182.96s)]
*  It's made up of representatives of nine U.S. departments and agencies, led by the Treasury, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=185.52s)]
*  and reviews foreign transactions to see if they might be a national security risk. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=191.0s)]
*  After CFIUS reviews a company or merger, it can make recommendations to mitigate those risks, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=195.92s)]
*  which can include asking foreign investors or owners to sell their stake in the company. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=200.96s)]
*  In extreme cases, it can also escalate the case to the president, who can order a forced sale. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=205.64s)]
*  That owner then has to find a suitable buyer, usually one within the U.S. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=211.28s)]
*  Then the buyer and seller might have to go back to CFIUS in order to get the sale approved. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=215.96s)]
*  Grindr took just over a year after the order was made to find a buyer and get approval. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=221.0s)]
*  The president never issued an order. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=225.92s)]
*  But TikTok is a much bigger name, and forcing a sale could be more complicated. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=228.32s)]
*  There's been nothing of this scale, this popularity. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=232.84s)]
*  Usually, you know, CFIUS deals with a lot smaller cases here. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=235.24s)]
*  So this is like the case of the century for CFIUS lawyers in Washington, D.C. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=238.32s)]
*  A Treasury official said that CFIUS does not publicly comment on transactions that it may or may not be reviewing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=243.96s)]
*  Officials are worried about a number of challenges facing a forced sale. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=250.28s)]
*  One is that the Trump administration already tried it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=254.2s)]
*  They have until September 15 to make a deal. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=256.88s)]
*  After that, we close it up in this country. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=259.16s)]
*  In 2020, that administration issued an order that would have effectively banned TikTok [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=261.8s)]
*  unless it sold itself to a U.S. buyer. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=266.64s)]
*  But TikTok pushed back and took the order to a federal appeals court, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=269.24s)]
*  arguing that the deal denied the company due process. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=273.28s)]
*  It was still tied up in legal issues by the time Joe Biden got into office. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=276.44s)]
*  And the order was shelved as his administration conducted its own security review. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=280.08s)]
*  But his administration could face similar pushback from TikTok if it tries to force a sale. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=284.68s)]
*  And doing so could risk diluting CFIUS's authority. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  There are powers based on having these vague, broad powers. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  And if they go to court, even if they win in court, a court might put parameters on that power, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  might define that power, because the more vague your power is, the more powerful it is. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=301.08s)]
*  Even without legal hurdles, a sale would also need cooperation from the Chinese government, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=305.52000000000004s)]
*  which has the power to restrict the exports of technology, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=310.16s)]
*  such as TikTok's video recommendation algorithm. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=313.20000000000005s)]
*  If China does not allow the algorithm to be sold, then can TikTok continue operating in the U.S.? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=316.04s)]
*  We don't know. We're in totally uncharted waters right now. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=321.8s)]
*  While CFIUS decides what to do, some lawmakers have taken concerns into their own hands. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  TikTok has been banned on government devices in a majority of states. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  And in December, the federal government implemented a similar ban. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=334.12s)]
*  The only sensible next step is for this Congress to act to make that ban across the board for all federal devices. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=337.56s)]
*  At least one bill has been introduced to ban TikTok entirely in the United States. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  That has legal problems, too. That could potentially face a First Amendment problem. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=351.4s)]
*  Can you can you actually stop? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=356.44s)]
*  Can you actually ban TikTok from operating in the U.S., especially when it has more than 100 million American users? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=358.2s)]
*  While TikTok has made concessions, including how its data is managed, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=364.56s)]
*  to get to an agreement with CFIUS, talks are ongoing, without a clear deadline. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFI6Bg-zmv4&t=368.2s)]
