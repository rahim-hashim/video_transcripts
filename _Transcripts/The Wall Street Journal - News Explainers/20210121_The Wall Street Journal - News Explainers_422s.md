# How China’s Trade Battles Are Hurting Australian Wine | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 21, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY)
*  This is some of the stock that we've got for the Chinese market. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=0.0s)]
*  Mitchell-Taylor's Winery has been selling Australian wine since the 1960s. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=7.0s)]
*  It retails for approximately $1,000 a bottle. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=11.84s)]
*  And in the past five years, China has been his main focus. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=15.64s)]
*  That's the back label there with all the Chinese details. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=19.28s)]
*  But these bottles could now be three times as expensive, because China has imposed new [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=22.84s)]
*  tariffs of up to 212% on Australian wine. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=27.12s)]
*  I was absolutely shocked. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=30.8s)]
*  It really did hit me hard. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=32.52s)]
*  Since May, Australia has been caught in a trade dispute with China. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=35.04s)]
*  It has hit not just the wine industry, but also coal, barley, lobster and beef. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Some economists say as much as 6% of Australia's GDP hangs in the balance. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=43.8s)]
*  It's an attack on free countries everywhere. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=49.84s)]
*  The bilateral trade dispute has gone global. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=52.96s)]
*  China hawks and lawmakers from across the political spectrum and around the world are [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=55.559999999999995s)]
*  taking Australia's side. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=59.8s)]
*  The White House National Security Council even tweeted that it would serve Australian [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=61.76s)]
*  wine at its holiday reception. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=65.56s)]
*  Politicians are jumping on China's wine tariff to draw global attention to what they [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=68.2s)]
*  see as Beijing's bullying. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=72.2s)]
*  And Australia's winemakers hope this new coalition can help save their industry. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=74.32s)]
*  It's a great initiative. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=78.96s)]
*  The coalition of partners can come together and help us all put pressure on the Chinese [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=80.0s)]
*  regime. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=86.64s)]
*  The virus began in China, in Wuhan. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=89.8s)]
*  That's, I think, well understood. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=92.2s)]
*  This statement is what sparked the dispute when back in April, the Australian government [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=94.36s)]
*  called for an investigation into the origin of the coronavirus pandemic. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=98.48s)]
*  Beijing, which has suggested that the virus came from outside China, dispelled the criticism. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=102.6s)]
*  This so-called independent investigation is actually trying to manipulate politics and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=110.0s)]
*  interfere with international epidemic prevention and control cooperation. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=114.36s)]
*  It's inhumane. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=116.56s)]
*  But this diplomatic tussle is about more than the virus. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=117.56s)]
*  China has pointed out several grievances against Australia, like when it banned Chinese telecom [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=121.04s)]
*  firm Huawei from its 5G network because it said it posed a national security threat, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=125.76s)]
*  even though Huawei said it has operated safely in the country. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=130.64s)]
*  And when Australia condemned China's controversial national security law in Hong Kong, which [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=135.8s)]
*  Beijing said is a domestic matter. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=140.24s)]
*  So in May, China slapped tariffs of up to 80 percent on barley, followed by levies on [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=143.16000000000003s)]
*  other goods. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  Timber exports were also stopped at Chinese customs. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=149.0s)]
*  For entrepreneurs like Mitchell Taylor, these tensions threaten their businesses, as they've [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=153.68s)]
*  bet big on China and invested to expand production by buying new land and upgrading facilities. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  Our current sales into the Chinese market are about 10 to 15 percent. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=164.56s)]
*  We've been explaining our wines and matching them with the very good Chinese cuisine. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=169.16s)]
*  Taylor says sales in China have doubled over the past four years, as drinking wine became [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=175.92s)]
*  a status symbol for the Chinese middle class. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=180.44s)]
*  To appeal to more Chinese drinkers, Taylor adapted his products. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=185.48s)]
*  The Chinese customers, they're fascinated with technology. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=189.28s)]
*  We have a microchip here. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=193.64s)]
*  It is a great security seal. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=195.88s)]
*  Taylor also uses gold on labels, which is perceived as a lucky color in China. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=199.2s)]
*  He created heavy wooden boxes that he said Chinese customers associate with exclusivity. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  And the company even produced wines that Taylor says Chinese consumers like to have with hot [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=209.55999999999997s)]
*  pot. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=214.04s)]
*  Taylor's isn't the only winery in Australia to have bet big on China. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=216.0s)]
*  Sales there have tripled in the past five years to hit $907 million in 2019. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=220.52s)]
*  Australia's economy as a whole has come to rely on China, sending a third of its exports [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  to the mainland. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=232.56s)]
*  Australia has not had an economic recession in about two decades. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=233.56s)]
*  And much of that is thanks to China's rise. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  Vicky Xu is an analyst who's been studying Australia's increasingly tense relationship [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=243.84s)]
*  with China. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=248.24s)]
*  Despite the closer economic relationship between both countries, Australia's government has [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  been raising its voice on political issues sensitive to Beijing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  People in the business community are very anxious here in Australia. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=258.0s)]
*  The current administration is speaking out assertively on issues like human rights. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  But the question is, can we really stand up for our values despite economic losses? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=266.28s)]
*  We will not be bullied. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=272.24s)]
*  This trade dispute, especially China's wine tariff, has caught the attention of a new [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=274.52s)]
*  alliance of more than 100 lawmakers from more than a dozen countries. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=278.92s)]
*  They say trade policies shouldn't be used as a political tool. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=283.08s)]
*  We are asking you all to join us in standing against Qingyang Ping's authoritarian bullying. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=287.04s)]
*  By drinking a bottle or two of Australian wine. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=292.8s)]
*  As trade disputes multiply in a globalized economy, Vicky Xu says countries that share [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=296.16s)]
*  political values could increasingly rely on each other's market. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=301.04s)]
*  Everyone knows they will have help and they will have backup when they're also being [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=305.84s)]
*  punished by Beijing for perceived indiscretion. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=310.96s)]
*  We really do appreciate our allies and friends coming together. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  We've got an opportunity now to relaunch in the U.S. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  market, the UK and in Canada. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=323.4s)]
*  But because consumers there are different from the Chinese, Taylor is tweaking the marketing [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=328.35999999999996s)]
*  around his lineup of more than 50 bottles. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  The labels in Chinese will have to rip them off. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=335.16s)]
*  We'll have to re-bottle it and then repackage it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=339.0s)]
*  For the U.S. market, Taylor is using floral labels to appeal to young urban consumers [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=342.20000000000005s)]
*  and will start exporting vegan wine to cities like New York and Los Angeles. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=347.48s)]
*  And for the long term, he's planting more Shiraz and Grenache, which are growing in [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=353.6s)]
*  popularity in the West. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=357.32000000000005s)]
*  Still, it'll be difficult to make up for lost business. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=360.68s)]
*  Some Australia-based foreign policy analysts hope with the incoming Biden administration, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=364.32s)]
*  like-minded countries could work together to confront China, as the president-elect [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=369.96s)]
*  has said that he will seek to strengthen global alliances. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=374.0s)]
*  The idea that we're going to be able to deal with China's rogue behavior when we make [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=377.32s)]
*  up 25 percent of the world's economy without bringing in the other 40 percent of our allies [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=381.96s)]
*  is not realistic. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=387.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, China says it's committed to free trade and that its tariff measures are in [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=389.24s)]
*  line with international customary practices and that it's now up to Australia to repair [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=394.44s)]
*  the relationship. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=399.2s)]
*  Taylor knows he's closing out a tough 2020 without the same access to the China market. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=402.16s)]
*  But he says he's learned a lesson for next year. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=406.84000000000003s)]
*  This whole incident has really taught us not to get too focused on one customer. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=409.96000000000004s)]
*  You've just got to diversify and do that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SogOXo7odoY&t=416.16s)]
