# What Is Ant, the Chinese Fintech Giant With Big IPO Plans?  WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [August 24, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM)
*  This app handled more than $15 trillion of transactions last year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=0.0s)]
*  That's more than MasterCard and an amount of money that's similar to the European Union's GDP. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=8.0s)]
*  It also has more than 900 million users in China. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=14.0s)]
*  People use Alipay on buses and taxis, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=18.0s)]
*  to pay their utility bills, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=22.0s)]
*  shop in stores and online, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=25.0s)]
*  and even to buy insurance and make investments. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=27.0s)]
*  And yet many Americans may have never heard of it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=31.0s)]
*  And it's huge in China. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=34.0s)]
*  The Alipay app is essentially a financial supermarket that allows you to do everything on your mobile phone. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=36.0s)]
*  Alipay's parent company Ant Group is getting global attention in 2020. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=43.0s)]
*  Its combined IPOs in Hong Kong and Shanghai could be one of the largest listings ever, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=47.0s)]
*  as Ant is aiming for a market valuation in excess of $200 billion. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=53.0s)]
*  That means it may sell more than $20 billion in shares when it goes public. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=57.0s)]
*  So what is Ant and how did it become so big? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=62.0s)]
*  It all started with Jack Ma, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=68.0s)]
*  the flamboyant Chinese businessman who's known for his inspirational speeches, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=70.0s)]
*  It's not about the money, it's about the dreams. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=74.0s)]
*  extravagant performances at company parties, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=77.0s)]
*  and of course, co-founding Alibaba more than two decades ago, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=82.0s)]
*  which has since become a half-trillion-dollar online shopping giant. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=86.0s)]
*  Alibaba is like a mix of Amazon, eBay and PayPal, also with a dash of Google. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=90.0s)]
*  But it handles more business on its shopping sites than any other company in the world. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=97.0s)]
*  When Alibaba was just starting out, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=103.0s)]
*  it created Alipay as an escrow service to hold money from buyers and release the full price of Alipay. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=105.0s)]
*  Alipay was a service that would help buyers and release the funds to sellers after the goods had been sent and received. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=111.0s)]
*  This built trust between merchants and buyers, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=118.0s)]
*  and helped to pave the way for the e-commerce industry boom in China. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=120.0s)]
*  Not that many people in China have credit cards compared to the U.S. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=124.0s)]
*  With Alipay, most people draw funds directly from their bank accounts [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=128.0s)]
*  and make cashless electronic payments without needing to use credit cards. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=132.0s)]
*  In less than five years, Alipay has expanded to become a ubiquitous app that touches other parts of life. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=137.0s)]
*  Today, Ancrip encompasses not just Alipay, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=142.0s)]
*  but a broader range of financial services including microlending, insurance [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=145.0s)]
*  and one of the largest money market funds in the world called U-About. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=149.0s)]
*  So it's a really flexible tool that gives the average Chinese a little bit of confidence [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=153.0s)]
*  in the way that Alipay is operating. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=158.0s)]
*  And one of the largest money market funds in the world called U-About. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=160.0s)]
*  So it's a really flexible tool that gives the average Chinese consumers and small business owners [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=164.0s)]
*  who have long been ignored by the major banks a taste of what it's like to be able to invest and save money [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=169.0s)]
*  and to get financing to fund operations. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=176.0s)]
*  And all of these are done just through their smartphones almost instantly. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=180.0s)]
*  But the rapid growth of Ant has drawn scrutiny from banks and regulators as previously reported by the Journal. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=185.0s)]
*  Some Chinese banks were earlier concerned that Ant could take away their deposits [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=191.0s)]
*  and reduce how much cash people use. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=195.0s)]
*  Ant is trying to shed its image as a disruptor of China's banking sector. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=197.0s)]
*  This year, the company dropped the word financial services from its name [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=202.0s)]
*  in order to rebrand itself as more of a tech company. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=206.0s)]
*  It also partners with many banks that fund the loans it makes [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=209.0s)]
*  and has made its money market fund less risky. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=212.0s)]
*  Regulators, especially the central bank, they are very concerned about potential liquidity risk [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=215.0s)]
*  in one single fund on the U-About platform. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=222.0s)]
*  The problem is if all investors in this fund decide to draw the money at the same time, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=226.0s)]
*  it could cause huge liquidity risk and even damage the stability of China's financial system. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=233.0s)]
*  Ant responded quickly to regulators' concerns by imposing caps on how much people could invest [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=240.0s)]
*  and opening the platform to rival funds. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=246.0s)]
*  While Ant may have been a bit reluctant to do that to some degree, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=248.0s)]
*  its cooperation with the government really is crucial because in China, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=253.0s)]
*  very few businesses can succeed without blessings from the regulators. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=258.0s)]
*  Outside China, Ant's attempts to expand have sometimes gotten entangled in politics. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=264.0s)]
*  In 2017, Ant tried to buy U.S. money transfer company Moneygram, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=269.0s)]
*  but the deal was scuttled by U.S. officials because of national security concerns. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=273.0s)]
*  That was a really big blow to Ant's ambition to expand in the U.S., [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=278.0s)]
*  which is a very large and potentially lucrative market. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=282.0s)]
*  And this time, Ant's dual IPO with Alibaba will bypass New York. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=286.0s)]
*  A person familiar with the company said Ant never intended to go public in the U.S. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=290.0s)]
*  It has its eyes on India and Southeast Asia, where consumers and businesses are underbanked similar to those in China. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=296.0s)]
*  But Ant's plans aren't to launch Alipay in those markets. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=302.0s)]
*  Ant never intends to serve consumers outside of China via Alipay directly. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=306.0s)]
*  Their approach is to provide some tech or operational expertise [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=312.0s)]
*  in some mobile payment startups in those markets, but they don't really run this business in-house. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=316.0s)]
*  And since Ant has already captured the biggest market in the world, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=322.0s)]
*  it's been laying the groundwork to follow the millions of Chinese tourists who go abroad every year. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=326.0s)]
*  The company has increased partnerships with retailers and restaurants overseas. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=331.0s)]
*  While the pandemic has stifled much of global travel this year, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=336.0s)]
*  the company is not seeing a slowdown of online shopping and cashless payments in China. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=339.0s)]
*  Though Ant will make global headlines when it hits in Hong Kong and Shanghai, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=345.0s)]
*  it may remain a household name only in China. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iGzgbz12hM&t=349.0s)]
