# How to Prepare for a Presidential Run
**The Wall Street Journal - News Explainers:** [January 15, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU)
*  The 2020 election is nearly two years away, but in political terms, that's right around the corner. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=0.0s)]
*  Potential presidential candidates are stepping out of the shadows. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=7.36s)]
*  I'm launching an exploratory committee for president. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=10.24s)]
*  We'll be right here at Guadalupe Plaza to make a big announcement about my 2020 plan. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=13.44s)]
*  So I'm pleased to announce on The View that I'm not ready to make my announcement. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=18.56s)]
*  But let's be real. These politicians aren't just starting to get serious now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  They've been working methodically behind the scenes for months and even years [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=28.959999999999997s)]
*  to bring their likely campaigns to life. Let's take a look at the presidential candidate to-do list. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=32.8s)]
*  Everything a White House hopeful typically gets done before officially announcing their candidacy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=38.32s)]
*  First and foremost, presidential candidates have to start fundraising and establishing [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=44.72s)]
*  donor networks long before their official start date. For example, Senator Elizabeth Warren and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  former secretary Julian Castro have launched exploratory committees. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=54.56s)]
*  We need a strong vision for the future. This allows them to raise and spend money [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=58.24s)]
*  to test the waters. That includes traveling to meet voters and donors and conducting polling. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=62.24s)]
*  Other politicians like Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and former Colorado Governor John [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=69.76s)]
*  Hickenlooper have set up political action committees, or PACs. PACs allow people to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=74.56s)]
*  raise money without the same restrictions that govern campaign donations, and the funds can be [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=80.24s)]
*  used on things like ads and events that help build national support. The money can also be [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  donated to other politicians who can later help with a presidential bid. But the use of PACs [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=91.52s)]
*  could backfire, since they've been shunned by many in the Democratic Party's progressive base. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=96.88s)]
*  And some prospective candidates have even vowed not to use them. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=101.84s)]
*  I don't take PAC money, not a dime. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=104.88s)]
*  Things are a little different for billionaires who might sell fund. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=107.83999999999999s)]
*  It is a very heady thing when people yell, run, run, run. Anybody that thinks it isn't should see a [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=112.0s)]
*  shrink. But most candidates will need to raise some serious cash. In 2016, candidates in outside [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  groups spent nearly two and a half billion dollars on the race to the White House. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=124.8s)]
*  That's according to election watchdog OpenSecrets. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=129.28s)]
*  Those planning to run also need to attract talented staffers, and that can be tough when [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=131.92s)]
*  there's a large pool of potential candidates. Senator Bernie Sanders recently held a Vermont [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=136.64s)]
*  summit through his Sanders Institute that brought together staffers and supporters from 2016. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=142.56s)]
*  And politicians like Cory Booker, Jeff Merkley, and Kirsten Gillibrand have reportedly [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  already reached out to potential hires in key primary states. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  Politicians are also making the rounds with both media tours and road trips to key states, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=156.4s)]
*  like Iowa, where the state's early caucus can make or break a candidate. That includes former [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=161.84s)]
*  Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Cory Booker, Congressman John Delaney, and Governor Steve [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=167.6s)]
*  Bullock. And splashy book tours like those launched by Senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=173.44s)]
*  also raise a candidate's profile. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=178.88s)]
*  The tours help politicians network with key supporters and build name recognition, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=180.96s)]
*  two essential ingredients for a presidential campaign. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=185.52s)]
*  And finally, there's the political platform. Candidates need to be clear about where they stand [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=189.52s)]
*  on the issues before they launch a campaign. Sitting representatives and senators might [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=194.32s)]
*  introduce legislation to establish their positions or sit on key committees to boost their credentials. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=200.08s)]
*  And many looking to enter the race have already launched websites and published videos that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=205.28s)]
*  explain what they're fighting for. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=210.16s)]
*  In total, at least two dozen Democrats are thinking about running. And after they battle each other [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=212.96s)]
*  for the nomination, one will ultimately face, probably the most difficult, a presidential [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=218.64s)]
*  campaign in the history of the United States. And that's going to be the most difficult [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=225.6s)]
*  And after they battle each other for the nomination, one will ultimately face President Trump. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2vV-nlyWU&t=230.8s)]
