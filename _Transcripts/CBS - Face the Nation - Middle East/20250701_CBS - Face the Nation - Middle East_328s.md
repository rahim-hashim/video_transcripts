*  It's being reported that your government has announced that it is accelerating engineering [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=20.84s)]
*  work to reopen access to Fordow. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=26.26s)]
*  What is the status at Fordow? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=29.96s)]
*  No one exactly knows what has transpired in Fordow. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=34.32s)]
*  That being said, what we know so far is that the facilities have been seriously and heavily [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=39.32s)]
*  damaged. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=47.68s)]

*  the assessment and the report of which will be submitted to the government. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=55.38s)]
*  Have Iranian inspectors been able to access Fordow or are they still trying to attempt [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=60.260000000000005s)]
*  to access it? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=65.22s)]
*  It is the Atomic Energy Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran that will have to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=68.10000000000001s)]
*  respond to that question because it is them who are currently doing the inspection and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=73.30000000000001s)]
*  assessment. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=78.78s)]
*  President Trump has made it clear multiple times that Iran's nuclear facilities targeted [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=80.38s)]
*  in those U.S. strikes were, in his words, obliterated. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=85.1s)]
*  Have they been obliterated? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  It appears that they have been heavily and seriously damaged. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=91.86s)]
*  However, I would like to reiterate that I do not have accurate information regarding [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  the damage. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=101.74s)]
*  We need to wait until the reports come in to see whether or not they will be able to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=103.06s)]
*  be relaunched or if they will be relaunched. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=109.06s)]
*  The head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, has told CBS News that Iran could likely [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=113.86s)]
*  start enriching uranium again within a few months. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=120.66s)]
*  Is that your assessment as well? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=125.66s)]
*  His assessment is based on the technological know-how that Iran has got. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=129.14000000000001s)]
*  Iran has got this enrichment industry that is localized. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=138.66s)]
*  We have not imported it from abroad. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=142.34s)]
*  This technology cannot be bombed down. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=146.26s)]
*  One cannot obliterate technology and science of enrichment through bombardment. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=151.45999999999998s)]
*  Therefore, if there is this will on our part, which the will exists there, in order to once [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=156.98s)]
*  again make progress in this industry, we will be able to expeditiously repair the damages [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=164.7s)]
*  and make up for the lost time. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=171.98s)]
*  No one at the moment says that the facilities have remained intact. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=174.98s)]
*  It is the technology and know-how that is still there. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=179.1s)]
*  I don't want to misunderstand you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=182.14s)]
*  If Iran can enrich uranium within a few months' time, will it enrich uranium? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=184.74s)]
*  We are currently in the process of assessments, post-Israeli and American aggression. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=191.82000000000002s)]
*  We are currently developing our policies. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=200.82000000000002s)]
*  Truth be told, we have done a lot for our enrichment industry to thrive. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=205.26000000000002s)]
*  Our scientists have done a lot. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=212.02s)]
*  Our people have borne a lot over the course of the past 20 years, during which Iran has [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=214.46s)]
*  undergone heavy sanctions because of its peaceful nuclear program. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=222.46s)]
*  Our dossier has been submitted to the United Nations Security Council for that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=229.46s)]
*  Our scientists have been assassinated. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=234.9s)]
*  There have been instances of sabotage in our nuclear facilities. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  And now Iran's peaceful nuclear program has turned into a matter of national pride and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=242.18s)]
*  glory. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=250.3s)]
*  We will definitely continue to convince the international community and the countries [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=251.3s)]
*  concerned that our nuclear program will remain absolutely peaceful. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=258.46000000000004s)]
*  As we speak, we have now also gone through a 12-day imposed war in addition to all that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=265.18s)]
*  we have done for this nuclear program. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=272.1s)]
*  And therefore, the people will not easily back down from enrichment and not put it away. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=276.18s)]
*  I would like to assure you, however, that we endeavor so that our nuclear program will [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=285.5s)]
*  remain peaceful. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=293.86s)]
*  I would also like to add that according to the fatwa, that is a religious decree by the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=296.14s)]
*  supreme leader of the Islamic Revolution, nuclear weaponry has no place whatsoever in [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=301.58s)]
*  the security doctrine of the Islamic Republic of Iran and is religiously forbidden. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=308.65999999999997s)]
*  The takeaway, the nuclear know-how remains, but Iran's facilities necessary for it heavily [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=316.46s)]
*  and seriously damaged. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=324.3s)]
*  My thanks to MTS Taiyab for that important interview. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwXffRLvAA&t=325.74s)]
