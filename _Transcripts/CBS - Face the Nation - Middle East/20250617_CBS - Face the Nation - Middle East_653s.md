# Israel and Iran trade new strikes as Trump meets with national security team
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk)
*  President Trump is meeting with his national security team regarding the escalating situation in the Middle East [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Trump left the g7 summit in Canada early as a result of the rising tensions [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=6.28s)]
*  Mr. Trump posted on his truth social platform before heading into the situation room [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=11.76s)]
*  Saying that the u.s. Has quote complete and total control of the skies over Iran [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  He followed up with an additional post saying quote. We know exactly where the so-called supreme leader is hiding [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=22.36s)]
*  He is an easy target, but is safe there [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=28.86s)]
*  We are not going to take him out at least not for now [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=31.4s)]
*  The post falls sources previously telling CBS News that President Trump had opposed an Israeli plan to take out Iran's supreme leader [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=34.82s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the move would ultimately end the conflict [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=43.58s)]
*  The message coincides with a fifth day of exchanges between Israel and Iran [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=49.54s)]
*  Israel says it has thwarted [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=54.5s)]
*  Multiple attempted missile strikes on the country although some have successfully made it through the country's Iron Dome [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=56.42s)]
*  This says Israel is pressing forward with its own strikes aimed at taking out Iran's top military brass [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=63.46s)]
*  And its nuclear sites across the country President Trump discussed the u.s. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=69.98s)]
*  Potentially providing Israel additional air while returning to the u.s. From the g7 summit [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  To deep into it. They just can't have a new one [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=87.14s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News senior White House and political correspondent at o'keefe for more on all of this [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=90.1s)]
*  And great to see you as best you can tell where do things stand in the Middle East for the White House? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=95.66s)]
*  Well, let's begin here at the White House of Meg where the president is set to spend the afternoon meeting with national security [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=102.3s)]
*  Officials about the situation in the Middle East he has spent much of the morning since he returned from Canada earlier this morning [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=107.86s)]
*  On truth social signaling that the United States or at least he is far more actively engaged now and what is going on over there earlier [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=114.36s)]
*  Suggesting that we now control the skies over Iran that brought a lot of pause and questions about whether the United States was now [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  Directly involved and in control of Iranian skies the White House has since clarified that when he said that he did not mean [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=128.52s)]
*  The United States of America is in control of the skies over Iran [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=133.84s)]
*  But it signaled that he was clearly getting some updates and engaging right after that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=138.56s)]
*  He then posted something on truth social suggesting that he knows or the United States is aware of where the Iran's supreme leader is [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=143.6s)]
*  But for now they're not going to kill him and he reiterated a threat that he's been making since last week that should Iran [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=150.96s)]
*  Touch or attack American civilians or soldiers service members in the Middle East the United States would respond forcefully [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=157.48s)]
*  With military might but this statement especially we know exactly where the supreme leader is [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=164.2s)]
*  He's an easy target was one that drew some interesting [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  Reaction and a sign again that he is actively engaging in this during the day today [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  Finally he tweeted a little while ago or truth social the unconditional surrender [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=176.92s)]
*  And that was all that the message said [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  Which again shows that he's trying to get Iran to back down and to engage in some kind of talk [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=183.24s)]
*  He made clear in his flight back from Canada overnight. He's not seeking a ceasefire between Israel and Iran [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  He wants Iran to end its nuclear program and he said he wants a real end to their nuclear problem [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=194.72s)]
*  And would be working on that during the day today [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  So we will see what more we learn about who he's meeting with what they're discussing [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=203.92s)]
*  What the potential diplomatic solutions or military options would be but it is clear that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=208.84s)]
*  As we overheard this morning as a staff call was beginning around here. It's all about Iran today [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=214.84s)]
*  And how is the White House looking to maintain the potential political fallout? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=219.84s)]
*  If if the u.s. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=224.12s)]
*  Actively engages in the Israel Iran war and you're talking domestic political fallout [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=226.0s)]
*  Which isn't we've seen this now in the last day or so bubble up where there are supporters of the president [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=230.72s)]
*  conservative leaders MAGA [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=237.24s)]
*  aficionados essentially saying to him [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  Don't do this to not get involved in another foreign war as other Republican and Democratic presidents have before but especially Republican presidents [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=241.52s)]
*  It was ten years ago this week Meg Oliver that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=248.60000000000002s)]
*  The Donald Trump became a candidate for president and began [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=252.04000000000002s)]
*  Talking about his concerns with US engagement in foreign wars [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=256.56s)]
*  And this morning the vice president JD Vance on his personal or political Twitter account [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=260.56s)]
*  Essentially defended the president to potential MAGA or Republican base voter detractors saying look [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=265.36s)]
*  He's been remarkably consistent on this the US shouldn't engage in this [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=271.98s)]
*  He's also said since he began running ten years ago this week that Iran shouldn't have a nuclear weapon [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=274.64s)]
*  And he says he may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=279.6s)]
*  That decision ultimately belongs to the president and of course people are right to be worried about [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=284.0s)]
*  Foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of as he put it idiotic foreign policy [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=288.24s)]
*  So it's a sign the White House understands that should there be deeper engagement with Iran [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  They may have some political issues here at home most especially with their base [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=296.48s)]
*  Thank you. All right at okey following all of it for us. Thank you and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=301.28s)]
*  Joining us now from herbal is CBS News foreign correspondent Holly Williams [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=305.56s)]
*  Holly how much do we know about what life is like inside Iran right now? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=310.0s)]
*  Hey there Meg well, we know that Iran is reporting more than 200 people killed [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=317.6s)]
*  We know that Israel has targeted and killed nuclear scientists and top military officers in Iran [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=321.72s)]
*  And we know that Israel is also hitting Iranian military facilities and nuclear sites [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=327.08000000000004s)]
*  There are also reports that many people in Iran are fleeing their homes and in particular the capital Tehran for their own safety [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=332.04s)]
*  That said as international journalists [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=339.44s)]
*  We cannot get into Iran right now to report on this conflict from the ground and that is incredibly frustrating [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=342.08000000000004s)]
*  However, where we are here in northern Iraq [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  We're very close to the border with Iran and we've been doing trips up to that border [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=351.92s)]
*  Seeing Iranians coming over that frontier some of them saying that they are fleeing the Israeli airstrikes now [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  Most of those Iranians won't speak to us on camera [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=362.88s)]
*  They say they're frightened of a retribution or punishment from the Iranian government when they go home [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=365.44s)]
*  But what they say off-camera is absolutely fascinating. They've been telling us that they are frightened [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=370.72s)]
*  They've never seen anything like this before and they say that many Iranians are stockpiling food and fuel [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=375.88s)]
*  Some of those Iranians have told us that they believe that the Iranian regime itself is frightened and one man even told us that he [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=382.40000000000003s)]
*  Thinks this could bring down the Iranian regime now that is extremely interesting because when Israel first launched its attack [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=389.88000000000005s)]
*  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu essentially called on ordinary Iranians to rise up against their own government [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=396.68s)]
*  And it is true that many Iranians hate the regime when there have been mass protests [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  They have been met with deadly force [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=408.08000000000004s)]
*  But thinking about the Iranians that we've seen at the border with their country under bombardment [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=411.0s)]
*  They seemed more focused on survival than revolution [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=416.0s)]
*  Survival mode indeed Holly can Israel achieve its goals without support from America [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=419.76s)]
*  Well Meg, you know Israel's already getting us help of a sort to us officials say that the US has been helping to shoot down [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=427.6s)]
*  Iranian missiles including with air defense systems [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=434.04s)]
*  Iran has accused the US of being complicit in Israel's attack and has threatened to target American military bases and for context [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=436.68s)]
*  There are a number of them here in the Middle East as well as around 40,000 US troops [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=443.96000000000004s)]
*  But what's been fascinating to watch is the apparent ease which with which the Israelis have been operating in Iran [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=448.76000000000005s)]
*  operating in Iranian airspace [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  With those targeted killings of scientists and military officials as well as taking out Iranian air defense systems [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=457.04s)]
*  That said and given that the justification for this war on Israel's part was was was was stopping Iran's [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=463.96000000000004s)]
*  Nuclear program we should point out that many experts say that Israel's airstrikes will have been in vain unless they can take out the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=472.0s)]
*  Fordow nuclear site. All right. All right, Holly Williams. Thank you so much [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=479.56s)]
*  For more on this we want to bring in CBS News national security contributor Samantha Vinograd Sam [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=484.52000000000004s)]
*  Thanks for being with us. What is the focus of today's situation room meeting? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=490.12s)]
*  Meg good to be with you having been in these situation room discussions before I can tell you that they typically kick off with an intelligence [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=495.6s)]
*  Assessment in this environment the intelligence assessment would look at really two things [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=502.96000000000004s)]
*  one is the status of Iran's nuclear program after [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=508.36s)]
*  The strikes that have been ongoing for several days and the second intelligence assessment would relate to what the Iranian regime is thinking [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=512.9599999999999s)]
*  Have they decided to really actively engage in nuclear negotiations or are they preparing to fight this out until there is? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=520.42s)]
*  You know [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=527.92s)]
*  There is more of a military option for them to pursue that intelligence assessment would come first [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=528.5s)]
*  from there most likely the president would discuss with this team the safety and security of [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=533.68s)]
*  American personnel in the region and whether to offer any options for American citizens in Israel for example [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=538.66s)]
*  to leave with US government support and then [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=544.74s)]
*  Finally the president will likely spend a significant amount of time [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=548.14s)]
*  Looking at military options to strike Iran as Holly just mentioned the prime target under consideration [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=551.98s)]
*  Is a site called Fordow Fordow has a nuclear facility about 300 feet underground where there are concerns that there is a secret [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=558.98s)]
*  Nuclear breakout program a move by nuclear scientists to try to break out to a nuclear weapon [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=567.0200000000001s)]
*  So the president will likely spend the bulk of his meeting looking at military options to take out the Fordow nuclear facility [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=572.3000000000001s)]
*  So with all of that said Sam you were watching the situation escalate and more time passes by [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=579.46s)]
*  What is the best play at this point for the US? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=586.1s)]
*  The best play in the first instance in the short term is try to protect American citizens [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=589.62s)]
*  I am concerned Meg that there haven't been additional steps taken to facilitate [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=594.22s)]
*  The departure of American citizens in Israel so the best play at this stage [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=599.34s)]
*  Would be to present American citizens with detailed options for the US government to support their departure from Israel [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=603.9399999999999s)]
*  We've done this before when I was in government. We did this post October 7 [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=610.62s)]
*  That's piece one piece two is to rely on the intelligence if the intelligence shows that Iran has still not [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=614.5s)]
*  Decided to break out to a nuclear weapon [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7NuLX5Eurk&t=621.14s)]
