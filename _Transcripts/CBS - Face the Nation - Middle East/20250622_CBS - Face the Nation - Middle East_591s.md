# Massie, Khanna push resolution to rein in president's war powers
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M)
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation. Democrat Ro Khanna joins us from San Francisco and here in studios, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=0.0s)]
*  Kentucky Republican Thomas Massey. And good morning to both of you gentlemen. I'll start with you, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=5.2s)]
*  Congressman Massey. You know, I know this is an unlikely pairing. You are on completely different [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=10.8s)]
*  ends of the political spectrum, but you both worked on this war powers resolution to prohibit [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=16.96s)]
*  U.S. forces from engaging in hostilities against Iran without authorization from Congress. The [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=22.16s)]
*  president just blew right past that. Well, you know, I think I represent part of the coalition [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=26.96s)]
*  that elected President Trump. We were tired of endless wars in the Middle East and tired of wars [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=33.04s)]
*  in Eastern Europe. And we were promised that we would put our veterans, our immigration policies, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=38.0s)]
*  and our infrastructure first. And so what Ro and I did, we did this last week when, you know, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=45.6s)]
*  they were rattling the sabers because we saw this coming. We put forward this war powers [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=52.96s)]
*  resolution. I've teamed up with Ro Khanna before on this to his credit when Joe Biden was president. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=57.36s)]
*  We tried to rein in the executive and reassert Congress's authority, sole authority, to declare [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=62.96s)]
*  war and to engage or authorize the engagement of acts of war. Something we talked to other [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=69.92s)]
*  lawmakers about as well in the Senate. I know there's efforts to support you, but the speaker [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=78.08s)]
*  of the House who is from your own party has really rejected this. He says the Article 1 power of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=83.36s)]
*  Congress really allows for the president to do this. It was a limited necessary targeted strike, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=88.96s)]
*  he says. Well, he's probably referring to the War Powers Act of 1973, but that's been [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=96.16s)]
*  misinterpreted. There were no imminent threat to the United States, which was what would [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=102.08s)]
*  authorize that. And I think that's peculiar to hear that from the speaker of the House. Look, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=108.8s)]
*  Congress was on vacation last week when all this was happening. You haven't been briefed on any of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=113.52s)]
*  these things. We haven't been briefed. They should have called us all back. And frankly, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=118.0s)]
*  we should have debated this War Powers resolution that Ro Khanna and I offered instead of staying [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=121.92s)]
*  on vacation and doing fundraisers and saying, oh, well, the president's got this under control. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=127.68s)]
*  We're going to cede our constitutional authority. Congressman Khanna, and we didn't hear from the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=132.56s)]
*  secretary the explanation as to why now. We haven't heard that from anyone other than a reference to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=138.08s)]
*  the president had a roughly 60 day timeline on diplomatic talks. But we also know we had more [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=144.08s)]
*  talks scheduled when Israel launched this attack. So it's just it's not exactly clear the emergency. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=150.32s)]
*  You will be briefed along with other members of Congress Tuesday. What are the questions you have? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, first of all, the tragedy in this country is that we keep entering these overseas wars. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=167.92s)]
*  We triumphantly declare the mission is accomplished the day after. And then we're left [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=174.16s)]
*  with Americans bearing the consequences for decades. Now, Thomas is absolutely right in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=179.44s)]
*  showing courage. I mean, the headlines all across this country says the United States [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=185.04s)]
*  enters war with Iran. He is actually representing a lot of the people in the MAGA base, people like [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=189.28s)]
*  Steve Bannon, Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Theo Vann, who has had them on, who's saying we [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=195.28s)]
*  don't want this war. And I heard your interview with Secretary Rubio. He's saying, well, we want a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=201.52s)]
*  peace deal. We want to make sure that Iran can enrich uranium through civil purposes. Well, we [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=206.88s)]
*  have that. We have that at the JCPOA. And there was not a single violation that the IAEA found [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=214.0s)]
*  during that time. So my question, I guess, is now you're going to force Iran to go covertly in [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=221.92s)]
*  developing this nuclear material. Now you've put American troops at risk. Now you're wasting [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=227.44s)]
*  billions of our dollars because we're sending more troops to the Middle East. What did you [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=233.12s)]
*  accomplish and why are you oblivious to the American people who are sick of these wars? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=237.04s)]
*  But Congressman, are you open to the idea that there could be intelligence that is disclosed to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=243.6s)]
*  you in this classified setting on Tuesday that could justify this? Or is any military action, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=249.44s)]
*  in your view, war? Well, I'm always open to new intelligence, but the procedure should have been [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=255.44000000000003s)]
*  that Congress was briefed before we decided to enter war and that we actually had a vote on it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=265.44s)]
*  You have Tulsi Gabbard, who just months ago, the director of intelligence, saying that was not the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  case. The reality is, and we should just speak openly, there are people who want regime change [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=276.56s)]
*  in Iran and they are egging this president on to bomb. I hope cooler heads will prevail. We need [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=281.12s)]
*  to pass Thomas Massie and my War Powers Resolution to make it clear that we're not going to get [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=288.16s)]
*  further entrenched into the Middle East. And Congressman Massie, it's interesting because [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=293.36s)]
*  you were talking about a part of the party you represent. The secretary of state comes from a [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=298.4s)]
*  different part of that same party, as you know, and I did hone in on the question about [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=303.2s)]
*  intelligence and what it showed. He called it an ambition to weaponize, weaponization ambition. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=308.32s)]
*  That's different than they're making a nuclear weapon. But are you open to intelligence and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=315.44s)]
*  persuasion here? I'm open as well, but look, in the first Iraq War, the second Iraq War, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  and the war in Afghanistan, Congress first got the briefings. Congress met and debated. It should [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=326.56s)]
*  have been declarations of war, but at least they did an authorization of use of military force. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  We haven't had that. This has been turned upside down, this process. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  You heard from Mitch McConnell, the former Republican leader, the senators say it was a [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=342.64s)]
*  bad week for the isolationists. He was talking about Tucker Carlson and he was talking about [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  Steve Bannon. Do you think that the president is making a choice here or is he trying to have it [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  both ways? Both saying, I'm going to please the hawks of the party by bombing, but then I'm going [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=358.08s)]
*  to say I want a peace deal and make the isolationists happy by saying, I'm not committing to anything [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=363.6s)]
*  more than one and done. Well, I'll concede this. It was a good week for the neocons in the military [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=369.44s)]
*  industrial complex who want war all the time. I wouldn't call my side of the MAGA base [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=374.08000000000004s)]
*  isolationists. We are exhausted. We are tired from all of these wars and we're non-interventionists. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=380.24s)]
*  This was one of the promises. Are you going to call President Trump's campaign an isolationist? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=388.32000000000005s)]
*  His campaign? What he promised us was we would put America first. I think there are still voices [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=393.6s)]
*  in this administration. You've still got JD Vance. You've still got Tulsi Gabbard. You still, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=400.56s)]
*  RFK Jr. You still got calmer heads that could prevail. They were not persuasive in this case, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=406.8s)]
*  clearly. Well, somebody was persuasive. AIPAC is very persuasive. For instance, the Israeli lobby [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=412.8s)]
*  in Congress, if you look at my colleagues' feeds now, they all look the same. They're all tweeting [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  the same message that we've got to support Israel and we've got to do this. My question is, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=424.64s)]
*  three bombings and we're done with Iran's nuclear ambitions, is that the two weeks to slow the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=430.8s)]
*  spread of 2025? We were told two weeks to slow the spread then. Now we're told it's just going [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=438.08s)]
*  to take three bombings. But what happens when Israel gets bombed again? Is Trump going to sit [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=444.0s)]
*  by and say, no, we're not going to further engage in this war? I tried to get answers from the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=449.68s)]
*  secretary on that question. But when you say the pro-Israel lobby, AIPAC, do you see a difference [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=453.52s)]
*  between Israel's interest and American interests? Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, look, Iran, the reality [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=461.44s)]
*  is they don't have a missile that can reach the United States. They're not near to getting a missile [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=467.68s)]
*  that can reach the United States. I think this, what has happened, what has transpired this week [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=472.56s)]
*  has been planned for months. That this administration and maybe even the administration [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=478.64s)]
*  prior to that said, you go in and soften them up, take out their air defense capabilities, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=484.4s)]
*  and then we'll send in the big bombers. Congressman Kana, I know you have raised [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=489.52s)]
*  objections on this program in the past about Israel's operations in Gaza for how it has [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=494.4s)]
*  conducted that war against Hamas. That was a different context. But now you very well may be [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=499.52s)]
*  asked to provide more weaponry to Israel to defend itself. Do you oppose that as well? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, first let me just say that it's a totally unfair smear to call people isolationists, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=514.8s)]
*  the vast majority of Americans who don't want war war and want diplomacy. Diplomacy and engagement [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=520.56s)]
*  is not isolationism. But look on Israel, I have supported aid and support defensively. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=526.4s)]
*  And even the War Powers Resolution says that if Iran is striking Israel, we can provide defense [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=534.16s)]
*  so that Israel isn't hit. What I opposed was giving Israel offensive weapons to go [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=541.1999999999999s)]
*  kill more people in Gaza. I think that war needs to end. But I think the bottom line, Margaret, is [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=547.92s)]
*  what have we achieved here? We're going to push Iran to now be like Pakistan or North Korea, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=552.88s)]
*  going and trying to develop a nuclear bomb covertly. We have put more American troops at risk. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=558.4s)]
*  We're going to spend more resources going and getting more entrenched in the Middle East. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=564.8s)]
*  And we've created a generation of hate. It's like, can this country learn? We keep voting for people, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  for presidents who say we're not going to get into war, and then they keep getting pushed [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=574.96s)]
*  by the Washington Beltway to get us into this mess. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=578.96s)]
*  AMNA NAWAZ [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=581.84s)]
*  Congressman Kana, Congressman Massey, thank you. And a rare bipartisan [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=583.52s)]
*  meeting of the minds, at least on this issue. We'll be right back. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPmUmIj60M&t=587.04s)]
