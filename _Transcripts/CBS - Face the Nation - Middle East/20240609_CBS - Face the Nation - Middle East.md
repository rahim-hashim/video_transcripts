# Face the Nation: Graham, Coons, McCain
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI)
*  We turn now to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. He joins us from London. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning to you, Senator. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=5.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=8.24s)]
*  I know you were at those D-Day remembrances earlier in the week, and you met with President [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=8.96s)]
*  Zelensky as well. He has asked for more training for his forces and for that to happen faster and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=14.4s)]
*  inside of Ukraine. Do you support the U.S. doing that? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Yes, I do support us training inside the country. You know the delay in weapons because of house [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=25.92s)]
*  inaction, we did lose momentum. But from the very beginning, the Biden administration, they did not [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  impose pre-invasion sanctions to deter Putin. They didn't give weapons to Ukraine early on to deter [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=42.72s)]
*  Putin. And now we've got a chance to reset this war that they have the weapons. Here's what he [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=48.72s)]
*  wanted most of all, for us to go after the Russian assets all over the world, take the money from the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=54.0s)]
*  sovereign wealth funds of Russia and give it to Ukraine. There's $300 billion sitting in Europe [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=60.32s)]
*  from Russian sovereign wealth assets that we should seize and give to Ukraine. We have Russian [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=68.08s)]
*  money in America we should seize. We should make Russia a state sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=74.32s)]
*  When I suggested that to President Zelensky, he lit up like a Christmas tree. Making Russia a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=80.64s)]
*  state sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law would be a very big blow to Russia. Right. I don't know [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=86.32s)]
*  that the Biden administration would sign off on that though. But in terms of what you just mentioned [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=94.08s)]
*  with the assets, President Biden did say this morning he had reached an agreement with President [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=99.76s)]
*  Macron of France on the use of profits from those frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine. I know the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=105.36s)]
*  Europeans haven't wanted to go ahead and seize assets because it would hurt their banks. Yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=112.0s)]
*  Well, they want to use the interest to help you. Either we're going to help Ukraine or we're not. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=118.32s)]
*  It's now time to give them the F-16s, let them fly the planes, long-range artillery to hit targets [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=123.28s)]
*  inside of Russia, go after Putin's assets wherever they're at, all over the world, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=130.4s)]
*  go on the offensive. I think this summer Ukraine will regain military momentum. Everything we've [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=135.12s)]
*  done with Ukraine has been slow, it's been indecisive. But if we went after the assets [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=142.08s)]
*  that Putin has all over the world, take his money that's stolen from the Russian people and help [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=147.76s)]
*  the victims in Ukraine, I think it would do a lot to end this war. Your Republican colleague, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=154.32s)]
*  Senator Tommy Tuberville, just this past week said on Steve Bannon's show that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=161.2s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky is a dictator and unconstitutional. And he said this about Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=166.16s)]
*  Those echo some Russian talking points, Senator. I wonder if those remarks from your fellow Senator [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=184.56s)]
*  represent the GOP. No, it represents him and him alone. If you spend 15 minutes studying Putin and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=193.68s)]
*  what he wants, he wants to recreate the Russian empire. He's not going to stop in Ukraine. We [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  celebrated the 80th anniversary of D-Day. It was a failure. It was the unnecessary war [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=208.4s)]
*  described by Winston Churchill. We had a dozen chances to stop Hitler. It's not about NATO, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=216.32s)]
*  it's not about American weapons in Ukraine. It's about a megalomaniac wanting to create the Russian [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=223.44s)]
*  empire by force of arms. If you don't stop him, there goes Taiwan. So we've been slow as hell of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=229.68s)]
*  helping Ukraine, but Senator Tuberville's analysis really misses what Putin's all about. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=236.8s)]
*  He's an outlier, I think, in the Republican Party. I like him personally. But what did Trump do to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=242.88000000000002s)]
*  get the weapons flowing? He created a loan system. They're sitting on 10 to 12 trillion dollars [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=249.36s)]
*  of critical minerals in Ukraine. They could be the richest country in all of Europe. I don't [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=256.08000000000004s)]
*  want to give that money and those assets to Putin to share with China. If we help Ukraine now, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=262.24s)]
*  they can become the best business partner we ever dreamed of. That 10 to 12 trillion dollars of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=268.24s)]
*  critical mineral assets could be used by Ukraine and the West, not given to Putin and China. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=273.2s)]
*  This is a very big deal how Ukraine ends. Let's help them win a war we can't afford to lose. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=279.36s)]
*  Let's find a solution to this war. But they're sitting on a gold mine to give Putin 10 or 12 [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=285.68s)]
*  trillion dollars of critical minerals that he will share with China is ridiculous. I want to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=291.84s)]
*  get to the Middle East with you as well. Later today, Benny Gantz, one of the ministers in [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=298.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu's war cabinet, is expected to announce his resignation, which he has previously [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=303.67999999999995s)]
*  said would happen if he wasn't handed a day after plan. The defense minister has also said [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  there is no planning for the day after happening. Where is this headed? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=314.96s)]
*  I think Mr. Gantz will withdraw from the war cabinet, but Bibi will still have a majority. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=322.23999999999995s)]
*  I like Benny Gantz. Here's what I found on my last trip to Israel just a few days ago. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=327.67999999999995s)]
*  There's universal opposition to creating a Palestinian state by all levels of Israeli society [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=334.23999999999995s)]
*  if it is seen as a reward for terrorism of October the 7th. The day after plan, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=341.76s)]
*  when Hamas is destroyed militarily and they no longer can threaten Israel, needs to be a [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=347.2s)]
*  negotiation between Israel and Saudi Arabia and the UAE to come up with a plan for Gaza and the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=353.2s)]
*  West Bank to give the Palestinians hope and a better life and secure Israel. That is the only [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  plan I see working. You cannot occupy, Israel can't in my view, permanently Gaza. That will be a [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  disaster for Israel. Prime Minister Netanyahu hasn't said that clearly yet, that he would not [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=374.0s)]
*  seek to occupy. He's coming July the 24th. I've spent a lot of time with Bibi. He is right to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=379.28s)]
*  want to make sure there will be no stop to this war until Hamas is destroyed militarily and cannot [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=387.84s)]
*  threaten another October 7th. I've had very detailed discussions with the prime minister [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=394.0s)]
*  and with the crown prince and this administration. I believe there will be forming in the next week. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=400.64s)]
*  I want to talk to you more about this. There will be a plan coming about. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=406.4s)]
*  All right, we have to talk more about this on the other side of the commercial break though, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  so just give me a minute or two and we'll be right back. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation now with South Carolina Republican [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=422.24s)]
*  Senator Lindsey Graham. Senator, thank you for staying through the break for us. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=426.96s)]
*  Before we went to it, you said by July 24th when the prime minister of Israel is here in Washington [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=431.28s)]
*  to address the joint session of Congress, you do expect a plan for the day after. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=436.96s)]
*  Do you expect, given the limited amount of time left, that there will be normalization [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=441.52s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia and Congress will be able to vote before the election? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=447.2s)]
*  I think it's still possible, but the administration's taken months to negotiate [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=450.64s)]
*  the defense agreement between Saudi Arabia and the United States. Holding it over Israel's head [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=456.8s)]
*  regarding Ra'aq, I think we're almost there. One thing I got from this trip was that they still [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=463.36s)]
*  don't have the weapons they need in Israel to finish off Hamas, so they're going to be sending [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  me a list of weapons that are being slow-walked, so I'm going to bring that up. But yeah, I think [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=473.36s)]
*  we can still do this. July 24th will be here before you know it. Hopefully, major military [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=478.08s)]
*  operations will be over against Hamas if we give Israel the weapons they need, and we can sit down [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=483.35999999999996s)]
*  and talk about a vision for Gaza and the West Bank that will give security to Israel, hope and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=488.96s)]
*  prosperity for the Palestinian people with Saudi Arabia and the UAE involved. So that is my hope, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=494.64s)]
*  that is my belief, and I want to help where I can. We'll see if that vote can be taken. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=500.64s)]
*  But sir, you just mentioned U.S. military aid. Our poll out today shows a majority of Americans, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=506.08s)]
*  61 percent, say the U.S. should not send Israel weapons. Six in 10 says Israel should stop or [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=512.8s)]
*  decrease its military actions in Gaza. Isn't it time for this war to end now, given that the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  tide of public opinion is turning against Israel? I think it'd be the biggest mistake we could [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=526.8s)]
*  make. I criticized Senator Turbeville for his view of Ukraine. Let me be straight with you. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=535.04s)]
*  Hamas would kill everybody here if they could get here. Israel is not our enemy. They're our ally. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, they can't because they're pinned down over there. I want them destroyed so they can [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=547.28s)]
*  never come back to hurt Israel or us. Hezbollah is alive and well. So to those Americans who believe [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=551.68s)]
*  pulling the plug on Israel now makes us safer, you've missed a lot. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=559.28s)]
*  Radical Islam wants to slit the throat of every Jewish person and your throat too. So no, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=563.04s)]
*  I want to give weapons they need. The administration is withholding weapons. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=569.04s)]
*  Trump was a great ally of Israel. If he wins this election, he'll have another great ally. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=574.0799999999999s)]
*  I appreciate what President Biden's doing, but it's all been so slow. So if you don't, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=579.76s)]
*  Iran, here's the big takeaway from my trip. The IDF chief told me he's never been more worried [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=585.28s)]
*  about a nuclear breakout regarding the Iranians and the Iyars right now. He thinks we've lost [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=592.0s)]
*  deterrence. He's asking for joint military operations with the United States to convince [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=596.72s)]
*  Iran not to dash toward a nuclear weapon. These are the most dangerous times since the 30s. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=602.4s)]
*  Don't make the mistakes of the 30s. Senator Turbeville said give Putin what he wants. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=607.84s)]
*  Well, that's what we did in the 30s. That didn't work out. Pull the plug on Israel. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=612.4s)]
*  That didn't work in World War II. It's not going to work now. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=616.56s)]
*  Very quickly before I let you go, in this past year, the Biden administration deported, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  expelled or repatriated more than 740,000 people, which they say is more than any year since 2010. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=624.0s)]
*  You this week said there need to be mass deportations. Aren't those numbers mass [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=630.72s)]
*  deportations? They've had 10 million people come into this country illegally. It's the highest [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=635.9200000000001s)]
*  level of illegal immigration in the last three years in the history of the country. We went from [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=642.6400000000001s)]
*  the lowest under Trump to the highest in recorded history. They're never going to stop coming until [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=647.44s)]
*  they see people leaving. On day one, President Trump will deport people here legally by the [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=652.4000000000001s)]
*  tens of thousands. Then and only then will this stop, and Biden will never do that. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=659.36s)]
*  Well, you also know that Congress would have to provide the resources to do that to [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=665.5200000000001s)]
*  Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, and they say they don't have the manpower or the money to [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=669.6800000000001s)]
*  do any of that. Well, if Trump is president, his top priority will seal that border, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=674.08s)]
*  deport here people illegally. We're living on borrowed time when it comes to another 9-11. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=682.32s)]
*  If you're looking for somebody to fix a broken border and keep us safe, Donald Trump, I believe, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=686.8000000000001s)]
*  is your best choice. If you don't believe that after the last three years, you're making a big mistake. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=692.08s)]
*  Senator Graham, joining us from London today. Thank you for your time, sir. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=698.08s)]
*  We turn now to Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons. He is a national co-chairman of [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=702.24s)]
*  President Biden's re-election campaign, and he joins us this morning from his home state. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=706.8s)]
*  Senator, let's pick up on the border since we just left that there. This new order the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=712.88s)]
*  president just implemented this past week authorizes immigration officials to deport [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=718.16s)]
*  large numbers of migrants without processing their asylum claims. You were critical when [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=723.68s)]
*  Donald Trump used this 212-F authority under his administration. Why do you support President Biden's [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=728.88s)]
*  use of it? Because there's a stark difference in the values that President Biden and former [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=734.56s)]
*  President Trump bring to trying to address the issue of border security and immigration. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=740.08s)]
*  I'll remind you, Margaret, that former President Trump tried to implement a Muslim ban, a ban on [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=744.96s)]
*  entry to this country explicitly based on one religion. He also used cruelty, the forceful [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=751.04s)]
*  separation of parents from their children and the caging of children at our border to try and deter [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=757.04s)]
*  folks from coming to seek asylum or to seek refuge in our country. President Biden has time and time [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=762.7199999999999s)]
*  again asked Congress to enact a broad solution to our border security and immigration challenges. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=769.04s)]
*  And after months of negotiation between Senators Langford, Sinema and Murphy, we were one day away [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=775.76s)]
*  from putting on the floor of the Senate that bipartisan solution. Former President Trump [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=782.0799999999999s)]
*  intervened to stop it because former President Trump actually wants a problem to solve through [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=786.8s)]
*  his election rather than a solution that a bipartisan group of senators stood behind. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=792.3199999999999s)]
*  President Biden is moving ahead with forceful leadership at securing our border. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=797.92s)]
*  President Trump is simply making a political issue of this. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=802.7199999999999s)]
*  And we should say you are co-chair of the Biden campaign, Senator, but we did cover that border [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=806.0799999999999s)]
*  debate and the bill in depth on this program. But on the premise itself of the authority being used, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=813.76s)]
*  there is a lot of approval in our polling of what the president just did. But it looks, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=820.3199999999999s)]
*  frankly, like they're just trying to get caught trying since the administration admits the courts [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=825.92s)]
*  likely will halt this. The ACLU says they're going to sue over it. Asylum is a human right under [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=829.76s)]
*  international law. What do you think this is signaling to Biden supporters, particularly in [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=835.2s)]
*  the progressive left of your party? I think it's signaling that President Biden is determined to [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=840.64s)]
*  address issues that are a very broad concern to the vast majority of Americans. He would [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=846.16s)]
*  prefer that it be done by legislation, as you just pointed out, legislation that could provide the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=851.36s)]
*  resources, the judges, the processing, the immigration funding that would make for a more [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=857.36s)]
*  balanced, humane and sustainable solution to our border crisis. I'll remind you, former President [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=863.36s)]
*  Trump tried to use gimmicks like building a border wall and is now threatening to nationalize the [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=868.56s)]
*  to federalize the National Guard and use it to deport tens of millions of people already here [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=874.8s)]
*  in the United States. The difference between Trump's approach and Biden's approach is one of [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=880.16s)]
*  cruelty versus effectiveness. So only in our polling, only about 20 percent believe President [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=885.4399999999999s)]
*  Biden's policies would decrease the number of migrants. Are you worried that it's just simply [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=891.04s)]
*  too late? I mean, we've been talking about process in Congress. We've been talking about [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=896.08s)]
*  this executive order for months now and the trigger was just pulled this week. Is it too late? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=900.5600000000001s)]
*  No, I don't think it is because frankly, I think the American people understand the difference [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=907.5200000000001s)]
*  between substance and showmanship. President Biden every year in his state of the union has [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=911.9200000000001s)]
*  asked for bipartisan initiatives to address the border and to address immigration. And there's [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=918.08s)]
*  one party, the Republican Party, that time and time again has rejected bipartisan solutions to [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=924.16s)]
*  immigration and the border. And frankly, what I also hear as I've campaigned across our country [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=930.0799999999999s)]
*  for our president is grave concern about the commitment to reproductive rights, to fundamental [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=935.76s)]
*  freedoms by the current MAGA Republican majority and by former President Trump. He is bragging [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=941.1999999999999s)]
*  that he nominated to the Supreme Court three justices who reversed Roe versus Wade and who [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=947.4399999999999s)]
*  have now put contraception at risk. That's why we took a vote in the Senate last week, Margaret, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=952.88s)]
*  to make it clear that Democrats will protect fundamental rights where Republicans under the [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=958.4s)]
*  leadership of former President Trump are putting them at real risk. I want to ask you about the [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=963.92s)]
*  Middle East. You described Prime Minister Netanyahu's last address to a joint session [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=969.2s)]
*  of Congress in 2015 as a political rally against then President Obama. We're in this election year, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=974.88s)]
*  there has been tension between our two leaders. Do you expect the prime minister to have an [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=982.48s)]
*  election rally against President Biden? Boy, I sure hope not. But Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=988.96s)]
*  has a long record of being very partisan and very divisive. For decades, Margaret, the strong [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=995.6s)]
*  bipartisan support for Israel, for its security, has been a hallmark of our close alliance. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1001.84s)]
*  But I'll remind you, Prime Minister Netanyahu isn't just divisive here, he's divisive at home. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1008.32s)]
*  For months and months before the October 7 attacks, the largest protests in Israeli history [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1013.2s)]
*  were occurring week after week in the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem against steps that [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1020.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu was taking, putting at risk the rule of law. And Benny Gantz, a centrist, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1025.52s)]
*  decorated IDF war hero, will likely today announce that he is leaving Netanyahu's war cabinet [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1031.6000000000001s)]
*  because there's no clear plan for the path forward. Our president, Joe Biden, has been [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1037.92s)]
*  leading a strong effort to try and secure a hostage release and a ceasefire. It's been embraced by all [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1043.1200000000001s)]
*  of our close allies in the G7. And it's my hope that that can still be accomplished. But frankly, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1049.76s)]
*  if Netanyahu isn't coming to speak to Congress about his plan for securing peace, his plan for [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1055.8400000000001s)]
*  the path forward, I don't know why we would go. Yeah. So why would the Democratic leader in the [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1062.0800000000002s)]
*  Senate agree to something that could potentially be so damaging to the president? Well, Senator [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1067.36s)]
*  Schumer has publicly said that it was with some reluctance, some concern about how Prime Minister [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1073.12s)]
*  Netanyahu has this past practice of using an address to Congress to be divisive. He has a chance to [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1078.24s)]
*  help rebuild and secure bipartisan support for Israel. He has a chance to present a positive [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1085.4399999999998s)]
*  path forward towards peace. Look, I respect how hard Lindsey Graham, Senator Graham, has worked [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1091.28s)]
*  to try and bring together Saudi normalization with Israel in exchange for Palestinian self-governance. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1096.24s)]
*  That's an important effort many of us have been involved in. Prime Minister Netanyahu has a chance [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1103.2s)]
*  to show that he will be a real leader, not just a partisan leader, but someone who will try and [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1108.16s)]
*  secure peace and stability for Israel. It's my hope that that's what will happen and that that's [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1114.16s)]
*  why Senator Schumer agreed to invite him to speak to a joint session of Congress. Senator Coons, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1118.8s)]
*  thank you for joining us today. Thank you. We'll be right back. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1124.4s)]
*  We're joined now by the Executive Director of the United Nations World Food Program, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1136.64s)]
*  Cindy McCain. Good to have you here in person. Thank you. Now, overnight we learned that that [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1140.4s)]
*  U.S. pier off of Gaza that was set up by the military has reopened. It had stopped functioning [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1146.0s)]
*  for a bit. How is it going? Because I know you are helping to oversee distribution. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1152.4s)]
*  Well, right now we're paused because I'm concerned about the safety of our people [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1158.5600000000002s)]
*  after the incidents yesterday. We also, two of our warehouses, the warehouse complex, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1163.0400000000002s)]
*  were rocketed yesterday. So we've stepped back just for the moment to make sure that we're [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1168.64s)]
*  on safe terms and on safe ground before we'll restart. But the rest of the country is [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1175.3600000000001s)]
*  operational. We're doing everything we can in the north and the south. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1180.64s)]
*  How did your locations get rocketed? I imagine you do de-conflict and share your locations with [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1184.72s)]
*  the Israeli military. We are de-conflicted. I don't know. That's a good question. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1191.1200000000001s)]
*  Did you lose any of your— We had one man injured, but everything else is fine. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1196.0s)]
*  Nobody else hurt. But indeed, it's a kind of thing. That's why a ceasefire is necessary. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1200.5600000000002s)]
*  That's why we need to stop this so that we can get in at scale with our aid and other aid from [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1206.72s)]
*  other organizations as well. We can't continue this in a way because what almost happened in [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1213.44s)]
*  the north with famine could happen in the south. And so that's what we're trying to avoid right [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1219.84s)]
*  now. And it's been very difficult just because of what's going on. We've had looting inside the [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1227.1200000000001s)]
*  country. We've had various problems around with it. There's always something going on. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1232.64s)]
*  It's very difficult to operate there. You mentioned just now the full-blown famine [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1238.3200000000002s)]
*  in the north. When you said that, it got a lot of attention. Prime Minister Netanyahu was asked [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1245.76s)]
*  about your comments by NBC and said, quote, Cindy McCain unfortunately is misinformed. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1250.72s)]
*  The Israeli government's been putting out pictures of food being brought into Gaza. They dispute there is famine. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1257.0400000000002s)]
*  How does that square with what you are seeing on the ground? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1265.7600000000002s)]
*  When I made that comment, my people had seen it on the ground, not only evidence of the actual [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1268.88s)]
*  impact of it. Since then, they've allowed us to get more trucks into the north. And so we're [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1274.48s)]
*  getting much more food in up there, and that will stave it off. But listen, the bottom line here is [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1280.0s)]
*  that I make choices every day to take food from the hungry to give to the starving. We need to [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1286.8s)]
*  ceasefire. We need it now so that we can feed. And this doesn't happen in the south. We're right on [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1292.08s)]
*  the edge in the south of the same thing occurring. You're on the edge of famine in the south of Gaza? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1297.84s)]
*  Yes. There's people that are very hungry and don't have access because of the danger, because they've [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1302.1599999999999s)]
*  been pushed into the center again. So we want to make sure that we can not just get in and feed, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1307.68s)]
*  but do it at scale. They need more than food, too. It's water. It's sanitation. It's medicine. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1313.44s)]
*  So it's all of the above, because famine is not just about starving. It's about all the other [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1319.28s)]
*  things, too. And I know how difficult I've heard it is to help a child with stunted growth. You just [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1323.92s)]
*  said you're taking from the hungry to feed the starving. You are dealing with a lot in Sudan, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1332.24s)]
*  as well. The United States said paramilitary forces murdered 100 people this past week, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1337.52s)]
*  including children. And I know the Biden administration says the world's not paying [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1344.16s)]
*  enough attention to Sudan. What's happening? And are they already at famine? Well, Sudan has the [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1349.68s)]
*  real possibility of becoming the world's largest humanitarian crisis. We cannot get food in. We [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1358.32s)]

*  of what can happen if people aren't fed. We're also coming into the lean season, which makes it [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1370.32s)]
*  very difficult many times for our trucks to even operate if they can get in. We need more crossings. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1375.3600000000001s)]
*  We need safe and unfettered access. And that's the same for Gaza, by the way, safe and unfettered [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1382.48s)]
*  access. And making sure that we can get in and make sure we can feed at scale. Once again, it's [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1387.6000000000001s)]
*  about the agreements from various people and various factions and all of this. Bottom line is [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1394.08s)]
*  people are going to starve to death unless we can get in there. We've been talking a whole week long [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1400.0s)]
*  about America's role in the world, and the U.S. is still the largest donor to the World Food Program. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1404.6399999999999s)]
*  When you were here last June and we spoke, you said you were trying to encourage China to get [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1410.8799999999999s)]
*  involved with funding, but also get their expertise with technology and agriculture. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1416.8s)]
*  Are they stepping up at all? Are other countries stepping up? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1422.08s)]
*  Other countries are stepping up. It's not to the scale that it was two years ago, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1425.6s)]
*  but countries have stepped up. And in the case of Sudan, a few more have stepped up to it. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1431.44s)]
*  Sudan is a forgotten crisis, and its implications being a destabilizing factor in that region [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1437.76s)]
*  can have catastrophic effects as it comes down the line. So it's really imperative that we get [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1444.72s)]
*  the crossings open, that we have safe access, that the various factions understand that we [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1451.04s)]
*  work humanitarian and we need to have the access. And to your point, U.S. intelligence has said that [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1458.32s)]
*  if this isn't acted upon, that it can contribute to the growth of terrorism. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1463.76s)]
*  Absolutely. People will do anything to feed their families, and if it comes down to it, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1468.24s)]
*  terrorism may be the choice they have to make. Cindy McCain, thank you for sharing with us. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1473.28s)]
*  Thank you. Thanks for covering. Thank you. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1478.16s)]

*  President Biden this morning ended his trip to France by laying a wreath at a cemetery just [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1486.0s)]
*  outside of Paris, where American soldiers and Marines were buried in World War I. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1491.0400000000002s)]
*  Shortly after, he explained why the trip was necessary. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1496.8000000000002s)]
*  The idea that I'd come to Normandy and not make this short trip here to pay tribute, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1500.56s)]
*  and it's the same story. Think about it. America showed up. America showed up to stop the Germans, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1509.28s)]
*  and America shows up when we need it, just like our allies show for us. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1518.08s)]
*  Earlier this week, the president marked 80 years since the D-Day invasion that helped begin the [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1524.32s)]
*  liberation of Europe from Nazi control and touted American leadership and democracy on the world [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1529.12s)]

*  at Normandy, Walter Cronkite returned there with Dwight Eisenhower. You see that high ground out [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1543.36s)]
*  above there? The former president reflected on his decision as supreme allied commander [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1548.8s)]
*  to storm the beaches and liberate Europe from Nazi Germany. I devoutly hope [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1554.4s)]
*  that we will never again have to see such scenes as these, but these people gave us a chance [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1561.76s)]
*  and they bought time for us so that we can do better than we have before. This week, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1569.0400000000002s)]
*  President Biden, a small child in 1944, praised the few surviving veterans whose bravery he said [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1574.5600000000002s)]
*  we need to summon again. We're living in a time when democracy is more at risk across the world [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1582.0s)]
*  than any point since the end of World War II, since these beaches were stormed in 1944. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1587.84s)]
*  The tyrant bent on domination now, he said, is Vladimir Putin, whose soldiers have taken [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1595.04s)]
*  Ukrainians from their homes away to filtration camps, abducted Ukrainian children, and sent [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1601.04s)]
*  invading forces to ravage Ukraine. Putin's axis of allies includes rising power China, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1607.28s)]
*  North Korea, and Iran. The autocrats of the world are watching closely to see what happens in Ukraine [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1614.8s)]
*  to see if we let this illegal aggression go unchecked. Biden wasn't the only one hearing [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1622.96s)]
*  echoes of the past. Oh, you saved the people. 99 year old D. Day vet Melvin [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1628.96s)]
*  Hurwitz called President Zelensky a hero. Former President Donald Trump has a very different [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1637.12s)]
*  opinion of Zelensky and Trump argues the largest invasion in history is underway now at the U.S. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1643.6s)]

*  from the enemy from within with these lunatics, these fascists, these communists, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1664.96s)]
*  and we're going to stop that also. Past presidents have also gone to Normandy and called on weary [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1669.92s)]
*  Americans to remember that deterring conflict today costs less than fighting it tomorrow. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1675.5200000000002s)]
*  We've learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1681.8400000000001s)]

*  international system. Similar divides here at home raise questions about whether we've forgotten [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1699.8400000000001s)]
*  that ignoring hate or appeasing authoritarians can come with an unimaginably high cost. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1707.1200000000001s)]
*  One paid 80 years ago by these troops who, as Eisenhower said, bought time for us so that we [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1714.64s)]
*  can do better than we have before. We'll be right back. That's it for us today. Thank you [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPzpuFeEkI&t=1721.92s)]
