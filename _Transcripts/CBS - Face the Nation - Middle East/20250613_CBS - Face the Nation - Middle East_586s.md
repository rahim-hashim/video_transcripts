# Sirens blare across Israel after Iran launches retaliatory attack
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc)
*  All right, you've just been watching a CBS News special report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=0.0s)]
*  Air raid sirens are blaring across Israel as the country's military works to intercept [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=3.08s)]
*  dozens of missiles fired from Iran. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  The missile attacks follow Israel's widespread operation targeting Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=9.86s)]
*  Scientists and top military officials, several of Israel's intended targets were killed. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=16.16s)]
*  The IDF says it is continuing to target other nuclear sites across the country. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=20.48s)]
*  And CBS News Middle East reporter Courtney Keeley is back with me here in Studio 57. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=25.28s)]
*  So Courtney, talk about the significance of what we're seeing right now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=29.92s)]
*  Well, this is the retaliation that Israel must have been bracing for. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=33.88s)]
*  It's Shabbat, it's nighttime, and immediately Israelis and civilians there were ordered [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=37.6s)]
*  to go into shelters. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  Air sirens were sounding the alarm across the country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  The IDF said something up to 100 ballistic missiles were being intercepted, but we're [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=49.88s)]
*  also seeing that plume of smoke over a residential area of Tel Aviv. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  And it's questionable whether some have gotten through or will they? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=58.3s)]
*  This requires not just Israel on an all-out defensive stance, it requires their Operation [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=62.82s)]
*  Iron Dome to work, the Patriot battery missiles, defense missiles to work, and also regional [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=69.5s)]
*  allies that often happen in a covert level to aid in getting those missiles out of the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=75.5s)]
*  sky and not landing in civilian areas in Israel or in Israel proper. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=80.62s)]
*  It's a very different scene than Iran that has no air sirens and that has no shelters. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=86.84s)]
*  And that's something Iranians were saying. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=91.74000000000001s)]
*  We don't even have, we didn't even hear air sirens last night where we weren't even notified. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  And then you saw residential buildings being hit in Iran, which means like concussion strikes, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=99.2s)]
*  like terrifying sounds of bombings happening all over Iran, taking out, as you said, nuclear [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  scientists taking out top military commanders that the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has said [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=113.36s)]
*  have already been replaced, going after military sites, going after arsenals of ballistic missiles, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=119.96s)]
*  and going after the oil refinery. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=125.97999999999999s)]
*  So much is unconfirmed coming out of Iran, but I can tell you there are also protests [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=128.64s)]
*  being reported. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  They have a widespread internet that's still functioning, maybe not as good as it was last [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  night, but information is coming out. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=141.16s)]
*  I'm hearing in the town of Isfahan, the city of Isfahan, that people are actually saying [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=143.52s)]
*  death to Khamenei. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=148.04s)]
*  These are not people in general that want to see this regime be kept in place, but they [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=149.56s)]
*  don't want to see civilian strikes and they don't want Israel bombing their country either. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=155.48s)]
*  Robert, I want to turn to you now and bring you back in. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=159.4s)]
*  I know you were halfway through a thought. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=162.84s)]
*  Robert Berger is joining us for all those viewing from Jerusalem. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=166.28s)]
*  Just give me some flavor about what the situation is on the ground where you are. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=170.88000000000002s)]
*  What are you seeing and hearing, Robert? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=176.4s)]
*  Well, a little while ago here in Jerusalem, we heard air raid sirens. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=178.4s)]
*  We're not hearing them right now. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=183.32000000000002s)]
*  Most of the activity, the missile activity, seems to be in the Tel Aviv area, but right [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=185.78s)]
*  now also missiles going off in Haifa, that's a northern Israeli city, and the country is [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=191.5s)]
*  under missile attack. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=197.56s)]
*  According to Israeli media, there have been seven missiles that have gotten through Israel's [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=199.84s)]
*  defense shield. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=204.96s)]
*  We've seen interceptions of the Iron Dome and other anti-missile systems intercepting [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=206.24s)]
*  some of the projectiles, but we also saw at least one get through on video with a big [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=213.08s)]
*  explosion. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=221.32s)]
*  No reports of major injuries or serious injuries. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=222.72s)]
*  Some people heard according to the latest account, but a second wave of missiles is [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=227.0s)]
*  said to be headed toward Israel right now. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=232.84s)]
*  So explain to me what if any kind of response, from what you're hearing on the ground there, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=236.16s)]
*  what if any kind of response Israel has planned in this breaking news situation? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=242.84s)]
*  Well right now they're bracing because they carried out this huge attack on Iran earlier [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=250.0s)]
*  today with 200 warplanes traveling to Iran, which is about a thousand miles away from [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  here where I'm sitting in Jerusalem, and hitting Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=261.56s)]
*  Now those planes have mostly returned to base. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=267.16s)]
*  There are reports of further attacks on another nuclear facility right now, but here in Israel [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=269.6s)]
*  Basically it's defense mode to try and knock these missiles out before they reach Israel. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=278.48s)]
*  I want to bring in Eric Loeb, associate professor at Florida International University with an [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  expertise in Middle East studies. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  Professor, thank you for taking the time to chat with us. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  So what sort of precedent do we have for these strikes? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  Let's contextualize this for our viewers right now. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=299.04s)]
*  Well in terms of direct strikes between Iran and Israel, the precedent that we have has [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=304.36s)]
*  just started since the October 7th Hamas attacks on Israel, and then the subsequent Gaza war [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=309.12s)]
*  since October 7th, 2023. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=316.16s)]
*  Since that time prior to today's attacks, there was an attack by Iran that really surpassed [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=319.16s)]
*  the threshold of directly striking Israel for the first time in its history when it [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=326.72s)]
*  launched drones and missiles of the types that we're seeing today enter Israeli airspace. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=331.44s)]
*  That was back in April of 2024. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=336.32s)]
*  And then again, Iran did that again in October of 2024 as well in response to some of Israeli's [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=339.08s)]
*  actions and activities against Iranian assets in the region. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=346.82s)]
*  And both times Israel retaliated, but not to the level that we saw earlier today. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=351.23999999999995s)]
*  And so we do have this precedent, but a very short precedent, I should say, but we're having [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=358.92s)]
*  increasing escalation by these audacious attacks by Israel that we saw yesterday or earlier [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=364.32s)]
*  today, I should say, and now a larger scale Iranian response that's happening as we speak [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  that follows up an initial response of 100 drones that Iran launched against Israel in [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=378.04s)]
*  the wake of its attack that were largely shot down by Israel and some regional partners [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=383.36s)]
*  like Jordan. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=389.16s)]
*  So Professor, you say that this far overshadows any previous flare ups that we have seen in [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=392.12s)]
*  recent history between these two countries. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=402.52000000000004s)]
*  What's the concern here when it comes to this escalating into a wider conflict? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=407.16s)]
*  Well, the concern is, is that in April and October of 2024, the attacks were very measured, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=412.16s)]
*  we could say limited, even proportional and really focused on military targets and infrastructure [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=424.12s)]
*  sides where we're mainly talking about damage and destruction to facilities and very little [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=431.28s)]
*  collateral damage and carnage to military personnel and to civilians. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=438.52s)]
*  And yesterday or earlier today, we saw Israel cross that threshold by killing and injuring [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=444.52s)]
*  dozens and hundreds of Iranians, both military personnel and civilians as collateral damage [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=451.96s)]
*  that were in these residential areas inside and around these military targets. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=459.26s)]
*  And so the concern is, is whether now Iran's response is also going to be limited to just [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=465.06s)]
*  military targets or whether they themselves are also going to cross that threshold and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=471.28s)]
*  have increased collateral damage and carnage among military and civilians. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=477.18s)]
*  And then whether this continues to escalate into a full blown conflict conflagration, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=482.02s)]
*  that analysts and observers have been warning about since hostilities have increased since October 7th of 2023. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=488.78s)]
*  Professor, we've seen dozens of these missiles being lobbed in this developing situation, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=495.78s)]
*  but break this down for us on a broader context. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=501.41999999999996s)]
*  How many missiles does Iran have or how many are they believed to have in their stockpile? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=504.29999999999995s)]
*  Well, the estimates are unclear. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=512.3s)]
*  We know that, for example, its regional proxy, Hezbollah, had about 100,000 missiles and rockets. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=517.8199999999999s)]
*  And we must assume that Iran's rocket and missile arsenal, both ballistic and cruise missiles, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=524.8199999999999s)]
*  are much larger than that. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=532.8199999999999s)]
*  But it's hard to put an exact number to quantify it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=534.8199999999999s)]
*  What we can say is that in the previous attacks in April and October of 2024, Iran launched [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=538.8199999999999s)]
*  just several hundred missiles, anticipating that most of them would be shot down by the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=546.22s)]
*  Israel Iron Dome system and by other air defense systems along with Israel's allies and partners [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=553.22s)]
*  in the region. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=559.22s)]
*  But now we may see more missiles, even hundreds more being fired by Iran, both cruise, ballistic, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=561.22s)]
*  and drones, with the intention now of overwhelming those systems, if possible, and penetrating [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=569.22s)]
*  Israeli airspace and deliberately now hitting targets. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=575.62s)]
*  Again, we'll have to see if they're military or if they're also expanded to civilian targets. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2c9REfN1Gc&t=579.62s)]
