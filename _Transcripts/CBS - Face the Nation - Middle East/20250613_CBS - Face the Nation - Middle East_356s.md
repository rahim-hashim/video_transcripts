# H.R. McMaster unpacks Israel-Iran conflict
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI)
*  H.R. McMaster, you see on the touch screen, he joins us from Stanford University's Hoover [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=0.0s)]
*  Institution. H.R., thank you so much for joining us. I'm glad you're with us, particularly on this day. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=4.64s)]
*  Two questions. First, evaluate what Israel has done, evaluate the Iranian response such as we know it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=10.24s)]
*  Hey, Major, it's great to be with you. And well, I think what what what Israel's done is actually [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=19.92s)]
*  phenomenal in terms of the performance of Israeli intelligence and the IDF. And Sam nailed it. I [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=26.08s)]
*  mean, this is an operation, I'm sure, that was at least two years in the making to put into place [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=34.56s)]
*  the kind of infrastructure that allowed Israel to just track some of these key leaders in real time, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=39.68s)]
*  leaders who were relevant to the nuclear program and Israel's efforts to set back the nuclear program, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=47.28s)]
*  as well as leaders who were relevant to what Iran might do in response and to cripple that capability. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=53.6s)]
*  In regard to your second question, I think what we have to watch is exactly what you and Sam were [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=64.4s)]
*  discussing, which is, does Iran choose to strike U.S. assets? And as you mentioned, that would be, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=70.8s)]
*  I think, a big risk for them based on the fundamental weakness of the Iranian regime. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=80.16s)]
*  As you and Sam also alluded to, hey, you know, Iran had a pretty good for decades, Major, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=85.6s)]
*  because what they could do is use these proxies and we obliged them kind of by acting like we [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=91.84s)]
*  didn't know what the return address is. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, the theocratic dictator [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  in Iran, he kind of blew it last year when he authorized these direct strikes on Israel and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=103.6s)]
*  Israel responded with a small strike in April and then a massive strike in October of last year, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=109.84s)]
*  taking out their air defense systems, crippling their defense systems, and achieving the kind [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=115.84s)]
*  of freedom of action you saw with, as Sam pointed out, this astounding use, kind of like the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=120.4s)]
*  Ukrainians did in Russia, the use of drones from deep within Iran, as well as the degree to which [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=126.0s)]
*  about 200 Israeli aircraft could fly with relative impunity and strike these large [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=134.64s)]
*  numbers of sites associated with the nuclear program. And the JISM program, I should say. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=141.04s)]
*  H.R., I'm going to have our control room bring up a map for our viewers of where U.S. military [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=146.88s)]
*  forces are positioned in Iraq and Syria. It's roughly 40,000. You're pretty familiar with where [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=151.44s)]
*  they are. Do you consider them at any particular heightened risk right now? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=156.64s)]
*  Yeah, of course they are at a heightened risk. And I think what's really important is you saw [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=160.32s)]
*  the U.S. Department of Defense order those out of the region who aren't really necessary, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=166.72s)]
*  who don't really need to be there from a defense capability. But I should tell you, Major, our air [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=171.04s)]
*  defenses, our missile defenses are a heck of a lot better than they were even five years ago. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  Remember, with the attacks against the Saudi oil fields, the attacks against the Al-Assad air base [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  in 2020 after the killing of Qasem Soleimani, there have been tremendous improvements that you saw [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=189.28s)]
*  in effect in the defeat of the massive Iranian attack on Israel last year. So I think I would [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=197.28s)]
*  be confident in the ability of those forces to defend themselves and in the ability of the U.S. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=204.96s)]
*  military to project power in support of those small bases throughout the region. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=210.88s)]
*  Remember back in 2017 when these Russian mercenaries in the Assad regime, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=218.72s)]
*  you must've been thinking, I wonder what happens when you attack an American outpost? Is that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=224.56s)]
*  actually in early 2018? And everything rained down on them, because what is important to realize [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=229.12s)]
*  about the U.S. military is an integrated air, land, maritime, space, cyberspace capability [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=236.0s)]
*  that the United States can bring to bear. I'm also going to have the control room bring up a map that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  shows where our naval assets are positioned. USS Carl Vinson, that's a carrier strike force [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  in the Arabian Sea. Two destroyers in the Eastern Mediterranean, three other destroyers, two in the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=256.16s)]
*  Red Sea, one in the Western Mediterranean. What do those assets mean and how do they posture us [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=262.32s)]
*  in case this thing gets even wider? Well, they're in a position to impose severe costs on Iran. If [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=268.64s)]
*  Iran does act against us, if they do try to fire the missiles and drones that they have left, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  they're in a position not only with some of our advanced aircraft and radar systems to shoot down [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=283.84s)]
*  those missiles and aircraft as part of an integrated air defense effort, but also to be able to kill [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=288.88s)]
*  the archer that's firing those kind of arrows at our forces. But also what's important to realize [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=294.96s)]
*  so far, Major, is what hasn't been struck in Iran. What hasn't been struck are economic targets. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=302.08s)]
*  I think that was smart by the Israelis in the beginning, because Prime Minister Netanyahu's [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  message to the Iranian people are, hey, look at what this theocratic dictatorship is doing to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=313.2s)]
*  your country and the resources that they have squandered in their efforts to extend hegemonic [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=318.24s)]
*  influence in the region, to attack you as forces, drive us out of the region and destroy Israel. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=324.48s)]
*  What he did in that speech that he made is lay out an alternative path for the Iranian people. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=330.0s)]
*  So I think in the near term, at least, it was smart not to strike targets that could worsen [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=336.56s)]
*  the plight of the Iranian people, many of whom are destitute because of the corruption of this [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=341.68s)]
*  regime in Tehran. H.R. McMaster, I want you to please stay with us. You'll be with us on the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=349.04s)]
*  other side of the break. We'll chat more when we come back. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXDiJyRyWI&t=354.24s)]
