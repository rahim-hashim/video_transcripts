*  When we reached Tehran, we found the city slowly coming back to life. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=26.08s)]
*  With the ceasefire appearing to hold, some had started to venture out. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=30.72s)]
*  And after days of silence, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei spoke in a taped address, where he lashed [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=35.879999999999995s)]

*  Fatima Mohajrani is the Iranian government's spokeswoman, who told us President Trump's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  decision to bomb three of Iran's nuclear facilities was a mistake. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=55.0s)]
*  What happened was a bullet to diplomacy, she said, but from the point of view of Iran, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=60.56s)]
*  diplomacy has no end. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=65.64s)]
*  At Friday prayers, the truest believers in the Islamic Republic. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=70.36s)]
*  Here in theocratic Iran, religion and politics don't just go hand in hand. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  They're inseparable from each other. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=79.84s)]
*  And as expected, you can hear chants of death to America and death to Israel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=82.24000000000001s)]

*  She said, hands off Iran, Trump. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=96.0s)]
*  This is not your homeland. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=98.68s)]
*  Our next stop was to a well-to-do neighborhood in Tehran, where the scars of war were clear [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=101.64s)]
*  to see. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=106.96000000000001s)]

*  of top military commanders, nuclear scientists and women and children killed in Israeli attacks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=113.96s)]
*  What's really been striking at this demonstration is, yes, there are many people here who are [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=121.0s)]
*  very supportive of the Iranian leadership. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=127.0s)]
*  But we've met people from across the political spectrum who share in their anger and in [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  their grief. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_UG_YxaM-I&t=135.0s)]
