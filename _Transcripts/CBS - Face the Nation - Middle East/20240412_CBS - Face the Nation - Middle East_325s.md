# Major Iranian attack against Israel could happen soon, U.S. officials say
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4)
*  Let's begin this morning with U.S. officials that are telling CBS News that a major Iranian attack aimed at military targets in Israel could happen as soon as today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=0.0s)]
*  It could involve more than 100 drones as well as dozens of cruise missiles and potentially ballistic missiles. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=8.0s)]
*  The U.S. has urged Americans in Israel to restrict their movements ahead of a possible attack, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=14.0s)]
*  which would be retaliation for Israel's deadly bombing of Iran's embassy in Syria early this month. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=19.0s)]
*  Deborah Pata has more on fears of a wider war. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=24.0s)]
*  Israel is braced for the worst-case scenario, the possibility of a direct attack on Israeli soil from Iran in retaliation for the bombing of its embassy in Damascus. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=28.0s)]
*  Whoever harms us, we will harm them, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a military air base. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=41.0s)]
*  We are prepared, both defensively and offensively. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=49.0s)]
*  Former Mossad official and Iran's security expert Sima Shine says this is a dangerous moment for the region. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=53.0s)]
*  Is this the most worried you've been? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=60.0s)]
*  Yes, I think this is the most worried. I think it's on both sides, in Israel and in Iran. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=63.0s)]
*  She says if Iran strikes Israel, it could involve missiles and drones similar to the Iranian attack on a Saudi oil facility in 2019. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=69.0s)]
*  They will try to do it on a military or some military asset. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=79.0s)]
*  The question will be the damage, how many injured people killed, and I think it has the potential for a huge escalation. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=85.0s)]
*  However, she stresses that she still believes neither side wants a regional conflict, and that will be weighing heavily on Iran's mind. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=93.0s)]
*  Shine told us that Iran's major dilemma is how to respond in such a way that the conflict does not escalate further. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=103.0s)]
*  And likewise, Israel, she says, may choose to show restraint and avoid further confrontation. Vlad, Anne-Marie? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=110.0s)]
*  Alright, Deborah, thank you. So for more on this, we are joined by Charles Faint. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=118.0s)]
*  Charles is the chair for the study of special operations and the deputy editorial director for the Modern War Institute at West Point. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=122.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. And so, sort of to make it clear, Iranian proxies have been attacking Israel for a while. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=130.0s)]
*  The concern is that now Iran may overtly step into this. Iran itself may attack Israel itself. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=139.0s)]
*  Can you tell us just how dangerous is this moment in the Middle East? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=148.0s)]
*  Hey, Anne-Marie, thanks for having me on the show to talk about this very important topic. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=152.0s)]
*  So I think this is a very dangerous time, not only for the region, but for the world. Tensions are at extreme high right now. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=155.0s)]
*  The move to strike the embassy annex of the Iranians was an extremely provocative move. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=162.0s)]
*  So I think we can see any number of things happening in the very near future that have an impact that might result in a regional conflagration, if not affect the entire world. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=168.0s)]
*  So when you say any number of things, what might an Iranian attack look like? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=177.0s)]
*  Well, Anne-Marie, I think we could see probably five potential courses of action. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=182.0s)]
*  The first one, of course, there's always the course of action to do nothing and to do nothing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=186.0s)]
*  I don't mean the Iranians pretend that like this never happened. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=190.0s)]
*  But, for example, if there were a ceasefire in Gaza, they might declare victory with that saying that they got what they wanted and are now going to take the higher road. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=193.0s)]
*  I think it's more likely that there will be some type of kinetic action. For example, they might attack Israeli interests abroad. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=202.0s)]
*  We see movement and reporting in the open source press about targeting of Israeli embassies, et cetera, overseas. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=207.0s)]
*  We mentioned the use of proxies that probably continue, especially with Hezbollah up to the north of Israel. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=214.0s)]
*  The most dangerous thing is probably to attack Israel directly, which I expect we will see with drones and rockets and missiles. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=220.0s)]
*  And then, of course, they might also attack the allies or interests worldwide. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=228.0s)]
*  The most dangerous course of action is probably some type of combination of all of those. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=233.0s)]
*  And I think that's what Israel and the world is bracing for the worst. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=237.0s)]
*  And obviously, everyone is also concerned that there could be a miscalculation or a mistake when things are so tense. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=240.0s)]
*  What are the options in terms of de-escalation? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=247.0s)]
*  So it's hard right now to see what de-escalation would look like with the interests of so many powerful states being diametrically opposed. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=250.0s)]
*  For example, Iran is committed to the destruction of Israel. Israel is committed to not being destroyed. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=257.0s)]
*  Our president has made it very clear where the U.S. stands on this. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=263.0s)]
*  So right now, I think we're seeing a rush for cooler heads to prevail in this, to prevent this from coming into a wider conflict that I think most of the major parties at this time don't want. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=267.0s)]
*  Right. And you mentioned President Biden. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=277.0s)]
*  While recently he's been particularly critical of Benjamin Netanyahu, he has also reinforced the fact that U.S. support for Israel is ironclad. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=280.0s)]
*  That is the word that he used. So then what would an Iranian attack mean for the U.S.? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=290.0s)]
*  It would probably mean that the U.S. would create a sanctioned regime to punish the Iranian government again. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=295.0s)]
*  Of course, there'll be a lot of things going on behind the scenes that we're not aware of. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=301.0s)]
*  But the most dangerous thing from America's perspective is probably the indirection of U.S. boots on the ground or U.S. and in Iran getting into direct military conflict. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=305.0s)]
*  All right, Charles, fate, the eyes of the world watching this area of the world. Thank you so much. Thank you, Emory. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYrdWWwsl4&t=317.0s)]
