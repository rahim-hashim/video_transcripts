# Aid begins moving slowly into Gaza after ceasefire takes effect between Israel and Hamas
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU)
*  Well, we're at the Rafa crossing between Egypt and Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=0.0s)]
*  And as you can see, these are among the first aid trucks [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=4.44s)]
*  to go into Gaza now that this ceasefire is in effect. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=7.88s)]
*  And the aid that has been going in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=12.68s)]
*  has been so desperately needed. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=15.8s)]
*  In fact, other trucks are going to start making their way [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=17.92s)]
*  through soon as well. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=21.12s)]
*  And would you consider the fact that so little aid has been [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=22.56s)]
*  making it into Gaza since the start of this war? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=26.64s)]
*  Aid like this, this is sacks of flour [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=31.32s)]
*  that you can see on the back of this truck. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=33.84s)]
*  And we've been hearing from the United Nations [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=36.52s)]
*  who have told us that 90% of people in Gaza [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  are suffering from extreme hunger. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=43.6s)]
*  Aid like this is so desperately needed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=46.8s)]
*  But again, it is moving quite slowly. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  As part of this ceasefire agreement, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=53.92s)]
*  between 500 and 600 trucks are supposed to make it into Gaza [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=56.24s)]
*  on any given day. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  And although this is the first day, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  it has been moving very slowly. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=64.8s)]
*  But this is a very hopeful sign [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=67.2s)]
*  that the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  will hopefully start to improve at least a little bit. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAbZWVuGjU&t=73.44s)]
