# Breaking down why there is renewed hope for a ceasefire in Gaza
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ)
*  There is fresh optimism in the Middle East that a ceasefire in Gaza is closer than ever. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=0.0s)]
*  CIA Director William Burns arrived in Qatar Wednesday as negotiators pushed for a breakthrough [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  to end the 14-month conflict. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=10.24s)]
*  But even with talks underway, the fighting continues. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=12.72s)]
*  Palestinian health officials say multiple Israeli airstrikes killed at least 20 people [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=15.48s)]
*  across Gaza Wednesday. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=19.88s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Chris Levsay reports from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=21.8s)]
*  Well, for the first time in a long time, there is renewed optimism that a deal could finally [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=25.439999999999998s)]
*  be reached for a ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  John Kirby, the White House spokesman, says they are cautiously optimistic in Washington [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=36.12s)]
*  that a deal could be reached. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  Also, a Hamas source tells The Washington Post that Hamas is giving up its demand for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  the IDF, that's the Israeli military, to end the war first and to completely pull out of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=48.08s)]
*  the strip. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=54.64s)]
*  And in Israel, the defense minister said that this is the closest they've been since the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=55.64s)]
*  last deal more than a year ago, which led to the release of more than 100 hostages. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=59.84s)]
*  Now, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under a lot of pressures, namely from incoming [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=66.24s)]
*  President Donald Trump, who has said repeatedly that there will be, quote, held to pay if [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=73.48s)]
*  the hostages aren't released before he comes into office. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=79.56s)]
*  There are 80 percent of Israelis here in the country who say that they are also in favor [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=83.72000000000001s)]
*  of some kind of a deal to end the war in exchange for those hostages. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=88.92s)]
*  So the domestic pressures in Israel are also quite intense. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=94.12s)]
*  And now also, for the first time in a long time, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=97.64000000000001s)]
*  enough support within his coalition to survive members of that coalition leaving in protest [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=102.04s)]
*  over a ceasefire deal. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=109.12s)]
*  It's been the threat for many, many months that some of these more hardline members of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=111.56s)]
*  his coalition who were against a deal to end the war would walk out, and that could topple [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=115.4s)]
*  his government. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=121.4s)]
*  But now Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has the support to survive that kind of a [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=122.4s)]
*  thing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=127.72s)]
*  And so for the first time, we're seeing more and more hope that a deal could come through. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=128.72s)]
*  That said, we also spoke to family members of the hostages. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=132.68s)]
*  We spoke to the father of two of those hostages who have been held for more than a year now. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  We asked him if he's optimistic, and he told us he's had his heart broken so many times [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=143.0s)]
*  in the past that he won't believe it until he sees it with his own eyes, until he sees [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=149.44s)]
*  his two boys walking across the border with Gaza and into Israel. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=154.22s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=159.88s)]
*  Chris, let's say thank you. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=160.88s)]
*  John Alterman joins us now. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=162.0s)]
*  He's a senior vice president and director of the Middle East program at the Center for [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=163.52s)]
*  Strategic and International Studies. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=166.84s)]
*  So John, it's been more than six months since President Biden announced that ceasefire framework [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=169.36s)]
*  in late May. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=173.66s)]
*  That proposal never came to fruition. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=174.76s)]
*  What is different this time? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=176.68s)]
*  It feels like the Hamas position has moved significantly. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=179.12s)]
*  Certainly there's a different Hamas leadership because the previous Hamas leadership was [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=183.32s)]
*  killed. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=187.72s)]
*  I think the Israelis are a little more interested than they had been. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=188.72s)]
*  And so there seems to be some signs of optimism. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=193.72s)]
*  The interesting thing is right now there's more optimism coming from the Hamas side and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=197.88s)]
*  the Israeli side is pouring a little bit of cold water on it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=203.96s)]
*  But we're seeing steps that look like serious efforts to figure out how many hostages are [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=206.66s)]
*  alive, who's actually holding them, what would lists look like of people being exchanged. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=214.24s)]
*  This is the prelude to possibly getting an actual deal. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=219.98s)]
*  The New York Times reports Hamas may be willing to let Israel maintain a military presence [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=224.06s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=228.38s)]
*  How big of a concession would that be for Hamas and why might the group be taking this [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=229.38s)]
*  new stance? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=233.14s)]
*  Well, we'll see exactly what it means. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=234.14s)]
*  What I understood is there's some willingness for a temporary military presence, how that's [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=237.01999999999998s)]
*  phrased what's understood by it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=241.73999999999998s)]
*  I mean, there might be a little bit of wiggle room, but certainly there has been polling [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=244.22s)]
*  coming out of Gaza since September suggesting that Gazans are just exhausted. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=248.46s)]
*  They just want an end to the violence. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=254.5s)]
*  There may be a public opinion reason why Hamas has softened its position in addition to the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=257.14s)]
*  fact that, as I said, the hardline leadership, Yahya Sinwar in particular, is now dead. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=264.58s)]
*  If the Biden administration can move this across the finish line, what would that mean [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=269.90000000000003s)]
*  for the president's legacy and what role would the incoming Trump administration play in [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=273.3s)]
*  trying to maintain the ceasefire? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=277.5s)]
*  You know, in some ways, I think both the Trump administration and the Biden administration [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=279.78s)]
*  would take credit. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=283.38s)]
*  As your package suggested, President Trump and President-elect Trump said that if the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=284.38s)]
*  hostages are still there when he takes office, there will be hell to pay so he can take credit. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=289.5s)]
*  And certainly his envoys have been in the region trying to move things forward. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=293.97999999999996s)]
*  In addition to President Biden's envoys, I think from from President Biden's perspective, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=298.41999999999996s)]
*  he would say, this is what I've been trying to do all along. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=303.74s)]
*  We were finally successful. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=306.70000000000005s)]
*  And President Trump and his team would say what made it work was the fact that President [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=308.38000000000005s)]
*  Trump was coming into office and people said, we have to make this deal. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=314.90000000000003s)]
*  John Ultraman, thank you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=318.90000000000003s)]
*  Thank you, Lindsay. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=320.70000000000005s)]
*  Always good to see you. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=321.3s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RgC988N3uQ&t=321.94000000000005s)]
