# White House unsatisfied with flow of aid into Gaza, adviser says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was on Capitol Hill today where he urged international [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=2.84s)]
*  partners to quote, do everything they can, unquote, to expedite aid deliveries into Gaza. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=6.88s)]
*  CBS News Chief Foreign Affairs correspondent and the moderator of Face the Nation, Margaret [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=12.72s)]
*  Brennan joins me here on the set. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=16.94s)]
*  Great to see you, Margaret. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=20.0s)]
*  I want to talk to you also about something that the National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=21.0s)]
*  said at the White House briefing today, emphasizing the administration's push to increase the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=24.6s)]
*  flow and the reliability of the flow of aid into Gaza. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=33.68s)]
*  Aid is flowing. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=35.26s)]
*  It is not flowing at the rate that any of us would be happy with because we always want [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=36.52s)]
*  more, but we are actually seeing good cooperation between the U.S., the IDF, the UN, and other [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  humanitarian organizations to ensure that aid goes from that peer to innocent people [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=47.08s)]
*  in need and we'll continue to do that as we go forward. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=52.72s)]
*  Margaret, status check. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=56.040000000000006s)]
*  Where are we on this? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  Flowing might be generous. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=58.540000000000006s)]
*  Because over the weekend, as you know, the World Food Program, which is overseeing the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=60.22s)]
*  delivery from the peer to the actual distribution to the people, actually had to shut down some [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=64.66s)]
*  of the distribution because they had trucks raided by starving people, by also perhaps [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=71.1s)]
*  criminal elements mixed in there. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=76.98s)]
*  But this issue of delivery has been the most central and most difficult thing when it comes [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=79.06s)]
*  to aid for weeks. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=84.98s)]
*  And it has been one of the hardest parts of this to negotiate. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=88.06s)]
*  But to be clear, backing this up to the question of the peer that the U.S. is defending from [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=90.34s)]
*  the White House podium, it is inefficient, it is insufficient to need. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=94.58s)]
*  There's only something like seven trucks worth of aid delivered off of a peer. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=99.82000000000001s)]
*  It is far more efficient to have the flow through those land gates with additional deliveries. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=104.54s)]
*  Far more efficient also than dropping things from the sky. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=110.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=113.78s)]
*  What is the status of those land delivery areas which the Israelis, for various reasons, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=114.78s)]
*  and they have changed the justification over time, continue to either lock, intercept, or slow? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=120.78s)]
*  Well, Jake Sullivan said today that there were 695 metric tons of food being delivered. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=126.78s)]
*  I think those were off the peer going to a warehouse. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=132.54s)]
*  And then it's the, okay, and then. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=134.74s)]
*  And then what? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  And then what? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=137.42000000000002s)]
*  But for those land entries, what we know is that at this moment in time, particularly [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=138.42000000000002s)]
*  since that IDF encirclement of Rafa in southern Gaza, those gateways that had been opened [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=142.78s)]
*  following President Biden's pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu then were closed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=151.1s)]
*  And that is not just the Israeli issue. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=155.94s)]
*  That's also an Egyptian issue and somewhat of a Palestinian issue. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=158.7s)]
*  And you heard Secretary Blinken get pressed on this today before Congress when he was [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  testifying. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=164.5s)]
*  And he very diplomatically said, well, the Egyptians are being great partners, but it [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=165.9s)]
*  would be great if they could do more. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=169.58s)]
*  Some of what they were closing off on their side of the border was due to their frustration [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=171.38s)]
*  that the Israeli government sent its troops into Rafa. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=177.1s)]
*  So they were protesting it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=180.34s)]
*  And from aid workers that I've talked to, they said, fine, protest it, but don't deny [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=181.5s)]
*  starving people food. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  On the IDF part of it, some of it is also just the logistics of moving people, aid workers, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=186.9s)]
*  through areas that are contested. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=193.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=195.62s)]
*  A combat zone. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=196.62s)]
*  A combat zone. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=197.62s)]
*  And you put IDF soldiers in there. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=198.62s)]
*  You are going to also draw in Hamas fighters shooting at them and vice versa. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=199.78s)]
*  So if you have to put in noncombatants in the midst of that, it's also highly dangerous. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=203.74s)]
*  So this is a really complicated operation. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=208.7s)]
*  And there is day to day pressure being brought by the Biden administration. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=211.62s)]
*  But this brings you to those bigger debates and conversations about whether there's deliberate [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=216.14s)]
*  withholding of aid, whether there has been, you know, at the government levels higher [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=220.82s)]
*  than the folks on the ground, decisions to make it more difficult. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=226.02s)]
*  And we've seen explicit statements from some Israeli government ministers. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=230.74s)]
*  When pressed on this very question on CNN yesterday by Jake Tapper, the Israeli Prime [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=234.58s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, well, we deliver aid. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=239.58s)]
*  We're very much in favor of that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=242.66000000000003s)]
*  But Hamas steals it or siphons it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=244.22000000000003s)]
*  I'm sure that is in some respects true. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=247.82000000000002s)]
*  Is it totally the story? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=251.34s)]
*  What is our visibility on that key question? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=254.06s)]
*  Well, the Israeli prime minister has said throughout that there is no obstruction on [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=256.1s)]
*  his government's part. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=260.06s)]
*  However, if that were true, then he would not have taken power away from the ministers [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=261.42s)]
*  who were controlling aid access, some of them the more far right nationalist ministers within [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=266.58s)]
*  his government, Smotrik and Ben Gavir. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=272.12s)]
*  They were blocking at one point delivery of U.S. taxpayer funded flour. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=274.66s)]
*  So one of the things that happened after that phone call, President Biden made that, as [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=278.72s)]
*  we all know, was very heavily publicized as a tough one. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=282.34s)]
*  A few weeks ago, Prime Minister Netanyahu took control from those ministers and said he would [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=285.9s)]
*  now play a direct role in overseeing aid operations. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=292.58s)]
*  So if it was all fine and dandy, then come on. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=295.46s)]
*  So and you wouldn't have a famine in northern Gaza to the degree that you do now. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=297.9s)]
*  Now, does that mean there aren't criminal elements? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=302.53999999999996s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=306.34s)]
*  And U.S. officials have said that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=307.34s)]
*  It's not just Hamas. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=308.46s)]
*  There are also criminal elements. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=309.46s)]
*  You also have crowds of starving people. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=310.94s)]
*  There's a lot of exploitation that is happening there. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=313.58s)]
*  And the scarcity only makes it more of a profit making incentive for some of these criminal [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=316.5s)]
*  enterprises to take food. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=320.7s)]
*  And very briefly, Margaret, the Israeli prime minister also talking to CNN sort of downplayed [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=322.42s)]
*  the idea of starvation or famine, like it's not really a real thing. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=327.14s)]
*  What do we know? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=330.74s)]
*  It's a real thing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=331.74s)]
*  And we have had numerous people tell us some of the most horrific detail on our program [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=332.92s)]
*  on Face the Nation, whether it was the head of Doctors Without Borders, the head of Save [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=338.70000000000005s)]
*  the Children, the head of UNICEF. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=342.14000000000004s)]
*  We have talked to people on the ground, the Scott Peterson, who runs UNRWA, a U.S. Army [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=344.98s)]
*  vet who is on the ground there saying that they do not have food and water to meet the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=350.94000000000005s)]
*  number of people they have. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=357.48s)]
*  I have spoken to people who have left Gaza, who have told me that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=359.06s)]
*  And you are seeing that also, by the way, if you want to read the State Department report [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=363.90000000000003s)]
*  that was published under this national security memorandum that the president ordered, it [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=368.21999999999997s)]
*  detailed how severe the humanitarian deprivation had gotten. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=372.7s)]
*  It also, by the way, mentioned ongoing Israeli court system investigations into criminal [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=377.26s)]
*  undertakings within the Israeli system. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=383.36s)]
*  Margaret Brennan, as always, thank you so much for your expertise and perspective. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l2rIPdCnQ&t=385.7s)]
