# Humanitarian crisis in Gaza is "unspeakable," Save the Children CEO Janti Soeripto says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [December 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY)
*  We want to return to the Gaza humanitarian crisis and the devastating impact on its residents, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=0.0s)]
*  particularly children. Joining us is the president and CEO of Save the Children U.S., [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=4.88s)]
*  Yanti Serypto. Good to have you here. Thank you for having me, Margaret. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=9.92s)]
*  In person. We knew half of the residents of Gaza before the war were children. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=13.52s)]
*  For those who have survived the war to date, what is life like for them? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=18.88s)]
*  It's an unbelievable humanitarian catastrophe, Margaret. We have no access to basic services. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=23.36s)]
*  There is an absence of clean water. We saw in the earlier segment children drinking dirty water [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=29.2s)]
*  from a pipe on the ground. The rainy season has started. There is sewage in the streets. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=34.72s)]
*  There is no food. There is no electricity. Most of the hospitals are not functioning anymore. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=41.6s)]
*  There is no electricity. It is unspeakable essentially what's unfolding before our eyes. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=47.04s)]
*  Humanitarian agencies cannot help the population of Gaza and those children in the current situation. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=54.16s)]
*  Cannot help them. Why? Is that because there is only this one open gate at present to allow [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=60.64s)]
*  aid in and Israel screening at all? That is one of the issues as well. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=67.28s)]
*  When the humanitarian pause happened a few days ago, for seven days, those seven days were not [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=74.0s)]
*  enough. You cannot really rebuild a warehouse in seven days. But there was aid coming in. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=78.4s)]
*  We could even deliver some of those supplies even without fuel, the necessary fuel to get [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=83.44s)]
*  stuff all the way up to the north. But currently with all this violence, the attacks, the shelling, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=89.84s)]
*  we cannot go out and deliver safely. We also cannot ask families and children to come out [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=96.88s)]
*  and receive those deliveries because that is not safe either. People are putting up tents [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=102.8s)]
*  in the middle of the road because that's the only way to get shelter currently. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=107.52s)]
*  You know, I think any parent seeing images of a child in pain or suffering, it is just so hard [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=112.64s)]
*  to stomach. But the other statistic that I saw from the UN was that 180 women give birth each [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=118.16s)]
*  day in Gaza. And UNICEF said 105,000 breastfeeding mothers are struggling to even feed themselves. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=124.72s)]
*  If you aren't getting a newborn baby food in those first six months, you are setting them up [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=132.24s)]
*  for a horrible life. So what is happening to that next generation? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=137.76s)]
*  Well, exactly right. We see, you know, mothers can't feed their children. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  Mothers are giving birth in overcrowded shelters. They're having c-sections without anesthesia. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=148.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, we've got premature babies in incubators that cannot run because there's no [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  electricity. No, it is absolutely horrific what has happened to this generation of children. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=158.0s)]
*  And we know that if they don't get the food and the necessary supplies that they need, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=163.2s)]
*  certainly in those first months of life, that is already setting them behind. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=167.04s)]
*  The US vetoed that ceasefire call at the United Nations. And afterwards, your organization released [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=173.76s)]
*  a statement said, Israel is forcing civilians into so-called safe zones that cannot accommodate [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=179.68s)]
*  them and quote, deliberately depriving the civilian population of food, water and fuel, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=185.44s)]
*  willfully impeding relief supplies and using starvation as a method of warfare. That is [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=191.44s)]
*  a very strong allegation in that press release yesterday. Why do you say this is deliberate? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=196.88s)]
*  There is, I mean, look, humanitarian organizations like ours, we're really running out of words to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=206.24s)]
*  describe how bad it is. We work in crisis all over the world, from Afghanistan to Sudan, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=211.44s)]
*  to Ethiopia, to the Democratic Republic of Congo. So we are no strangers to war and conflict. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=217.04s)]
*  But what is happening here is that there is, there's two million people, a million children [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=222.24s)]
*  in a very, very small space. There is no way to get out. Nobody can flee, which is not the case [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=227.84s)]
*  in most of these other crises. And there is nothing coming in. And there's an absence of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=234.56s)]
*  basic necessities. So the siege that's put upon the people of Gaza is not, A, we cannot do it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=240.4s)]
*  There is no market of sorts to allow people to get access to food and water and anything they need. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=248.4s)]
*  So we think that is a willful, you know. It's a choice. It's a choice. It's a choice. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=253.6s)]
*  And it's withholding aid from the population. The United States, the president himself has been on [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=261.6s)]
*  the phone pressing for aid to flow in more. There are other ways to get into Gaza. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  Israel controls those gates. Have they opened yet? Because the White House said they were about to. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=273.28s)]
*  We haven't heard anything of that effect. The Ra'aqa crossing is open. It was never set up to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  allow for that capacity of aid that is required. Also, we haven't seen even those 100, 150 trucks, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=283.52s)]
*  200 trucks come across the Ra'aqa crossing over the past couple of days after the ending of the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=291.12s)]
*  pause. So we are continually calling for Kerem Shalom to also open to allow for more to come in [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  if and when the fighting stops. Will you stay working in Gaza? Can you? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  We will. We have been there since 1953. We are not leaving now. We have 25 staff there. We won't [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=309.12s)]
*  leave. But at the moment, working for us in a safe and quality way is impossible. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=316.0s)]
*  Thank you for sharing that story of what's happening inside. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0zPI8IYcY&t=322.16s)]
