# Blinken says "gaps are narrowing" in Israel-Hamas cease-fire talks
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [March 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc)
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken says officials are closer to brokering a ceasefire and hostage [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=0.0s)]
*  release deal between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Blinken is meeting with Arab leaders in Egypt today following his trip to Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=8.44s)]
*  He will also travel to Israel tomorrow. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=13.26s)]
*  Blinken says while quote, gaps are narrowing, differences remain between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=15.68s)]
*  BBC News correspondent Mark Lohan joins us now from Jerusalem. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=21.28s)]
*  Mark, what are some of the sticking points that need to be resolved at this stage? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Hi there. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=29.64s)]
*  Well, there is just frankly a lot of bad blood, of course, between the two warring sides and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=30.64s)]
*  a chasm of mistrust over these five and a half months of war and actually far longer, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=34.64s)]
*  of course, than that dating back to Hamas' takeover of Gaza back in 2006. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  So what we understand on the table is a deal in which there would be a ceasefire for about [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=44.2s)]
*  six weeks. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=50.36s)]
*  There would be a release of around about 40 Israeli hostages in return for hundreds of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=51.36s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners being released from Israeli jails. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=56.72s)]
*  The identity of the Palestinian prisoners is one sticking point with the Palestinians [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=60.28s)]
*  thought to be pushing for quite high level prisoners to be released from Israeli jails, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=64.92s)]
*  not just low level criminals but people who are accused of facing sentences of murder [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=69.0s)]
*  and attempted assassination. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=75.4s)]
*  So that will be one sticking point. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=77.52s)]
*  The length of the ceasefire, exactly which hostages would be released would be another [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=78.88s)]
*  sticking point. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=82.44s)]
*  And frankly, we have been here time and time again over the last few weeks where we thought [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=83.48s)]
*  that a ceasefire was in the offing only for it to collapse at the last minute. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=88.48s)]
*  So even though Anthony Blinken has said that the gaps are narrowing, I think nobody is [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=91.96s)]
*  holding their breath at the moment for an imminent breakthrough. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=95.56s)]
*  And Mark, the Israeli government also says it's working on an evacuation plan for civilians [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  in the southern Gaza city of Ra'afa. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=103.32s)]
*  What do you know about this plan and a potential timeline for the offensive into Ra'afa? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=105.8s)]
*  Well, Lana, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, has said that an Israeli incursion [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=113.64s)]
*  into Ra'afa would take some time to achieve. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=117.28s)]
*  And yet he said that he is determined to push on with that and that he has approved the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=120.08s)]
*  operational plan for the invasion, saying that it is the only way of destroying Hamas [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=123.84s)]
*  battalions and achieving what he calls total victory. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=128.68s)]
*  It is the last part of Gaza in which the Israeli ground troops have not been sent. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=134.12s)]
*  Now the huge worry is that about one and a half million civilians are sheltering there, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=139.04s)]
*  more than half the entire population of Gaza. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=143.6s)]
*  And a range of Israel's international allies at the forefront, the U.S., have warned against [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=146.16s)]
*  an Israeli incursion. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=152.16s)]
*  Joe Biden spoke to Benjamin Netanyahu at their first conversation in a very difficult, acrimonious [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=153.44s)]
*  relationship in more than a month a couple of days ago and said it would be a mistake [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=158.04s)]
*  for Israel to send the army in there and has summoned an Israeli delegation to the U.S. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=162.0s)]
*  to explain a proper evacuation plan. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=167.34s)]
*  I think it would take a long time or potentially quite a long time and manpower to move those [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=170.54s)]
*  kinds of numbers away from Ra'afa in terms of the civilian evacuations before the Israeli [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=175.22s)]
*  army goes in. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=178.94s)]
*  So, once again, we're not expecting this to happen in the next few days. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=179.94s)]
*  It could be a few weeks before Israel pushes in there, if indeed it does. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=183.06s)]
*  So many complicated pieces to this, Mark. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=186.66s)]
*  And in addition, Israel's raid, I understand, on Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital is now in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=188.78s)]
*  its fourth day. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=193.9s)]
*  How does that contribute to this? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=195.3s)]
*  Yeah, the Israeli military says that they have killed another 50 Hamas terrorists in [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=198.26000000000002s)]
*  their words in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of Hamas gunmen killed in Al-Shifa [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=203.86s)]
*  to 140 since the raid was launched three days ago. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=209.86s)]
*  Remember, Al-Shifa is Gaza's largest hospital. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=214.02s)]
*  It was raided by the Israeli military back in November, who stormed the hospital, accusing [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=217.74s)]
*  it of being a Hamas command center and then posting pictures and videos that purportedly [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=221.86s)]
*  showed tunnels underneath the hospital and weapons stored inside, which the Israeli military [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=226.46s)]
*  said justified their claim that Hamas was using medical facilities to attack Israel. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=233.22s)]
*  Hamas has always denied that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=238.42s)]
*  The fact that the Israeli military have now gone back into Al-Shifa suggests that Hamas [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=240.34s)]
*  is regrouping in the north, and that will be bad news for the Israeli military, suggests [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=245.9s)]
*  that the military campaign is not necessarily going according to plan. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=249.85999999999999s)]
*  And the Israeli military say that they have killed a senior member of Hamas's internal [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=254.54000000000002s)]
*  security inside Al-Shifa. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=259.62s)]
*  We understand that the fighting is still ongoing there and that the general area has not yet [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=261.98s)]
*  been brought under complete control. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=266.46000000000004s)]
*  All right, Mark Lohan, bringing us the latest from Jerusalem. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=267.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzWo93ioHc&t=270.86s)]
