Video Description: Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, tells "Face the Nation" that in the wake of the deadly rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, the shipments of weapons to Israel have been "delayed intentionally." "We signed off on these weapons, and for some reason the administration has withheld those weapons — tactic or maybe it gives them leverage," McCaul said.

# GOP Rep. Michael McCaul says Biden administration delaying weapons to Israel for "leverage"
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4)
*  We're now joined by the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Michael McCaul. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=0.0s)]
*  Chairman, thanks for being here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=4.0s)]
*  Thanks, Robert. Thanks for having me. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=6.0s)]
*  Pretty grim morning over in Israel in the fallout from the Golan Heights strikes. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=8.0s)]
*  Secretary Blinken told reporters this morning, quote, every indication is that indeed the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=12.0s)]
*  rockets were from or in some way related to Hezbollah. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=16.0s)]
*  A U.S. official also tells CBS News there's no real doubt this was Hezbollah. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=20.0s)]
*  Have you been briefed on the situation in the Golan Heights, and what can you tell us? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=24.0s)]
*  Well, we have, and it did come from Hezbollah within the five-mile range that the UN Security Council [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=28.0s)]
*  resolution says that Hezbollah cannot operate within this five-mile zone, killing 12 children on a playground. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=33.0s)]
*  And essentially, they're Arab Druze, a religious minority sect. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=43.0s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense to me why they would target those people, and now they're claiming they had nothing to do with it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=49.0s)]
*  Perhaps that may be why. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=54.0s)]
*  So for someone who's just kind of tuning into this issue, they hear about Israel's war with Hamas, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=56.0s)]
*  and they now hear about Hezbollah attacking in the Golan Heights. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=61.0s)]
*  And you just heard Senator Lindsey Graham on Face the Nation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=65.0s)]
*  He warned of possible nuclear concerns here if this spills and spirals into a broader conflict. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=67.0s)]
*  What's the big picture here of the threat of this situation exacerbating in the coming days and weeks? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=73.0s)]
*  Well, we don't want escalation, for sure. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=79.0s)]
*  I think it's important to note that Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthi rebels are all proxies of Iran. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=82.0s)]
*  They're sort of like the tentacles of the head of the snake, if you will. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=88.0s)]
*  And so they don't operate without Iran's consent. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=91.0s)]
*  And so what I think is happening, to be honest with you, as they debate the ceasefire, Iran doesn't want normalization. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=97.0s)]
*  And that is the process with Saudi Arabia and Israel that they were entering into prior to October the 7th. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=106.0s)]
*  This is a very important point. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=113.0s)]
*  Once Iran saw this, I think that culminated in October the 7th. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=115.0s)]
*  So it's not in their interest to have any ceasefire agreement that would somehow keep... [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=120.0s)]
*  They want Sinwar to stay in power. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=128.0s)]
*  They want Hamas to stay in power. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=130.0s)]
*  Otherwise, they lose power. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=132.0s)]
*  And the Saudis have made it clear to get to the normalization peace process. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=134.0s)]
*  Sinwar has to go. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=138.0s)]
*  Hamas has to go. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=139.0s)]
*  And we need a new form of governance for the Palestinian people. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=140.0s)]
*  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the United States this past week, what have you heard, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=144.0s)]
*  what have you been told about his request to have more shipments of weapons delivered on a fast-track basis? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=149.0s)]
*  Well, I sign off on all four military sales. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=156.0s)]
*  And I sign off on all the ones that have gone to Israel and also to Ukraine and Taiwan. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=159.0s)]
*  And so the fact is, though, that these shipments have been delayed intentionally. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=164.0s)]
*  Now, the Four Corners, that being the chair and ranking member of House Foreign Affairs and Senate Relations, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=169.0s)]
*  we signed off on these weapons. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=174.0s)]
*  And for some reason, the administration has withheld those weapons. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=176.0s)]
*  What's the reason? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=179.0s)]
*  I think maybe it gives them leverage over Israel and decision-making processes. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=180.0s)]
*  But when I talk to the prime minister in his office, this creates daylight between the United States and Israel. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=186.0s)]
*  And I think it's very dangerous, especially right now, for us to somehow put daylight between us [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=192.0s)]
*  and our most important U.S. ally, the democracy in the Middle East. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=198.0s)]
*  Let's turn to the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=203.0s)]
*  What is the role going to be you have going forward in a possible task force to investigate this assassination attempt? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=208.0s)]
*  Have you spoken with Speaker Johnson about having some kind of role? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=215.0s)]
*  Because not only you focus on foreign policy, but also on homeland security. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=218.0s)]
*  What do you want to do and what should happen now? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=222.0s)]
*  What I want to see is sort of like how I've conducted the Afghanistan investigation [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=225.0s)]
*  that we're starting to wind up with a report on the anniversary of the Abbey Gate bombing. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=229.0s)]
*  Professional. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=234.0s)]
*  Now, professionalism is a very important experience. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=235.0s)]
*  So you want people that either have special operators that know how snipers work [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=238.0s)]
*  to federal prosecutors like myself that know how the process works. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=244.0s)]
*  I conducted national security events when I led the Joint Terrorism Task Forces. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=248.0s)]
*  So I want it to be an experience, but also done very professionally without a lot of theater, if you will. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=253.0s)]
*  I think you want to be credible more than anything. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=259.0s)]
*  Will you be on it? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=262.0s)]
*  It deserves that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=263.0s)]
*  Will you be on the task force? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=264.0s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=265.0s)]
*  Would you be willing to? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=266.0s)]
*  If asked, I would serve. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=267.0s)]
*  But there are a lot of other very qualified people. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=268.0s)]
*  Is it feasible to get a report done on the assassination attempt by the end of this year? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=271.0s)]
*  I think so. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=275.0s)]
*  I went out to the site. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=276.0s)]
*  I went up to the rooftop. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=277.0s)]
*  This individual should never have been that close to the president of the United States. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=279.0s)]
*  It was very, very close. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=282.0s)]
*  And the fact he even got there in the first place was a failure. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=284.0s)]
*  It should have been stopped. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=288.0s)]
*  What's interesting, Robert, is that he had a detonation device on him and two bombs in the car. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=289.0s)]
*  What his plan was was to assassinate the president, create a diversion by blowing up his [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=294.0s)]
*  vehicle on the other side of the property, and then he could escape. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=299.0s)]
*  Do you have confidence in the Secret Service to protect former President Trump and to protect [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=303.0s)]
*  President Biden and other protectees at this point? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=308.0s)]
*  Yes, the director has just recently resigned. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=311.0s)]
*  But former President Trump's going back to Pennsylvania for rallies. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=314.0s)]
*  The Secret Service is still with him. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=317.0s)]
*  Do you have confidence in the Secret Service at this time? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=319.0s)]
*  You know, I chaired Homeland for three terms and I have faith and confidence in them. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=321.0s)]
*  I didn't have confidence in their leadership. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=326.0s)]
*  And I'm glad that Director Cheadle did the right thing and resigned like President Reagan's [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=329.0s)]
*  Director of Secret Service did. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=333.0s)]
*  Anytime you have an attempted assassination, that is a failure. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=335.0s)]
*  And she said that herself. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=338.0s)]
*  I think the agents are good. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=340.0s)]
*  I think the problem is, you know, the president is under a lot of threats, obviously, and one [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=341.0s)]
*  from Iran as well. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=346.0s)]
*  They asked for additional agents. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=348.0s)]
*  They were not given that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=349.0s)]
*  So it was a leadership. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=351.0s)]
*  Should the U.S. step in, in your view, and provide more resources, more agents? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=352.0s)]
*  Is there a congressional role in addressing the Secret Service issue? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=356.0s)]
*  Be happy to do that, but I think for the most part they have the resources. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=359.0s)]
*  It's just, at this particular event and the Trump campaign itself, they were derelict in their responsibilities. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=363.0s)]
*  When you look at foreign policy, you also have issues with the border. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=370.0s)]
*  What's your assessment of where things stand with U.S. border policy and the national security threats there, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=375.0s)]
*  especially with this mounting number of arrests at the border in recent weeks? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=379.0s)]
*  Well, in addition to the aggravated felons and the fentanyls, and I can go on and on about that, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=383.0s)]
*  what I worry most about, Robert, is, look, you had the fall of Afghanistan. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=387.0s)]
*  Thousands of ISIS-K came out of those prisons of Bagram, end up in a region called the Khorazan region, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=392.0s)]
*  which is Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=398.0s)]
*  They make their way over. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=401.0s)]
*  They come through Mexico, and they enter into the United States. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=403.0s)]
*  ISIS. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=406.0s)]
*  When I chaired Homeland, we worried about this, but we never actually saw it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=407.0s)]
*  Now we have ISIS in the homeland. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=410.0s)]
*  Fortunately, the FBI has detained the eight individuals, but the question is, how many more are here? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=413.0s)]
*  Chairman McCaul of Texas, thank you for stopping by Face the Nation. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=419.0s)]
*  We always appreciate your time. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRLC5PM4E4&t=422.0s)]
