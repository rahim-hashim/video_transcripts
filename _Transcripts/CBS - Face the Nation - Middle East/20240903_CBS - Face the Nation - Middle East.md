# Columbia University protests resume as new semester starts
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc)
*  All right, new this hour, protesters outside Columbia University are calling on the school [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=0.0s)]
*  to cut ties with Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=6.8s)]
*  The demand stems from the ongoing war with Hamas, and they're making these demands on [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=9.78s)]
*  what is the first day of classes there. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Liliya Luciano has been covering these protests earlier this [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=16.8s)]
*  year. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=20.96s)]
*  You see here at Columbia with more. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=21.96s)]
*  Liliya, how are these demonstrations, I don't know, the same and different from what we [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=23.16s)]
*  saw in the spring? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=26.82s)]
*  I guess, Errol, the goal, the divestment, the requests are the same as you mentioned [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=29.24s)]
*  just now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=35.52s)]
*  But the size, the scope is much smaller. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=36.72s)]
*  Today is day one of classes. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=39.36s)]
*  There was kind of an instant call to protest. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=41.24s)]
*  I follow a lot of the channels where back in the spring semester, students were communicating [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=43.64s)]
*  and organizers were communicating, and there had been no calls for protest. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=49.0s)]
*  But this morning at 9.30, they called for people to assemble outside of the gates, for [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=52.6s)]
*  people to not show up to class, to not let school begin, and of course demanding, as [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=57.24s)]
*  you said, the divestment of the university from anything connected to Israel. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=61.88s)]
*  And so what we've seen is a few dozen protesters. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=66.84s)]
*  First, they started here on 116th Street and Broadway, which is where a lot of protests [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=70.08s)]
*  outside of the campus had started last time. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  And then there were a handful of counter protesters who showed up, and the students themselves [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  then moved to Barnard, which is across the street, and said what I heard from some of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=82.44s)]
*  them was that they felt it would be safer to just continue manifesting there. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=86.76s)]
*  Everything very peaceful. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=90.36s)]
*  I have not, we haven't confirmed arrests yet from NYPD, but I had seen some videos of maybe [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=91.36s)]
*  some scuffles with police. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=97.12s)]
*  I'm yet to verify those. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=99.2s)]
*  What I've seen so far, the time, the hours that I've been here, was all very peaceful, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=101.2s)]
*  very calm. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=105.84s)]
*  And as I said, the students just moved from one gate to the other. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=106.84s)]
*  I mean, to the other university, to Barnard. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=110.44s)]
*  You had mentioned in your reporting earlier, Liliya, that this just isn't only happening [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=113.08s)]
*  at Columbia. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=116.88s)]
*  There were some other protests at other major universities in the spring, and school presidents, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=117.88s)]
*  some of them resigned over the response, some saying they went too far, others saying they [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=123.48s)]
*  didn't go far enough. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=128.0s)]
*  The school president there resigned just a few weeks ago. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=129.52s)]
*  How now, then, is the school responding to this new round of demonstrations? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=132.56s)]
*  That's right, Errol. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=138.96s)]
*  Menuh Shafik, the former president of Columbia University, resigned. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  The person who was interim president was the person who headed the medical school. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=143.12s)]
*  And what they have done is they limited access to the school. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=148.0s)]
*  In a similar way to how the university handled the protests last time around, there are no [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=150.68s)]
*  encampments inside of campus. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  We are not allowed in at any time, as was the case in the past. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=158.12s)]
*  As you can see, there's that tent behind me where there's staff checking for school IDs [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=161.8s)]
*  and any visitors must pre-register to enter the university. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  But inside, last time we were here, there was that encampment. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=170.6s)]
*  Of course, the police calling and the university calling on police, and the idea of removing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  the encampment is what accelerated into what we saw, which were those very serious clashes, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=178.72s)]
*  the taking over one of the halls of the university. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=184.84s)]
*  For now, the university, of course, has issued messages to parents, to students. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=188.32s)]
*  What they are saying is not anybody can come into the university at this point, and that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=197.39999999999998s)]
*  they're going to continue monitoring. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=201.88s)]
*  There are some security measures that have been taken, not just in Columbia University, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  but other universities like NYU, which the school staff, the leadership at the university [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=208.2s)]
*  has presented as ways to not just protect the safety of students, but also to fight [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=213.52s)]
*  anti-Semitism, which students in these universities have been denouncing as attempts at censorship [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  or at limiting their freedom of speech. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  We will, of course, continue to monitor what happens today, but I'll tell you this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=228.28s)]
*  The protest for today here at Columbia, for the moment, has ended. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  The one that moved over there, students removed their posters and what they had and disbursed. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=236.72s)]
*  Well, Liliya Luciano, we appreciate you staying on this story. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=244.28s)]
*  Thanks very much. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=247.4s)]
*  Thanks, John. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5TqUAFgHmc&t=249.4s)]
