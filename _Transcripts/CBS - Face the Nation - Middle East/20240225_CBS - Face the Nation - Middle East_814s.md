# Benjamin Netanyahu says the U.S. would be "doing a hell of a lot more" after a terror attack
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [February 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE)
*  Turn now to the crisis in the Middle East and the war between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining us from Tel Aviv is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=4.48s)]
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation, sir. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=10.8s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=11.8s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, the U.S. is working on a hostage deal that President Biden has said [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=13.36s)]
*  would bring with it at least six weeks of calm. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=18.0s)]
*  The intelligence chiefs met on Friday. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=22.04s)]
*  Are we close to a deal? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Well, I'm not sure the exact duration, but I can tell you that we're all working on it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=26.2s)]
*  We want it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=30.4s)]
*  I want it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=31.4s)]
*  Because we want to liberate the remaining hostages. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=32.4s)]
*  We've already brought half of them back. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=34.8s)]
*  And I appreciate the effort, the combined effort of Israel, the United States, to bring [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  back the remaining hostages. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=42.06s)]
*  I can't tell you if we'll have it, but if Hamas goes down from its delusional claims [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=43.44s)]
*  and goes down, can bring them down to earth, then we'll have the progress that we all want. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=48.64s)]
*  What specifically is holding up the deal at this point? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=53.72s)]
*  Reportedly, this would have 30 to 40 hostages, women, elderly, wounded released in exchange [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=56.8s)]
*  for a few hundred Palestinian prisoners being released. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=63.7s)]
*  Hamas started out with just crazy demands. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=67.24s)]
*  And it's too soon to say if they've abandoned them, but if they do abandon them and get [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=70.56s)]
*  into what you call the ballpark. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=77.16s)]
*  They're not even in the city. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=79.68s)]
*  They're in another planet. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=81.88s)]
*  But if they come down to a reasonable situation, then yes, we'll have a hostage. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  There are at least six U.S. citizens among those being held by Hamas. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=90.64s)]
*  For you, is the return of living hostages necessary and essential for you to declare [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=95.88s)]
*  victory in this war? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=103.32s)]
*  I've set three war goals. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=104.84s)]
*  The first is to release the hostages. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=107.08s)]
*  The second is to destroy Hamas. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  And the third is to ensure that Gaza does not pose a threat to Israel in the future. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=112.82s)]
*  And obviously, the three are intertwined. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=118.5s)]
*  They're achieved basically by our very effective and often heroic military operation and also [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=120.89999999999999s)]
*  by tough negotiations. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  We're combining the two, and I hope it yields a result. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=128.85999999999999s)]
*  But understand that unless we have total victory, we can't have peace. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=132.85999999999999s)]
*  We can't leave Hamas in place. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=136.7s)]
*  We can't leave a quarter of Hamas battalions in Rafah and say, well, that's fine. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=138.08s)]
*  On the issue of the hostages, as you know, time is of the essence here. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=143.8s)]
*  So if this deal happens and there are six weeks of calm that go with it, does that provide [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  an opening to end this war? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=153.0s)]
*  Or will you still go into southern Gaza, into Rafah, regardless? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well, victory is within reach, and you can't have victory until you eliminate Hamas. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=159.56s)]
*  How within reach? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=165.96s)]
*  Once we begin the Rafah operation, the intense phase of the fighting is weeks away from completion. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=169.88s)]
*  Not months, weeks away from completion. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  And that is we've already destroyed 18 out of the 24 Hamas terrorist battalions. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=178.86s)]
*  So we have a few, and four of them are concentrated in Rafah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=185.12s)]
*  We can't leave the last Hamas stronghold without taking care of it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=188.66s)]
*  So we have to do it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=194.72s)]
*  But understand, too, that I've asked the army to submit to me a double plan. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=195.92s)]
*  First, to evacuate, to enable the evacuation of the Palestinian civilians in Gaza. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=200.52s)]
*  And obviously, second, to destroy the remaining Hamas battalions. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=206.6s)]
*  That gets us a real, real distance towards the completion of our victory. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=211.0s)]
*  And that, we're not going to give it up. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=217.24s)]
*  If we have a deal, it'll be delayed somewhat, but it'll happen. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=219.2s)]
*  If we don't have a deal, we'll do it anyway. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=222.67999999999998s)]
*  It has to be done because total victory is our goal, and total victory is within reach. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=225.32s)]
*  Not months away, weeks away once we begin the operation. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=230.6s)]
*  Well, the White House says they need to see a credible and executable plan to protect [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  civilians and the 1.4 million people who are sheltering in southern Gaza. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=238.16s)]
*  This morning, the White House says they still have not seen such a plan, and no major military [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=243.17999999999998s)]
*  operation should proceed without it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=247.88s)]
*  Have you approved the plans that you said you've asked for? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=251.23999999999998s)]
*  Actually, Margaret, I'm going from here to a meeting with the general staff where they're [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=254.76s)]
*  going to show me this dual plan. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=260.56s)]
*  A plan to evacuate and a plan to dismantle those remaining battalions. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=262.32s)]
*  So yes, by the way, we agree on this. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  We don't have to be prodded. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=271.24s)]
*  We're on the same page with the U.S. on this because that's how we do it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=273.2s)]
*  The reason you have that population in Ra'afah is because we actually cleared them away from [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=277.08s)]
*  the other places, the combat zones that we had. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  That's why they're there. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=286.76s)]
*  So now there's room for them to go north of Ra'afah to the places that we've already finished [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=287.88s)]
*  fighting in. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  That's where you're going to move. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  That's basically what we're going to do. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  That's the plan, to move 1.4 million people into northern Gaza. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  Can you guarantee that the IDF will not push? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=300.4s)]
*  I didn't say northern Gaza. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=302.36s)]
*  I said north of Ra'afah. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=303.36s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=307.04s)]
*  I said north of Ra'afah. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=308.04s)]
*  In the northern part of the Gaza Strip, we still have fighting going on. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=309.04s)]
*  But that is important. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=312.0s)]
*  It's important to understand moving civilians out of an area that is going to be a combat [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=314.32s)]
*  zone is not a bad thing. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=319.76s)]
*  It's a good thing. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=322.78000000000003s)]
*  And that's what Israel is going to do. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  Understood. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=324.78000000000003s)]
*  But the IDF, can you guarantee that they won't push Palestinians out of Gaza and into Egypt? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=325.78000000000003s)]
*  As you know, Egyptian officials have said if you do that, you are putting at risk 46 [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=331.2s)]
*  years of peace. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=336.64s)]
*  Look, I think that the Egyptians know very well that that's not our purpose and that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=337.64s)]
*  won't be the result. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=342.96s)]
*  And we're coordinating. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=344.2s)]
*  We're talking to the Egyptians all the time. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=345.2s)]
*  So that's not I don't think that's an issue. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=347.8s)]
*  The peace between Israel and Egypt to serve the interests of both countries and will continue [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  to serve the interests of both countries, I don't think it's in any danger. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=354.76s)]
*  You said that victory is within reach, but U.S. Intel says the IDF has only destroyed [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=359.48s)]
*  30 percent of Hamas leadership and that the amount of tunnels that Hamas uses have really [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=364.4s)]
*  only been tiny in terms of what has been destroyed by the IDF. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=372.54s)]
*  There is growing distrust of you personally, sir. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=377.32s)]
*  You know this in the U.S. Congress and within the Biden White House. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=380.9s)]
*  When your closest ally is telling you things like this and telling you that you need to [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=385.7s)]
*  reconsider a strategy, isn't it worth considering? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=391.3s)]
*  Look, I think that the U.S. agrees with us on the goal of destroying Hamas. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=395.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=400.21999999999997s)]
*  And on the goal of releasing the hostages. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=401.21999999999997s)]
*  The decisions of how to do that are left with us and with me and the elected cabinet of [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=403.62s)]
*  Israel. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=409.09999999999997s)]
*  And we're doing that. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=410.1s)]
*  A lot of things that we were told by the best of friends initially turned out not to be [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=411.1s)]
*  true. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=417.14000000000004s)]
*  They said you can't enter the ground war without having enormous complications. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=418.14000000000004s)]
*  They said you cannot fight, you can't enter Gaza City, you can't go into the tunnels, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=422.46000000000004s)]
*  it will be a terrible bloodbath. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=427.38s)]
*  All of that turned out to be not true. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=429.22s)]
*  Our soldiers are in the tunnel network. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=431.5s)]
*  We don't have to take apart hundreds of kilometers of tunnels. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=433.38s)]
*  We are taking apart. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=436.48s)]
*  The missile production factories that are underground, the command and control headquarters, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=437.9s)]
*  the computers that are there, the money that is there, the weapons that are there and the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=442.78s)]
*  ammos that is there. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=446.34s)]
*  We're doing that methodically. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=447.82s)]
*  So we're doing the war. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=449.29999999999995s)]
*  You can't substitute for the Israeli military command. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=451.9s)]
*  And we're doing it very responsibly. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=455.97999999999996s)]
*  The John Spencer, who's the head of urban warfare at West Point, says that no other [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=458.14s)]
*  army has gone to the lengths that Israel's army has gone to clear civilians out of harm's [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=462.17999999999995s)]
*  way, even though Hamas is doing everything to keep them in harm's way. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=467.22s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=470.26s)]
*  But the former head of Central Command was on this program just a few weeks ago and said, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=471.26s)]
*  basically, you have not articulated any specific end game here. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=474.18s)]
*  But putting that aside, I want to come back to a few different things you said. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=478.66s)]
*  Wait a minute, Margaret, hold on. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=481.66s)]
*  You lob these grenades at me and you keep on moving. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=483.18s)]
*  Well, first of all, you say there's no confidence in me. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=486.82s)]
*  Well, the Israeli public has confidence in me. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=490.14s)]
*  Last week... [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=492.66s)]
*  There were massive protests throughout Israel yesterday. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=493.66s)]
*  Of course, we have protests. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=496.65999999999997s)]
*  We have protests. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=498.5s)]
*  Israel is a democracy. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=499.5s)]
*  We've had protests for 30 years. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=500.5s)]
*  But the Israeli people are united as never before. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=502.12s)]
*  Last week, they voted 99 to 9 in the Knesset for my proposal that says that we have to [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=505.38s)]
*  do two things. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=512.62s)]
*  We have to win the war, have total victory, but also not have an international dictate [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=513.62s)]
*  of a Palestinian state on it, shove down our throats, that would endanger Israel. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=518.34s)]
*  The people are overwhelmingly united on this. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=522.78s)]
*  When is the last time we had 99 votes in the Knesset? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=525.22s)]
*  I'll tell you, 30 years ago. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=527.94s)]
*  So the people are united. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=530.3000000000001s)]
*  The policy is right. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=532.1s)]
*  The people support it. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=533.38s)]
*  And I intend to take it to completion because that's what we have. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=535.0600000000001s)]
*  We can't compromise with total victory because I'll tell you, we can't win the peace if we [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=538.38s)]
*  don't win the war. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=543.26s)]
*  And we will win this war. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=544.34s)]
*  One of the members of the Knesset, the former Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid, said he [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=546.1s)]
*  He asked the Americans about what you just said about a unilateral declaration of recognition [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=550.22s)]
*  of Palestinian state. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=555.34s)]
*  And he said, you invented a threat that doesn't exist. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=556.34s)]
*  There is not one official in the world that suggested unilateral recognition of the Palestinians. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=559.34s)]
*  So putting that aside, I want to- [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=564.34s)]
*  Yeah, actually, the foreign secretary of Britain just spoke about it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=565.86s)]
*  There have been many- [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=570.58s)]
*  Well, this is the US. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=571.58s)]
*  I hope that's true. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=572.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=573.58s)]
*  We've heard a lot of briefings coming from the US to that effect. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=574.58s)]
*  So I hope it's true. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=579.6s)]
*  And if it's true, then that will reinforce the decision made by the government, by the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=580.88s)]
*  people of Israel through their elected representatives. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=588.16s)]
*  And by the way, if people try to foist it on us, it would be a terrible mistake because [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=591.48s)]
*  it would be seen as a reward for terror after the most atrocious attack committed against [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=595.8000000000001s)]
*  the Jewish people since the Holocaust. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=601.32s)]
*  So people of Israel are not going to buy it. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=603.12s)]
*  And if you want peace, you shouldn't go that route. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=606.12s)]
*  Peace will be achieved through direct negotiations between the parties down the line. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=608.24s)]
*  I don't think the Palestinians are ready for it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=612.04s)]
*  But when they are, that's the way it will be achieved, not by international fiat. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=614.24s)]
*  I want to come back to something you said where you were raising questions about US [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=617.6800000000001s)]
*  intelligence and advice to you from the Biden administration, where you said it was wrong. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=622.36s)]
*  You also said there was no bloodbath. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=626.72s)]
*  I didn't say it was wrong. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=629.2s)]
*  I said some good friends gave us advice. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=630.2s)]
*  Advice that turned out to be that we performed a lot better than they anticipated. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=633.76s)]
*  And by the way, we performed a lot better than we anticipated. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=638.84s)]
*  Well, on the no bloodbath, Doctors Without Borders went to the UN this week and said [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=642.2s)]
*  the civilian toll in Gaza is so high they came up with a new term, wounded child, no [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=648.48s)]
*  surviving family. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=654.12s)]
*  Save the Children says there are over a thousand children who have lost a limb over these past [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=656.16s)]
*  days since the beginning of the October 7th war. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=661.5600000000001s)]
*  What Hamas has done is horrific. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=665.5600000000001s)]
*  But President Biden has said your actions, sir, are over the top. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=667.96s)]
*  Aren't you concerned that Israel is creating more terrorists than it is killing? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=674.72s)]
*  I think that any civilian casualty is a tragedy. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=680.04s)]
*  And I don't say that halfheartedly. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=683.28s)]
*  I lost a brother in war. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=687.32s)]
*  I myself was wounded while releasing hostages from a hijacked plane. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=688.48s)]
*  I've lost friends in battle. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=695.0s)]
*  I know what it means to lose friends and what it means to lose family members. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=697.48s)]
*  So we don't have an argument there. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=701.8000000000001s)]
*  But this war has been forced upon us by a cynical enemy that not only targets our civilians, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=704.0s)]
*  has raped, beheaded, burnt babies alive, killed children in front of their parents and parents [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=709.6s)]
*  in front of their children. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=715.3000000000001s)]
*  This enemy not only targets civilians, but hides behind civilians, Palestinian civilians. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=718.24s)]
*  So they're committing a double war crime. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=724.5600000000001s)]
*  I have to come back and say that in terms of the way this battle is fought, there is [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=727.1600000000001s)]
*  no parallel to the difficulty that we face. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=732.6800000000001s)]
*  And John Spencer, the head of urban warfare at West Point, says that no other army has [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=735.72s)]
*  faced such a task. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=740.32s)]
*  He gives one comparison. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=741.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's not the question I asked, though. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=742.32s)]
*  It gives most of the comparison. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=743.32s)]
*  Well, it is. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=745.84s)]
*  But that's the answer. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=746.84s)]
*  You can't say, oh, you give immunity to the terrorists because they're hiding among civilians [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=747.84s)]
*  and forcing civilians not to leave. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=753.24s)]
*  So what do you do? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=755.56s)]
*  You say, OK, we'll give you immunity. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=756.56s)]
*  Hamas survives. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=758.56s)]
*  We live to fight another, to commit another massacre and another massacre. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=762.4s)]
*  What would America do? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=765.96s)]
*  What would America do, Margaret, if you face the equivalent of 2911s, 50,000 Americans [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=767.6s)]
*  slaughtered in one day, 10,000 Americans, including mothers and children, held hostage? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=774.0799999999999s)]
*  Would you not be doing what Israel is doing? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=779.0s)]
*  You'd be doing a hell of a lot more. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=780.88s)]
*  And all Americans that I talk to nearly all say that. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=782.64s)]
*  So Israel has gone to extraordinary lengths, calling up people, civilians, Palestinians [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=785.52s)]
*  in Gaza, telling them, leave your home, sending pamphlets. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=789.92s)]
*  We have done that effort. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=794.5s)]
*  Hamas tries to keep them at one point. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=795.5s)]
*  We'll clear them out of harm's way. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=797.8399999999999s)]
*  And complete the job and achieve total victory, which is necessary to give a secure future [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=799.86s)]
*  for Israel, a better future for Gaza, a better future for the Middle East and a setback for [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=804.86s)]
*  the Iran terror axis. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=809.84s)]
*  That's in all our interests. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=811.54s)]
*  It's in America's interest, too. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSq0ioXTJE&t=812.86s)]
