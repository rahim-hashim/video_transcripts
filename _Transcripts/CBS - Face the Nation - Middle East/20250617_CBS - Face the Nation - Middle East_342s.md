# Israeli ambassador to U.S. on Iran's alleged nuclear capabilities
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o)
*  Welcome back to The Takeout. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=0.0s)]
*  Continuing our conversation with the Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Michael Leiter. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=2.16s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, as you well know, it's a three-tiered process for any nuclear power. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=5.68s)]
*  You first have to develop the nuclear material. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=13.08s)]
*  You have to put it in a deliverable system, meaning a bomb, and then you have to have [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=15.56s)]
*  a targeting mechanism by which you can deliver that lethal weapon. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=18.92s)]
*  What does Israel know about Iran's capabilities in all three categories? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=24.12s)]
*  We know that they have moved very close to the precipice in all three categories. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=32.36s)]
*  They will have a deliverability of a nuclear weapon within a matter of weeks, and our intel [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=36.04s)]
*  showed that very clearly. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  The damning report of the IAEA, which came out on the 60th day of the warning letter [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=45.0s)]
*  that the president sent to the Ayatollah indicated that and really vindicated what our prime [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=50.92s)]
*  minister has been saying for 15 years. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=57.32s)]
*  They're racing to a nuclear bomb, and we had to stop it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=59.32s)]
*  I think it's very important to appreciate what we're talking about, what we're talking [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=62.44s)]
*  about when we talk about the mullahs, the Ayatollah of Tehran. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=66.8s)]
*  This is a government that sent assassination squads to assassinate the president of the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=71.28s)]
*  United States twice. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=77.32s)]
*  This is an Ayatollah who sent an assassination squad to take out former Secretary of State [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=78.56s)]
*  Mike Pompeo. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=84.2s)]
*  It's the same Ayatollah that sits in the middle of Tehran with thousands of people and screams [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=85.2s)]
*  death to America, death to Israel, death to the West. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  A nuclear bomb in the hands of somebody screaming death to America, it doesn't add up. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, you mentioned Prime Minister Netanyahu warning for 15 years about this [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=99.08s)]
*  prospect that came up in social media conversation that the vice president of the United States, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=103.56s)]
*  JD Vance, felt the need to address today because some in the Make America Great movement were [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=108.92s)]
*  writing on social media, Israel's been howling their words, not mine, about this for years [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=114.68s)]
*  and years and years. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=120.04s)]
*  Why should we believe them now when they said Iran was on the cusp of this six years ago, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=121.04s)]
*  eight years ago, some number of years longer ago than that? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=126.12s)]
*  I certainly don't want to get involved in a domestic discussion about policy. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  I just know one thing, that we don't have a second chance. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=138.72s)]
*  Eighty years ago, somebody ran around Europe saying he'd like to terminate the Jews of [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=142.08s)]
*  Europe. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=148.4s)]
*  He was a malevolent actor in the international scene. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=149.6s)]
*  He caused chaos in the countries around him, and everybody appeased him. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=154.12s)]
*  They said, well, we'll give it time. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  We'll try to see if negotiations and diplomacy will work. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=159.24s)]
*  At the end of the day, avoiding that war caused a war that took 65 million lives and 6 million [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=162.76s)]
*  Jews in gas chambers. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=169.2s)]
*  We're not there again. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=170.48s)]
*  This war that we're prosecuting against Iran is the war to end wars, to make sure that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=172.32s)]
*  we can move into a mode of an Abraham Accord Middle East, where countries line up to normalize [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=176.56s)]
*  relations with Israel, and we're quite convinced that that's where we're going. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=182.0s)]
*  We had four countries in the first Trump administration to make peace with us, and we think that in [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=185.92s)]
*  Trump 2.0, there are going to be many more that are going to line up to make peace as [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=190.9s)]
*  soon as this menace of a potential nuclear Iran is removed from the scene. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  And Mr. Ambassador, just to make it clear, if I hear you correctly, the United States [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=200.38s)]
*  does not need to be a participant militarily, directly, for you to achieve the goal you [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=204.78s)]
*  just outlined. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  You know, the president has a very clear agenda. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=214.78s)]
*  He has a very clear understanding of the international community. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  I think he has a very clear understanding of the threat that Iran poses to the United [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=223.6s)]
*  States and to the world. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=228.68s)]
*  And the president and his administration will take a decision, and Israel stands by the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=230.6s)]
*  best friend that it ever had in the White House and President Trump, and we're confident [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=237.16s)]
*  in our partnership, we're confident in our ally. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=242.0s)]
*  We thank the United States for the defensive systems that they put at our disposal that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=244.68s)]
*  have saved hundreds and thousands of lives in these THAAD and Aegis missile defense systems [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=248.6s)]
*  over the past couple of days, and we're very appreciative looking into the future as well. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=253.12s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, going forward, what is the risk profile for Israeli civilians, acknowledging [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=258.36s)]
*  what you just said, there is a missile defense system, a robust one, and if I heard you correctly, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=265.4s)]
*  Israel has dramatically degraded Iran's ability to continue to fire ballistic missiles. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=270.92s)]
*  What is the risk profile for your civilians? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=276.88s)]
*  There's a risk that still exists, unfortunately. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=279.76s)]
*  We haven't completely demolished the surface-to-surface missiles that the Iranians are firing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=285.56s)]
*  You know, they fire by intention into densely populated civilian areas. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  When we strike into Iran, we tell the people to leave first. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=297.15999999999997s)]
*  That's the fundamental, inherent difference between our two societies, between our two [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=302.88000000000005s)]
*  governments and the way we behave. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  We will continue, we're pursuing every day the process of taking out these surface-to-surface [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=311.56s)]
*  missiles, these ballistic missiles that they're firing at us, and we've demoted, demolished [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=318.32000000000005s)]
*  about half of their inventory, and as the days go on, we're going to remove the rest [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=323.48s)]
*  of them from threatening our civilians. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=329.6s)]
*  Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Michael Leiter, Mr. Ambassador, thank you for your time. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=332.72s)]
*  I hope you'll come back. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=336.48s)]
*  Good to be with you, Major. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=339.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g72H1XNpV7o&t=340.76s)]
