# Netanyahu remains defiant amid pressure to reach Gaza cease-fire deal
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A)
*  We're gonna start here though. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=0.84s)]
*  is remaining defiant amid mounting pressure [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=3.0s)]
*  to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=6.24s)]
*  He's vowing to maintain his major sticking point [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=9.48s)]
*  for a deal, including the condition that Israel [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=11.96s)]
*  will keep control of the border between Gaza and Egypt. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=14.44s)]
*  Thousands of Israelis took to the streets [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  to protest the strike yesterday, demanding a deal. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=20.16s)]
*  The recovery of six dead hostages in Gaza [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=23.6s)]
*  sparked the demonstrations. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=27.28s)]
*  Among the victims was an Israeli American man, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=29.16s)]
*  Hirsh Goldberg-Holland. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=31.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, two key allies are also ramping up pressure [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=33.8s)]
*  on Netanyahu. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=36.56s)]
*  President Biden told reporters he thinks [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=37.660000000000004s)]
*  the Israeli Prime Minister is not doing enough [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=39.96s)]
*  to secure a hostage deal, and the UK has announced [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  that it will suspend some arms sales to Israel. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=44.84s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent, MTS Tayyab, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  is following all of this for us from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  MTS, good morning. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=52.36s)]
*  Anne-Marie, good morning to you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=56.16s)]
*  Well, you can imagine there's a lot of pain and grief [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=57.28s)]
*  and anger on the streets as Israelis continue [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=59.72s)]
*  to protest, demanding for that ceasefire. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=62.24s)]
*  And yet, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=64.8s)]
*  continues to push back against this pressure, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=66.8s)]
*  of course, to agree to that deal, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=69.88s)]
*  following the killings of the six captives in Gaza. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=72.12s)]
*  Now, that includes 23-year-old Israeli American [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=75.44s)]
*  Hirsh Goldberg-Holland. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=77.72s)]
*  Now, as tens of thousands of Israelis continue [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  to demand Netanyahu bring an end to the war in Gaza [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=81.72s)]
*  and free the remaining captives, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=84.76s)]
*  he did seem to show what some of them [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=86.64s)]
*  have been describing as a rare act of contrition, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=89.44s)]
*  addressing the nation, asking for forgiveness. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=92.56s)]
*  Anne-Marie, I have to say, his tone quickly shifted, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=95.84s)]
*  and he then said he would not give into pressure, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=99.2s)]
*  and then went on to what some are describing [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=102.16s)]
*  as a lecture, where he insisted Israel must retain control [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  of the Philadelphia corridor, which is this narrow strip [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=108.72s)]
*  of land along Gaza's southern border with Egypt [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  that he says is used to smuggle weapons. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, this is an allegation that both Egypt and Hamas deny, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=117.68s)]
*  with Hamas saying there will be no deal [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=121.16s)]
*  unless Israeli forces withdraw. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, speaking to reporters outside the White House, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=126.04s)]
*  President Biden said it was clear Netanyahu [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=128.04s)]
*  isn't doing enough to end the war. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=131.0s)]
*  Now, this is as thousands of people gathered [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=133.2s)]
*  in Jerusalem on Monday to say their last goodbyes [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  to Israeli American Hirsh Goldberg-Holland. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=138.96s)]
*  His body was recovered from that Gaza tunnel [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=142.0s)]
*  alongside the remains of five other hostages, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=145.08s)]
*  and initial autopsy reports found all were shot dead [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=148.0s)]
*  within days of being found. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=151.28s)]
*  All of this as the war on Gaza rages on, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=153.8s)]
*  at least eight Palestinians were killed [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  in an Israeli strike while they were trying to buy bread. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=158.72s)]
*  And as the UN's campaign to vaccinate [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=162.4s)]
*  640,000 Palestinian children against polio continues. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  Still, Prime Minister Netanyahu's address to the nation [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  continues to be criticized, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=171.8s)]
*  with the opposition leader Yair Lapid calling it [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=173.8s)]
*  an unfounded political spin, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=176.56s)]
*  and said Netanyahu's insistence Israel's security [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=179.4s)]
*  relies on its forces remaining [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  in the Philadelphia corridor, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=184.52s)]
*  and Marie has, in his words, no relation to reality. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  MTS, thank you very much. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=192.08s)]
*  So we're gonna dig a little deeper [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=194.88000000000002s)]
*  into the conflict in the Middle East. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=196.44s)]
*  I wanna bring in Samantha Vinograd. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=198.0s)]
*  She is a CBS News national security contributor [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=200.0s)]
*  and the former US Assistant Secretary for Counterterrorism. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=202.6s)]
*  So, listen to what MTS said about the Philadelphia, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=206.92s)]
*  sorry, Philadelphia corridor. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=211.2s)]
*  Some have accused the Prime Minister [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=214.88s)]
*  of moving the goalpost, because in earlier negotiations, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=218.12s)]
*  I don't remember this strip of land being a non-negotiable, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=221.2s)]
*  but it seems that it is now. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=226.44s)]
*  Tell us about the significance of this strip of land, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=228.86s)]
*  and does Benjamin Netanyahu have a point, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=231.42000000000002s)]
*  that it is crucial when it comes to security [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=235.10000000000002s)]
*  of Israel in the future? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=238.34s)]
*  Well, Anne Marie, having been involved in discussions [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=240.46s)]
*  post-October 7th in the Situation Room [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=242.9s)]
*  about Israel's security, I can tell you [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=245.18s)]
*  that Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=247.66000000000003s)]
*  since October 7th and well before, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=249.46s)]
*  has been uniquely focused on the complete eradication [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=251.86s)]
*  of Hamas. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=255.62s)]
*  That has been a sticking point for him from day one. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=256.7s)]
*  So, the Philadelphia corridor in Prime Minister [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=261.06s)]
*  Netanyahu's mind has been an existential matter [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=263.7s)]
*  because he believes that if the Philadelphia corridor [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=267.09999999999997s)]
*  is not patrolled by Israeli Defense Forces, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=270.9s)]
*  that Hamas will not be eradicated. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=273.82s)]
*  It will be able to continue to get weapons [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=276.06s)]
*  and funds from Egypt, and that is why he has been so focused [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=278.74s)]
*  on maintaining control of the Philadelphia corridor, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=282.78s)]
*  Anne Marie. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=285.46s)]
*  Yesterday, President Biden said that he didn't think [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=287.5s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu was doing enough to secure [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=290.09999999999997s)]
*  the release of hostages. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=292.62s)]
*  I know the words are not particularly strong words, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=293.97999999999996s)]
*  they're outright direct, harsh criticism, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=297.78s)]
*  but it is a little bit of a shift in language, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=300.74s)]
*  and more direct language, and of course, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=302.82s)]
*  seeing what happened in the UK, where they voted in favor [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=304.7s)]
*  of holding back on some of the sort of military assistance [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=307.3s)]
*  that they've been giving to Israel. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=310.74s)]
*  I mean, how much should we read into these words [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=313.42s)]
*  and these decisions? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=316.94s)]
*  Well, just to note, the UK decision to withhold [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=319.38s)]
*  certain weapons is not linked to Netanyahu's position [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=321.82s)]
*  in the negotiations. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=325.02s)]
*  It is linked to the fact that the UK government believes [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=326.34s)]
*  that there is a chance that these weapons could be used [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=330.02s)]
*  for purposes that could harm humanitarian matters [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=334.3s)]
*  and otherwise, so it is not linked [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=338.94s)]
*  to the ceasefire negotiations. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=340.38s)]
*  Biden certainly had a change in tone, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=342.02s)]
*  and I would expect more of that if Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=344.53999999999996s)]
*  sticks to his insistence that Israel not fully withdraw [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=348.14s)]
*  from the Philadelphia corridor during, for example, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=351.94s)]
*  phase one of the bridging proposal [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=354.41999999999996s)]
*  that President Biden laid out. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=356.14s)]
*  Other than harsh rhetoric, however, Anne Marie, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=358.02s)]
*  President Biden is between a rock and a hard place [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=360.9s)]
*  in terms of leverage he can put on Israel [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=363.58s)]
*  to change its position in these negotiations. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=366.41999999999996s)]
*  Now, I do want to underscore, Hamas is responsible [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=369.26000000000005s)]
*  for the brutal murder of these hostages and others, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=372.26000000000005s)]
*  and a key question is not just Prime Minister Netanyahu's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=374.82000000000005s)]
*  position, but what pressure is being put on Qatar and Egypt [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=378.54s)]
*  to try to push Hamas to make a deal as well. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=382.06s)]
*  Now, I know you're not one of our political commentators, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=384.3s)]
*  but I wonder if the fact that we're just a handful of months [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=386.66s)]
*  away from an election is also sort of putting [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=389.54s)]
*  additional pressure on President Biden. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=392.22s)]
*  Well, I'm not a political commentator, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=395.3s)]
*  but I have known and worked with President Biden since 2009, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=397.14s)]
*  and I will tell you that politics have not directed [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=400.97999999999996s)]
*  his position on Israel's security or humanitarian issues. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=404.38s)]
*  So I do not think that the upcoming election [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=407.9s)]
*  is putting additional pressure on President Biden. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=410.09999999999997s)]
*  Again, having been in the room post-October 7th, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=412.18s)]
*  returning the hostages, getting a ceasefire deal, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=415.86s)]
*  and getting humanitarian assistance into Gaza [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=418.46s)]
*  has been a moral and security priority for the president [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=420.46s)]
*  since Hamas' brutal attack on October 7th. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=423.7s)]
*  All right, Samantha, thank you very much. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=426.58000000000004s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cu4BnZ90A&t=428.66s)]
