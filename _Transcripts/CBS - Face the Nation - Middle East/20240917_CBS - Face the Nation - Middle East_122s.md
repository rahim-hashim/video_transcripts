# At least 9 killed, thousands injured in Lebanon, Syria pager explosions
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc)
*  We go now to the Middle East where thousands were injured and nine died after handheld [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=0.0s)]
*  pagers used by Hezbollah members exploded all at the same time. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  Explosions happened across Lebanon and Syria on Tuesday. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=10.32s)]
*  Both the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the Lebanese government blamed Israel for the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=12.82s)]
*  attack amid ongoing tensions linked to the war in Gaza. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=16.56s)]
*  Elizabeth Palmer is in Tel Aviv for us with the latest. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=20.64s)]
*  It was mid-afternoon when the pagers went off, apparently simultaneously in at least [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=24.6s)]
*  three cities across Lebanon. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=29.8s)]
*  Hezbollah fighters had no warning. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=32.32s)]
*  Social media shows the devices going off while they were in shops, driving, even walking [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=34.92s)]
*  down the street. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=40.88s)]
*  Ambulances rushed hundreds of victims to hospitals. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=42.8s)]
*  The pagers may be small, but the blasts were powerful enough to shred faces, tear off fingers, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=46.52s)]
*  and injure torsos. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=52.92s)]
*  Hezbollah immediately announced who it blamed. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=55.52s)]
*  An anchor on its TV channel, Al-Manar, said, we hold the Israeli enemy responsible for [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=58.32s)]
*  this criminal attack. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=63.68s)]
*  One high-profile diplomatic casualty was Iran's ambassador to Lebanon. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=66.08s)]
*  Iran, of course, is Hezbollah's main backer. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=70.88s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's chief, had told his men months ago to get rid of their smartphones [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=75.44s)]
*  because Israel could track them. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=81.0s)]
*  He issued the warning in the wake of several Israeli strikes that had killed Hezbollah commanders. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  But the low-tech alternative that Hezbollah turned to, these pagers, has proved deeply embarrassing. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=89.92s)]
*  Hezbollah knows that a very sophisticated sabotage operation got deep inside their equipment [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=96.92s)]
*  supply lines, and it's now bound to respond. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=102.44s)]
*  Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire on the border with Lebanon for the past few [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=107.56s)]
*  months. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  It may turn out that these exploding pagers ignite a much wider war. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  John? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=118.48s)]
*  Elizabeth Palmer in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=119.48s)]
*  Thank you, Liz. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmwVDaUfwc&t=121.28s)]
