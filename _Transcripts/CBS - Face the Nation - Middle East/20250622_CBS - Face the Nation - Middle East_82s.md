**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNui3EFQT68)
*  Go to Erbil, Iraq with Holly Williams. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNui3EFQT68&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister said this morning that the US has committed a grave violation [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNui3EFQT68&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  of international law and Iran has to respond. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNui3EFQT68&t=9.28s)]
*  warned last week that any US military intervention would be met with irreparable harm. It's thought [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNui3EFQT68&t=15.76s)]
*  that he is now in hiding in a bunker. Now US military bases here in the Middle East are [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNui3EFQT68&t=21.76s)]
*  obvious targets for Iranian retaliation and they are scattered across this region along with around [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNui3EFQT68&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  40,000 American troops. A second carrier strike group is on its way to the Middle East to boost [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNui3EFQT68&t=33.2s)]
*  US firepower. It is widely thought that Israel did not have the firepower to target the Fordow [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNui3EFQT68&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  nuclear site where Iran's been enriching uranium and which is buried inside a mountain. But now [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNui3EFQT68&t=45.84s)]
*  that the US has bombed it the question is what comes next. One outcome is that Iran capitulates [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNui3EFQT68&t=51.44s)]
*  and agrees to give up its nuclear program but another outcome is that Iran may be more motivated [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNui3EFQT68&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  than ever before to develop nuclear weapons to protect itself from further attack. One Iranian [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNui3EFQT68&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  lawmaker posted on social media overnight apparently speaking to that possibility saying quote [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNui3EFQT68&t=69.52s)]
*  that knowledge cannot be bombed. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNui3EFQT68&t=76.24000000000001s)]
