*  is often referred to as the people's army and the wide-scale exemption of ultra-orthodox men from [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uyhjkk-V24&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  conscription is a long-standing point of contention and it's come up a lot more because of the ongoing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uyhjkk-V24&t=24.24s)]
*  fighting in Gaza. What's seen in Israeli society as being the inequality in the way that the security [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uyhjkk-V24&t=32.239999999999995s)]

*  war the burden of inequality is harsher than ever and demands a solution. This ruling potentially [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uyhjkk-V24&t=45.36s)]
*  means that tens of thousands of ultra-orthodox men could now be drafted and it's also got implications [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uyhjkk-V24&t=51.2s)]
*  for the yeshivas where they study because the court also ruled that they should not continue to get [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uyhjkk-V24&t=58.0s)]
