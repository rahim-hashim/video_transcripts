# Israel strikes Iran, CBS News confirms
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY)
*  This is a CBS News special report. I'm Carissa Lawson in New York. We're coming on the air [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=0.0s)]
*  with breaking news out of the Middle East. Two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=12.42s)]
*  an Israeli missile has hit Iran. This comes after the weekend attack by Iran on Israel. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=16.96s)]
*  Face the Nation moderator and chief of foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan joins [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  us now. And Margaret, first, what are we learning about these strikes? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  Well, what we are learning is that this was a missile that hit Iran fired by Israel. These [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=32.0s)]
*  are really just initial reports that U.S. officials are confirming that this incident [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=41.2s)]
*  did occur. There was a strike carried out, but in terms of target damage assessment, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  there will be other strikes. We don't yet know the parameters for the Israeli operation that is [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=54.0s)]
*  underway right now. This may not be completely concluded, in other words. So this is happening, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=61.96s)]
*  and we know that there are members, for example, of the Senate Intelligence Committee out there [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  making public statements, Marco Rubio indicating that the city of Isfahan in Iran is nearby, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=76.44s)]
*  or there is an army base there that could have been a target. I mean, there's a lot of speculation [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=84.12s)]
*  happening by lawmakers, including those that should have been briefed, like Senator Rubio, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  but no official comment yet from the White House, the State Department, the Pentagon. Our sources, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  though, are confirming that an Israeli missile has hit Iran. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=100.16s)]
*  Do we know at this point how Iran might respond to these strikes? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  Well, this is a further escalation of a situation that we know the Biden administration was really [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  trying to put a lid on, that this tit for tat, they wanted to have concluded with that overwhelming [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=117.28s)]
*  drone attack that was stopped by Israeli air defenses over the weekend. IDF said they took [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=126.32s)]
*  down, what, 99 percent of the incoming projectiles, including missiles and drones. The Biden [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=134.56s)]
*  administration wanted to stop there. So the fact that Israel is carrying out this strike on their [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=139.88s)]
*  own, remember, the Biden administration said U.S. military would not participate in an offensive [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=146.88s)]
*  action against Iran. We know that there are hopes that this could just be a signal that Israel felt [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=153.68s)]
*  they had to, again, retaliate, but not necessarily further escalate. But make no mistake, another [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=161.36s)]
*  strike on the territory of Iran within their borders is an escalation. And since October the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  seventh and that dreadful Hamas attack on Israel, the major concern has been that a dispute within [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=177.12s)]
*  Israel and the Palestinian territories could then trigger broader Middle East war. We are now talking [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  about a state-on-state conflict that the United States is really trying to contain. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=190.72s)]
*  Yeah, America has been trying to contain it. So what do you think the American government's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=197.68s)]
*  response might be at this point now that this has happened? Well, at this hour, U.S. officials are [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=203.12s)]
*  silent on this, at least in an on-the-record capacity. We have no statements from the White [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=209.44s)]
*  House and the Pentagon from the State Department. Again, this is underway. But what we do know is [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  that there were diplomatic actions taken just within the past 24 hours to try to provide [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=218.56s)]
*  Israel's government and their prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, an off-ramp by saying, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=225.52s)]
*  look, the world has united behind you in terms of condemnation of what Iran carried out, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=232.48s)]
*  having gone through actions at the United Nations earlier today, widespread condemnation by members [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=238.16s)]
*  of the international community of that drone attack. There were also administration actions [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  today of further sanctions being put on Iran's drone program. So the world, including the United [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=252.16s)]
*  States, is trying to draw some lines here in terms of what is and is not acceptable behavior, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=259.04s)]
*  trying to rein in both Israel and Iran from escalating here. But obviously that did not stop [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=265.68s)]
*  the Netanyahu government from ordering this attack to take place, the attack that is underway at this [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=274.16s)]
*  hour. Now, there are reports of explosions in other areas at this point. We have not yet confirmed [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=280.16s)]
*  any of them. Some of these reported explosions in surrounding countries, for example, these could be [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=285.68s)]
*  sonic booms. These could be just other incidents. We don't know yet how widespread this action is [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=293.44s)]
*  at this hour. All we know is that there was this missile strike on the territory of Iran carried [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=301.36s)]
*  out by the Israeli military. And the concern for the Biden administration has been trying to contain [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=308.32s)]
*  this conflict so as also not to make Iran and its leadership feel so cornered that they go [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=317.04s)]
*  and charge forward with their nuclear program. Remember, Israel is a nuclear state. Iran at this [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=324.8s)]
*  point has nuclear program, but has not yet in the assessment of U.S. officials made the decision to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=331.84s)]
*  pursue a nuclear weapon. That is the concern here of the Biden administration, that escalation not [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=338.96s)]
*  just triggers war, but changes the calculus of Iran's leadership so that they actually pursue [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=345.67999999999995s)]
*  weaponization of a nuclear weapon. A big concern for sure. Margaret Brennan, thank you so much. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=351.28s)]
*  Again, two U.S. officials tell CBS News that an Israeli missile has hit Iran. Our coverage will [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=358.88s)]
*  continue on CBS News. This has been a CBS News special report. I'm Carissa Lawson in New York. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl-KmlEUbxY&t=365.6s)]
