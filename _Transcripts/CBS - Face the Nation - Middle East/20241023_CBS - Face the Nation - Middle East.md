# Israel-Hezbollah fighting displaces hundreds of thousands in Lebanon
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874)
*  Israel's air and ground campaign against Iran-backed Hezbollah forces have left hundreds of thousands [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=0.0s)]
*  of people displaced in Lebanon, including refugees who escaped the war in Syria. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=5.42s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Deborah Pata reports on the uncertain future they face [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=10.32s)]
*  as tensions run high in the Middle East. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=14.9s)]
*  Every fresh Israeli strike forces more people to flee in Lebanon. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=19.96s)]
*  On the border with Syria, many know this particular terror only too well. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=25.08s)]
*  More than a decade after escaping Syria's civil war to find refuge in Lebanon, they [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  are on the run again. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=36.48s)]
*  Like 15-year-old Mohamed Al-Aboud. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=39.2s)]
*  My family left because of that war, he said, and now we have to leave again. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=41.44s)]
*  Most people here tell us the move is temporary, just until the fighting stops. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=48.92s)]
*  But still, there are tearful goodbyes. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=56.64s)]
*  It's hard to let go when you are sending your child into an uncertain future. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=59.72s)]
*  Those who cannot walk are carried across after Israel blew up the road leading out. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  Huneida Al-Uyedat's daughter wasn't even born when she left Syria 10 years ago. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=75.2s)]
*  I'm trying to calm her down, she says, and tell her it's going to be OK, that things [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=83.12s)]
*  will get better soon. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=87.72s)]
*  It's not true. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=90.76s)]
*  These are words to soothe an anxious child. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=92.14s)]
*  Like everyone else, she has no idea when the war will end. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=95.4s)]
*  And already in just over a month, it's created a humanitarian crisis. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=101.34s)]
*  With more than 1.2 million people displaced by the war, inside Lebanon they are everywhere, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=107.34s)]
*  setting up makeshift shelters wherever they can. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=115.26s)]
*  Hussein Hamir's son is just over a month old. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=119.22s)]
*  He escaped attacks in the southern suburbs and has pitched a tent with his family along [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=122.58000000000001s)]
*  Beirut's popular beachfront. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=127.9s)]
*  This hasn't broken his resolve, only fueled his anger. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=130.78s)]
*  This is our land, he said. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=137.34s)]
*  We won't abandon it for Israel, America or the West. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=139.22s)]
*  Everyone tells us the government is doing nothing to help, which is why you see people [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=144.06s)]
*  sleeping rough in the streets. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=149.56s)]
*  It's been left to overstretched aid organizations and the generosity of strangers to step in. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=152.46s)]
*  Ahmed Soufan runs a displacement center for just under 3,000 people in Beirut. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=159.26s)]
*  He has a full-time job but manages everything here as well, from providing a friendly shoulder [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=167.45999999999998s)]
*  of support to ensuring there are hot meals every day. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=174.1s)]
*  We reached our capacity and we're already struggling, he told us. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  And if the war goes on any longer, then the situation is going to get even worse. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=184.96s)]
*  It's a hope everyone echoes, that the war will end soon. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=191.52s)]
*  For 14-year-old Zahra, even hope is a luxury. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=197.28s)]
*  I'm scared of dreaming for the future because I don't know if we will still live or not. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  Kids will be kids. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=212.24s)]
*  But their elders are worn out with worry. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=214.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm all alone, Zainab sobbed. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't like to cry. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  It's humiliating. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=223.32000000000002s)]
*  We didn't harm anyone, so why are they harming us? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  It's a question so many are asking. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=229.68s)]
*  Even those who have not had to flee, like Mona Jabour, are worried about the long-term [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=232.96s)]
*  damage the war will inflict. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=238.52s)]
*  People are going to hell. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=241.64s)]
*  What is your biggest fear right now? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  Everything's crumbling under our feet. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=246.0s)]
*  It's just a disaster to see that young people are being brought up on violence and wars. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=248.2s)]
*  And this is going to perpetuate new hatred, new wars. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=254.72s)]
*  And with no ceasefire incited, it doesn't look as if people will be able to return to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=259.96s)]
*  their homes anytime soon. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw4PCDa874&t=264.56s)]
