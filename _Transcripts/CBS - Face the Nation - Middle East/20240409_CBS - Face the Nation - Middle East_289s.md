# Biden condemns Trump's actions on Jan. 6, Netanyahu's Gaza strategy in new interview
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM)
*  President Biden is calling his predecessor the biggest threat to U.S. democracy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=0.0s)]
*  Take a listen to his latest warning about Donald Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=4.96s)]
*  What in your view constitutes the primary threat to freedom and democracy at home? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=8.32s)]
*  Donald Trump. Seriously. Donald Trump talk uses phrases like we're gonna [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=13.36s)]
*  eviscerate the constitution, he's gonna be a dictator on day one. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=20.32s)]
*  CBS News contributor and anchor for Televisa Univision Enrique Acevedo, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  who spoke with the president, is with us now. Enrique, what news did President Biden make [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=28.64s)]
*  in the interview? Well, we spoke on a wide ranging list of issues from his speech of his [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=33.76s)]
*  State of the Union speech where he talked about how freedom and democracy were under assault at [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=43.68s)]
*  home to the events of January 6th, but mainly about Latino voters. President Biden needs the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  support of Latinos, specifically in states like Arizona and Nevada where we traveled with the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=56.08s)]
*  president to see how Latino members of the Latino community were reacting to his message. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=63.28s)]
*  Their president Biden talked about issues that are top priorities for Latinos. Of course, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=70.16s)]
*  immigration, that's not necessarily the most important issue, but it has to do with identity, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=74.88s)]
*  access to healthcare, preventive care, access to affordable housing, like I said, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=80.8s)]
*  wide ranging issues. He also talked about when we asked him about that State of the Union address, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=88.96s)]
*  what specifically he thought was the main threat to freedom and democracy at home, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  and this is what he said. The idea that he would sit in the office, and I'll show you before you [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=101.84s)]
*  leave, off the Oval Office and watch for hours the attack on the Capitol and the destruction [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=106.8s)]
*  and the mayhem and the people were killed, the police officers who died and call them political [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  heroes, call them patriots, and saying that if he gets elected he's going to free them all. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=120.72s)]
*  So Donald Trump, that was his answer when we spoke about the main threats to freedom and democracy [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=126.88s)]
*  freedom and democracy at home. We spoke about the border, how he's been criticized by Republicans [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=132.88s)]
*  for not doing enough to secure the border. This after his administration spent months negotiating [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=139.04s)]
*  a tough bipartisan bill that dramatically increased border protections. So I think President Biden is [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=146.0s)]
*  trying to first acknowledge that he needs the support of Latino voters, that the road to the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=152.88s)]
*  White House, the road back to the White House goes through El Barrio, and that in order to get [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=159.36s)]
*  their support it's not just about economics, jobs, wages, it's also about issues like education and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=164.72000000000003s)]
*  even gun safety, which we also spoke about. We, like I said, traveled with the President to Arizona [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  and Nevada, but we also sat down with him in the Roosevelt Room of the White House and in the Oval [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  Office. Part of the interview was on foreign policy and we asked him about Prime Minister [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=185.84s)]
*  Netanyahu and the increasing protests in Israel calling for his resignation. I asked President [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=193.28s)]
*  Biden if Prime Minister Netanyahu was more concerned about his political survival than he [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=199.04s)]
*  is about the national interest of his people. This is what President Biden said. Do you think at this [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=204.96s)]
*  point Prime Minister Netanyahu is more concerned about his political survival than he is in the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=210.08s)]
*  national interest of his people? What I will tell you is I think what he's doing is a mistake. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=214.64s)]
*  I don't agree with his approach. I think it's outrageous that those four or three vehicles were [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=220.0s)]
*  hit by drones and taken out on a highway where it wasn't like it was along the shore, it wasn't [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  like there was a convoy moving here, etc. So what I'm calling for is for the Israelis to just call [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  for a ceasefire, allow for the next six, eight weeks total access to all food and medicine going [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=243.44s)]
*  into the country. So as you can see the administration, President Biden are trying to walk a very fine [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=252.24s)]
*  diplomatic line condemning some of Israel's actions, especially after the death of World Central Kitchen [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=259.28s)]
*  aid workers last week, but also trying to get the international community to pressure Hamas [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=268.56s)]
*  into a ceasefire and the release of hostages. Rike Acevedo, you covered a lot of ground in the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  interview and to get the interview we thank you for your time. Thank you so much. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_gyznbvmM&t=282.48s)]
