# U.S. officials say Hezbollah could attack Israel within 24 to 48 hours
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [August 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU)
*  Israel is bracing for an anticipated retaliatory attack after the assassination of two top [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=0.0s)]
*  Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=6.44s)]
*  Just this evening, the Israeli Security Cabinet met to discuss its preparations, and the top [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=8.6s)]
*  U.S. commander in the Middle East has been in Tel Aviv recently. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=13.24s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent and Face the Nation moderator, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=16.92s)]
*  Margaret Brennan. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=21.72s)]
*  So, Margaret, the leader of Hezbollah has pledged a response. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=22.72s)]
*  What could we expect to see? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=26.68s)]
*  Well, Adriana, U.S. officials tell me that Hezbollah may be ready to attack within the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=28.4s)]
*  next 24 to 48 hours. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  The question is the scale of what they do. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  And this is significant because, to date, Lebanese Hezbollah has been unwilling to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=38.12s)]
*  engage in anything other than these tit-for-tat rocket exchanges. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=43.78s)]
*  Those are deadly, no question. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=47.08s)]
*  But they have held back from engaging in a larger-scale war. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  The last time I spoke with former CENTCOM commander-general McKenzie on Face the Nation, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  he said that is the most significant thing he has seen to date, the decision not to engage [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=58.92s)]
*  by Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=63.36s)]
*  And that's important because if you look at the weapon stash that Hezbollah has, the CIA [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=66.56s)]
*  estimates 150,000 missiles and rockets. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=71.52s)]
*  They are the most significant militia Iran backs in the region. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=75.0s)]
*  They are the largest non-state military actor here. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=79.38s)]
*  And so if they do choose to retaliate and at a scale larger than what they've done, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=83.2s)]
*  it could set off escalation risk in a way that really concerns U.S. officials. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=88.52s)]
*  And so why did the generals say that they have been holding back? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=93.6s)]
*  And how is the U.S. trying to assess the risk of a larger attack? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=97.25999999999999s)]
*  I feel like we've been talking about the risk of a wider war ever since October and that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=101.82s)]
*  horrific attack Hamas carried out on October 7th that triggered this cycle. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=106.69999999999999s)]
*  But at that time, the Biden administration did step in and tell Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  successfully at the time, don't open another front in the north, do not go to war with [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  Hezbollah, which is far more militarily significant and could do more damage in a traditional [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=121.64s)]
*  military sense, and also trying to hold Iran at bay. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=128.0s)]
*  What's interesting is what we're talking about now is Hezbollah acting independent of Iran [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=131.96s)]
*  in an attack in the next few days. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=136.66s)]
*  So we're watching this with the idea that if the United States diplomatically can keep [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=139.44s)]
*  them sort of in a box by sending messages to Hezbollah through Lebanese officials, that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=146.72s)]
*  would be a diplomatic success if they can keep this somewhat contained. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=152.48s)]
*  But there's the risk here that if they get in this tit for tat, Israel could engage in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=156.04s)]
*  a war here that would draw the United States in, a war they couldn't finish without American [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=161.18s)]
*  support. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=166.56s)]
*  Working through the night for weeks now, months now, this all happens against the backdrop [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=168.92s)]
*  of ceasefire negotiations. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  Where do they stand? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=177.6s)]
*  What's the latest that we're hearing from the different parties involved? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=178.6s)]
*  So the ceasefire that the United States is trying to help sort of midwife here is between [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=181.64s)]
*  Israel and Hamas in Gaza. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=186.83999999999997s)]
*  But it has impact for the entire region. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  And that's the Biden strategy here is it's can you get at least a six week ceasefire, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=192.64s)]
*  the release of hostages that Hamas is holding, lower the temperature here in a way that allows [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  for all the militias in the region to take a step back. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=202.48s)]
*  But also can in this unique moment we're in, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu turn to the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  hard right coalition of his party and say, look, I just killed the political leader of [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=212.4s)]
*  Hamas and two significant Hezbollah leaders. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=217.72s)]
*  I'm ready to take a concession and bring some of these hostages home. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  He has shown that this is the argument U.S. officials are making behind closed doors. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=225.84s)]
*  It was significant to see today the president Biden sign on to a statement alongside the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=230.44s)]
*  Qatari and Egyptian leaders saying it's time. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  And in fact, August 15th is the date on the calendar. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  You guys got to get this done. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=241.32000000000002s)]
*  Bring the hostages home, allow for a six week ceasefire, and maybe we can extend this into [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=243.24s)]
*  a larger end to all fighting. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=248.0s)]
*  Hamas and Hezbollah are two distinct groups. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=251.84s)]
*  So how will this ceasefire with Hamas help keep Hezbollah at bay? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, what's interesting is it would provide an excuse to take a step back. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=258.64s)]
*  Everyone's beating their chest at this moment, right? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=263.68s)]
*  And what we hear from U.S. officials is that Hezbollah doesn't want a wider war. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=265.88s)]
*  Israel doesn't want a wider war. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=271.28s)]
*  But this escalation risk, you hit an area that has and has unintended consequences. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=273.0s)]
*  You can't really solve for that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=279.08s)]
*  You can get into a pattern. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=281.88s)]
*  And all you have to do is look at history here. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=283.56s)]
*  Hezbollah was created in the 80s after Israel invaded Lebanon. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  That was a pretty significant unintended consequence. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  If they can get in Gaza a ceasefire, it allows a lot of these militias to say we can pull back. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=293.44s)]
*  It allows Iran to pull back. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=300.2s)]
*  It interrupts this momentum. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  Yes, Margaret Brennan. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=303.76s)]
*  It robs them of an excuse. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=304.52s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=305.64s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0K1zmXSMlU&t=306.28s)]
