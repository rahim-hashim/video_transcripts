# "Environment is shifting right now" on Israeli hostage deal, Sen. Bill Hagerty says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [November 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk)
*  And we turn now to Tennessee Republican Senator Bill Haggerty, who also served as U.S. Ambassador [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=0.0s)]
*  to Japan during the first Trump administration. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=6.48s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=9.6s)]
*  It's good to be with you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=10.6s)]
*  So Donald Trump has this sweeping mandate, as do Republicans. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=11.76s)]
*  Do you see this as an unrestrained presidency? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=15.88s)]
*  I think this is a presidency that has a mandate like we haven't seen, as you mentioned, in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  36 years. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=23.48s)]
*  The American public has spoken loud and clear. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=24.52s)]
*  I think if you go back to your interview with Bob, there are a number of places where Washington [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=27.159999999999997s)]
*  has been out of touch with the American people. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=31.64s)]
*  You mentioned Ukraine. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  I think that's a great example. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  The American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=41.28s)]
*  You think about it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=43.84s)]
*  We've sent $175 billion of U.S. aid to Ukraine. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=44.84s)]
*  That's more than three times the entire annual budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=49.04s)]
*  I've been one of the few senators in the United States Senate who has voted and has opposed [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=53.88s)]
*  every cent of this Ukraine aid. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=58.52s)]
*  I've been listening to the American people. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  We need to focus on our own issues first. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=62.68000000000001s)]
*  And I've taken a lot of heat over it from Mitch McConnell, from the Wall Street Journal. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=64.84s)]
*  But this is what the American people spoke up and want us to do. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=68.92s)]
*  We should never have been in Ukraine. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=71.80000000000001s)]
*  It's a result of failed policies, failed energy policies, the failure in Afghanistan. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=73.72s)]
*  There's no U.S. presence in Ukraine. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=77.28s)]
*  No, but our funds. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=78.60000000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about the vast amount of funds. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=79.60000000000001s)]
*  $175 billion is a tremendous amount, as I said, more than three times the budget of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=81.64s)]
*  the U.S. Marine Corps. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=86.12s)]
*  The American people want to focus on fixing our problems here. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=87.12s)]
*  With the border's collapse, with crime in the cities, we've got to pay attention to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  American affairs. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=93.28s)]
*  So does that mean just cuts to U.S. military aid to all countries? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=94.28s)]
*  What it means is that we need to take a very deliberate focus on America first. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=98.56s)]
*  We need to be leading from a position of strength, Margaret. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=102.36s)]
*  As I said, we would not be in this position. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  Now what we have is an administration that's allowing Russia to sell at a $60 barrel cap. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=107.56s)]
*  The argument they make that reduces Russia's profits. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=112.66s)]
*  What it does actually is it subsidizes China to compete again unfairly against us with [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  an energy cost advantage. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=119.88s)]
*  And we keep Vladimir Putin fully funding this war in Ukraine. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=121.04s)]
*  We need to stop that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=124.56s)]
*  We need to go back to producing our own energy and take Russia out. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=125.56s)]
*  Interestingly, interestingly, I'll call this the Trump effect, but just in the past 72 [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=127.92s)]
*  What we've seen is the EU say maybe we should replace Russian LNG with U.S. LNG. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=133.52s)]
*  You've seen in New York City, we're not going to issue debit cards to illegal immigrants [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=139.16s)]
*  anymore. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  Migrant caravans are being broken up below the border and turned around. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  The UK has said we're going to step our defense budget up to about 2.5% all since President [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  Trump was elected. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=151.24s)]
*  Some of that was in process already, but let me ask you specifically on Ukraine. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=152.24s)]
*  So Hungary's prime minister has said that Donald Trump has told him he will cut off [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=155.36s)]
*  support to Ukraine. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  You are saying here, I think, in the new Congress, there will be no more aid to Ukraine. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=162.04s)]
*  I've certainly not voted for any aid. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  I know you haven't. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think President Trump will find a way to deal with this. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm not going to get ahead of him. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=172.2s)]
*  I'm certain that he's going to find a way to navigate this that's in the interest of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  the American people and will stop the carnage. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=177.44s)]
*  Look, what's happened in Ukraine is terrible. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  People are dying. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=181.68s)]
*  They continue to die. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=182.68s)]
*  But we need to stop this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=183.68s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=184.68s)]
*  We also are seeing this alignment of like an axis of adversaries, right? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=185.68s)]
*  You have Iranian equipment. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  You have Chinese equipment. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=191.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=192.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=193.86s)]
*  You have North Korean personnel on the battlefield. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=194.86s)]
*  So this idea that Ukraine is somehow divorced from the rest of geopolitics doesn't seem [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  to be bearing out. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=203.58s)]
*  It's a deep concern to some of our Asian allies, Japan, South Korea. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=205.34s)]
*  So how are you going to be able to do this without complicating the chessboard? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=210.34s)]
*  Well, I think it's become complicated because America has not been standing in a position [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=216.26000000000002s)]
*  of strength. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=219.92s)]
*  The reason is that Russia has been fully funded because of the policies that allow them to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=221.2s)]
*  sell energy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=225.23999999999998s)]
*  Iran, we had them shut down. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  Iran was broke. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  Now they're able to fund terror all over the world. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  We had a maximum pressure campaign. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=231.45999999999998s)]
*  In part because they have all these other adversaries that they're doing business with, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=232.45999999999998s)]
*  right? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=235.48s)]
*  China. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=236.48s)]
*  They were not able to do that under the Trump administration. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=237.48s)]
*  That's why we saw peace breaking out in the Middle East. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=238.48s)]
*  Without Iran being shut down, which is what we did under the maximum pressure campaign, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=240.44s)]
*  President Trump led this, we were able to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=243.72s)]
*  Everybody said it couldn't happen. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  It did. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  But in other words, peace was breaking out in the Middle East because Iran could not [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=250.12s)]
*  fund terror. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  As soon as the Biden administration came in, they stopped enforcing the sanctions. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  There were attacks by Iran during the Trump administration. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  Nothing to the level that we see here. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=259.2s)]
*  And the assassination of Qasem Soleimani. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  But on the Middle East, Israel's prime minister said this morning that he spoke to President [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=262.24s)]
*  Trump three times in recent days, and they discussed Iran and they discussed a peace [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=267.26s)]
*  plan. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=272.92s)]
*  Do you know what the content of those conversations was? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=273.92s)]
*  No, and if I did, I wouldn't discuss them here because that has to be navigated very [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=276.0s)]
*  carefully. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=280.2s)]
*  Well, one of the reasons I ask is we do have this mid-November deadline that the State [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=281.2s)]
*  Department and the Pentagon have set for Israel to improve the flow of aid to Gaza's two million [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  residents. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=290.84s)]
*  The UN says there is famine already or on the verge of famine. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=291.84s)]
*  If it is found that Israel is indeed violating U.S. law, would you hold them accountable? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=296.0s)]
*  Should there be consequences because they are recipients of U.S. aid? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=303.1s)]
*  Well, I've had huge disagreements with this administration in terms of how they've administered [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=306.42s)]
*  their entire policy. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=310.38s)]
*  But this is U.S. law. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=311.38s)]
*  It's not just this administration. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=312.38s)]
*  It's humanitarian law. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=313.38s)]
*  I think what we've seen just break out again in the past 70 plus hours since President [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=314.62s)]
*  Trump won the election. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=319.7s)]
*  Hamas is now looking for total peace. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=320.7s)]
*  So I think the environment has totally changed. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=322.94s)]
*  They've announced they'd like to see peace. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=325.22s)]
*  They'd like to see peace in Gaza. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=327.1s)]
*  Let's see where that leads. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=329.18s)]
*  Do you believe that there will be a hostage deal negotiated under President Trump? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=330.78000000000003s)]
*  I'd like to see what Hamas means by this statement. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=334.78000000000003s)]
*  But it seems that the entire environment is shifting right now because they see new leadership [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=337.42s)]
*  coming in. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=341.42s)]
*  And I'm encouraged by that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=342.42s)]
*  And I think we'll have new opportunities to, again, President Trump was able to deliver [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=343.42s)]
*  peace through strength. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=347.38s)]
*  I think that's on the way and I'm optimistic what it might lead to. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=348.90000000000003s)]
*  So one of the interesting dynamics we saw in this election was that Mr. Trump was able [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=351.7s)]
*  to in some ways successfully campaign and peel off Muslim voters, Arab voters, certainly [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=356.54s)]
*  in the state of Michigan. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=360.90000000000003s)]
*  You saw some of that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=361.90000000000003s)]
*  Do you think, and they were frustrated by the carnage in Gaza, as a result, do you think [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=363.1s)]
*  Mr. Trump ends up with more wiggle room here to perhaps hold the Israeli prime minister [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=367.94s)]
*  to account or does he just give a green light? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=373.70000000000005s)]
*  I think what President Trump is going to do is focus on the root cause to borrow a term [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=377.02000000000004s)]
*  that was used a great deal in the last administration. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=380.54s)]
*  He's going to focus on Iran because the cause of this, that there's Iranian funding and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=383.06s)]
*  training of Hamas, of Hezbollah, of the Houthis, that would have never happened except for [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=386.82s)]
*  the fact that they released the enforcement of sanctions. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=392.26s)]
*  But in terms of upholding international law and U.S. legal standards to recipients of [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=394.42s)]
*  U.S. military aid, do you think he will stick by that? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=398.74s)]
*  President Trump is certainly going to uphold U.S. law, but he's also going to make certain [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=401.54s)]
*  that our allies are properly cared for and that our adversaries are dealt with accordingly. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=404.62s)]
*  So I don't have to tell you this because you know Asia really well. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=408.9s)]
*  But five of America's seven treaty commitments are in that Asia Pacific. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=412.38s)]
*  The U.S. has exposure there in a tremendous way. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=417.08s)]
*  The last time Donald Trump was president, he talked about pulling U.S. troops out of [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=420.46s)]
*  Japan, pulling them out of South Korea. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=424.62s)]
*  Is that a priority now, reducing the military footprint in Asia? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=427.62s)]
*  I think that comes back again to the failure of the elite here in Washington, Margaret, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=430.94s)]
*  to understand how a business person negotiates. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=434.3s)]
*  Everybody's got to sit down and talk about what the options are. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=437.74s)]
*  We have been supporting military presence in that area ever since World War II, ever [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=440.82s)]
*  since the Korean War. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=444.65999999999997s)]
*  A significant investment on behalf of the American people. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=446.14s)]
*  Those investments were made at a time when these economies were collapsed. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=448.82s)]
*  They were developing countries. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=451.42s)]
*  Today they are fully developing countries. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=453.06s)]
*  It's entirely relevant and I think appropriate for President Trump to discuss within the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=454.86s)]
*  level of support. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=458.21999999999997s)]
*  But in terms of signaling strength, saying we might ditch our allies isn't exactly a [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=459.21999999999997s)]
*  positive message. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=462.74s)]
*  I think the message should be that our allies can and should step up to the extent possible [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=464.46s)]
*  to strengthen their own capabilities. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=469.21999999999997s)]
*  We're seeing it happen. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=470.86s)]
*  We're seeing it happen in Japan. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=472.02s)]
*  They've agreed to double their defense budget from 1% to 2% of GDP. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=473.02s)]
*  That's a positive development. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=476.62s)]
*  They're trying to work more closely with us. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=477.62s)]
*  I think in President Trump's administration they definitely will. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=479.46s)]
*  This is the direction that we need to go. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=482.41999999999996s)]
*  Same for South Korea. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=483.78s)]
*  Before I let you go, you are on a number of powerful Senate committees. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=485.46s)]
*  Do you think you're more useful to Mr. Trump in the Senate or would you join his cabinet [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=490.58s)]
*  if asked? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=495.02s)]
*  I'll just say this. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=496.02s)]
*  I'm privileged to have a tremendous career in business, but one of the greatest honors [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=497.09999999999997s)]
*  of my life was to represent the United States, the greatest country in the world, in President [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=500.5s)]
*  Trump's administration overseas. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=505.5s)]
*  It's also been one of the greatest honors of my life to represent the people of Tennessee [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=507.85999999999996s)]
*  serving the United States Senate. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=510.88s)]
*  Whatever role I hold going forward, it's going to be advancing the positions that President [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=513.18s)]
*  Trump has articulated that the American people overwhelmingly supported. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=518.1s)]
*  I'll do that in whatever role necessary, but we are going to see America strong again. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=521.98s)]
*  Senator Haggerty, thank you for your time today. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfSYHuw0jk&t=526.46s)]
