# Jordan's Queen Rania al Abdullah says U.S. is seen as "enabler" of Israel
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc)
*  This week, the King of Jordan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=0.0s)]
*  will meet with President Biden [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=1.8s)]
*  at the White House. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=3.5s)]
*  Jordan is a key ally of the U.S. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=4.8s)]
*  and for the past 30 years has [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=6.84s)]
*  had a peace treaty with Israel. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=8.64s)]
*  We spoke with his partner, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=10.74s)]
*  Queen Rania al-Abdulla of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=12.68s)]
*  Jordan on Thursday. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=14.58s)]
*  She's of Palestinian descent [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=16.12s)]
*  and an advocate for children. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=17.88s)]
*  We began our conversation [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=19.82s)]
*  on the impact of the war [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=21.42s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=22.96s)]
*  and America's role in the region. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=24.76s)]
*  People view the U.S. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=27.2s)]
*  as being party to this war [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=28.7s)]
*  because Israeli officials say [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=30.259999999999998s)]
*  that without U.S. support, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=32.14s)]
*  they couldn't launch this war. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=33.94s)]
*  You turn off the tap [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=35.74s)]
*  and the weapons dry out. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=37.04s)]
*  And so there's been anger [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=38.74s)]
*  in our part of the world, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=40.34s)]
*  not just what's happening, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=41.74s)]
*  but at the world's reaction. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=43.34s)]
*  When we see these violations, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=45.04s)]
*  human rights violations [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=47.22s)]
*  and international law violations, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=48.82s)]
*  and we're watching the world [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=50.78s)]
*  letting it happen, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=52.36s)]
*  when October 7th happened, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  the world rightfully condemned it [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=55.019999999999996s)]
*  and took strong actions, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=56.7s)]
*  took strong positions. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=58.02s)]
*  We are outraged that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=59.4s)]
*  the same is not happening [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=61.2s)]
*  when Palestinians are getting killed. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=62.36s)]
*  And so there is a sense [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=64.66s)]
*  of the selective application [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=65.94s)]
*  of humanitarian law [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=67.6s)]
*  and a sense of unfairness, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=68.64s)]
*  a sense of our lives [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=69.9s)]
*  don't matter as much. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=71.48s)]
*  You said people back home [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=72.94s)]
*  see the United States as complicit [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=74.84s)]
*  in what's happening? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=77.72s)]
*  They see it as an enabler, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=78.53999999999999s)]
*  you know, as so clearly [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=80.38s)]
*  the U.S. is the country [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=82.88s)]
*  that has most leverage [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=84.08s)]
*  over the U.S., [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=85.62s)]
*  over Israel. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=86.97999999999999s)]
*  And like I said, you know, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=88.08s)]
*  it is the biggest ally [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=90.88s)]
*  and the biggest supporter. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=92.66s)]
*  And the Arab world is getting, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=93.96s)]
*  the rest of the world actually [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=96.02s)]
*  is getting mixed messages. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=97.02s)]
*  So on the one hand, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=98.1s)]
*  the U.S. is demanding [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=99.05999999999999s)]
*  that more aid rightfully go back into Gaza. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=100.83999999999999s)]
*  At the same time, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=103.35999999999999s)]
*  they're denying that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=104.56s)]
*  the starvation is intentional. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  On the one hand, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=107.1s)]
*  they are outraged by the attacks [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=108.08s)]
*  on the aid convoys, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=110.83999999999999s)]
*  but at the same time, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=112.88s)]
*  they're denying that Israel [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=113.72s)]
*  is violating international [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=115.28s)]
*  humanitarian law. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=116.54s)]
*  There's an expression of concern [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=117.84s)]
*  over civilian deaths, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=119.5s)]
*  but at the same time, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=121.08s)]
*  there is a provision of offensive weapons [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=122.08s)]
*  to Israel that are used [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=125.42s)]
*  against Palestinians. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=126.58s)]
*  When you try so hard to thread the needle, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=127.94s)]
*  you can risk dropping the ball. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=130.18s)]
*  You can risk letting your values [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=131.86s)]
*  and principles unravel. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=134.12s)]
*  And that has a deep impact. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=135.56s)]
*  Either everyone is accountable [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=138.5s)]
*  or no one is. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=139.8s)]
*  So the next time a country breaks the rules, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=140.72s)]
*  you know, and the U.S. comes [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=143.36s)]
*  and tries to apply more authority, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=144.36s)]
*  those countries are going to say, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=146.08s)]
*  well, you made an exception here, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=146.88s)]
*  so why apply to us? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=148.86s)]
*  I think Gaza now is like a microcosm [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=150.3s)]
*  of our New World disorder, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=152.8s)]
*  of the breakdown of international norms, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=154.7s)]
*  of the return of might is right. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=158.06s)]
*  And I think that's very dangerous, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=160.86s)]
*  not just for our region, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=162.8s)]
*  but for the entire world. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=164.04s)]
*  Recently, President Biden, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=165.34s)]
*  just about a month ago, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=166.68s)]
*  warned Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=168.24s)]
*  that U.S. policy would change [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=169.88s)]
*  if Israel's behavior and conduct [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=172.18s)]
*  in this war didn't change. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=174.9s)]
*  Do you believe the U.S. is starting to use [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=177.2s)]
*  the leverage you say it has? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=179.6s)]
*  Well, look, there's definitely been a change [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=181.54s)]
*  in tone and language. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=183.14s)]
*  And you're right, the president has been warning [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  and has been trying very hard to persuade Netanyahu, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=187.72s)]
*  for example, to not enter Rafah. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=190.32s)]
*  But we've seen time and again, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=192.72s)]
*  Israeli officials not heeding the warnings [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=193.92s)]
*  or counsel or advice of allies. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  So I think it's time that the international community, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  including the U.S., [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=201.48s)]
*  really use this political leverage [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=202.68s)]
*  to compel Israel to end the war [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=204.28s)]
*  and to let aid in. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=206.52s)]
*  And it's by standing up for international law, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=209.16s)]
*  saying, for example, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=211.88s)]
*  the building of illegal settlements is wrong [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  and it has to stop. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=215.52s)]
*  It's by saying that we are not gonna provide you [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=216.72s)]
*  with offensive weapons. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=219.56s)]
*  It's by saying we're not gonna continue to use our veto [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  to not hold Israel accountable when it breaks the law. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=225.12s)]
*  Diplomatic pressure is also very, very important. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=229.88s)]
*  So there are many tools that the U.S. has [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=232.44s)]
*  in order to compel Israel to do the right thing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=235.2s)]
*  And I think for the sake of our world, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  the U.S. may be Israel's most closest ally, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=240.64s)]
*  but a good friend holds a friend accountable. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  You argued people need to understand [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=246.76s)]
*  that Palestinian mothers love their children [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=248.84s)]
*  just as much as Israeli mothers. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  Why do you feel like that needed to be said? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=253.6s)]
*  Well, because for decades, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=257.28s)]
*  the dehumanization of Palestinians [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=260.12s)]
*  has been an intentional approach that Israel adopted [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=262.8s)]
*  in order to numb people to Palestinian suffering. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=266.08000000000004s)]
*  It's actually quite surprising to see just how deep [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=269.12s)]
*  the undercurrents of dehumanizations run. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=271.96000000000004s)]
*  Arabs are generally accused of teaching hate, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=274.6s)]
*  and it's Palestinians as well. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=277.56s)]
*  But Israelis have actually walled Palestinians [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  out of sight and out of mind. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=283.0s)]
*  It's kind of reduced them to nameless, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=284.32000000000005s)]
*  faceless security threats [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=287.0s)]
*  that you have to defend yourself against. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=288.5s)]
*  To see Hamas as representing Palestinian people, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=290.1s)]
*  you're saying, is wrong. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=292.42s)]
*  Absolutely wrong. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=294.18s)]
*  And also just to point out that most of the people [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=295.06s)]
*  alive in Gaza today were not alive when Hamas was elected. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=297.9s)]
*  They were either children, they were not born, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=301.58s)]
*  or they were children at the time. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=302.9s)]
*  So absolutely Hamas does not represent [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=304.3s)]
*  the majority of Palestinians. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=306.22s)]
*  And if Palestinians hate Israelis, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=309.66s)]
*  it is not because of their religion or their identity, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=311.5s)]
*  it's because of the fact that they've only interacted [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=314.26s)]
*  with them as enforcers of a military state. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=318.3s)]
*  They have only known them through their checkpoints [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=320.06s)]
*  and bullets and guns. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=322.46s)]
*  It's not something that's inherently in them [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=324.1s)]
*  against Jewish people. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=326.34s)]
*  In fact, I always try to remind people [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=328.5s)]
*  that we have coexisted, Christians, Muslims, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=330.46s)]
*  and Jewish people for the longest time. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=335.58s)]
*  Well, historians will argue anti-Semitism [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=338.14s)]
*  has been present throughout history, right? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=341.54s)]
*  And it is hard for people to hear some of what you are saying [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=343.82s)]
*  and not react in that way, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=347.18s)]
*  where they hear a characterization of criticism [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=350.34000000000003s)]
*  of the Israeli government or the Israeli military, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=353.78000000000003s)]
*  and see where you're separating from Jewish people. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=356.66s)]
*  A lot of people don't hear a difference. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=360.1s)]
*  Anti-Semitism is absolutely present, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=362.14s)]
*  and it's been on the rise, it's been on the surge. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=364.9s)]
*  And it is the worst kind of bigotry, it is pure hatred. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=367.74s)]
*  And I always say that Muslims have to be [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=373.74s)]
*  at the forefront of fighting anti-Semitism [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=376.66s)]
*  because Islamophobia is the other side of the same disease, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=379.46000000000004s)]
*  and it's also on the rise. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=382.58000000000004s)]
*  Judaism is a religion of peace. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=384.86s)]
*  And the issue is when you try to conflate [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=387.5s)]
*  anti-Israeli policy with anti-Semitism, right? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=390.18s)]
*  Anti-Semitism is when you persecute somebody [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=394.54s)]
*  or you discriminate against somebody [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=397.70000000000005s)]
*  based on their Jewish identity. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=399.70000000000005s)]
*  Israel is a state, it has political policy, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=401.66s)]
*  political parties. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=404.70000000000005s)]
*  You can criticize the state of Israel, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=407.21999999999997s)]
*  but that's not necessarily anti-Semitism. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=409.94s)]
*  So when people stand up and speak against the war in Gaza, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=411.9s)]
*  when they're talking about the, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=416.21999999999997s)]
*  speak against the collective punishment, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=418.58s)]
*  when you deprive people of food as a weapon of war, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=420.26s)]
*  when entire population is displaced, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=424.09999999999997s)]
*  when there's discriminant bombing, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=426.86s)]
*  that is not anti-Semitism. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=428.9s)]
*  That is speaking against Israeli policy. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=430.38s)]
*  And I think it would be wrong to hold the Jewish community [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=433.58000000000004s)]
*  responsible for the actions of the, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=437.98s)]
*  or the policies of Israel. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=441.22s)]
*  How are young people in Jordan thinking about this right now? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=442.46000000000004s)]
*  I mean, what is the sentiment in terms of [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=447.1s)]
*  the American unconditional support [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=450.66s)]
*  for the government of Israel? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=452.74s)]
*  I have to say, in one word, there's outrage. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=454.62s)]
*  There is outrage because, you know, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=458.14000000000004s)]
*  for most young people, even those who maybe were against [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=461.1s)]
*  American foreign policy or whatever, or disagreed with it, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=466.78000000000003s)]
*  we always looked up to the US, you know, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=469.58000000000004s)]
*  as a country of, a democratic country with democratic values, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=471.5s)]
*  with application of law, with freedom of speech, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=475.78000000000003s)]
*  with, you know, human rights, et cetera. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=479.90000000000003s)]
*  And as I said, you know, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=483.26000000000005s)]
*  the young people are now feeling extremely disillusioned. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=485.1s)]
*  How can this be happening [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=488.02000000000004s)]
*  while the US is allowing it to happen, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=490.1s)]
*  while the rest of the world is allowing it to happen? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=492.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, the director of national intelligence in this country, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=495.26000000000005s)]
*  Avril Haynes, testified saying there will be [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=497.82000000000005s)]
*  a generational impact from the war in Gaza. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=500.06s)]
*  And that was also a gesture to terror recruitment. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=504.34000000000003s)]
*  How concerned are you that that is what may happen [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=507.66s)]
*  to some of these young people who you say are [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=512.22s)]
*  just inundated with images of what's happening? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=515.5s)]
*  It's not just the people who are on the extreme [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=518.86s)]
*  that are being enraged by this. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=522.1s)]
*  It's people who are in the middle as well, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=524.0200000000001s)]
*  people who are westernized, people who studied here, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=527.1s)]
*  people who are suddenly just looking at the world [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=530.74s)]
*  and saying, you know, they're so disillusioned. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=533.9000000000001s)]
*  They're saying, you know, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=535.9000000000001s)]
*  clearly there are different standards [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=537.0200000000001s)]
*  that humanitarian law is applied selectively [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=539.0200000000001s)]
*  and that our lives don't matter. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=541.22s)]
*  And that it's okay for, you know, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=543.1400000000001s)]
*  almost 15,000 children to be killed, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=545.98s)]
*  19,000 to be orphaned. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=547.78s)]
*  It's okay for, you know, the infrastructure to be obliterated. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=549.74s)]
*  It's okay to use, to stop the delivery of aid [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=553.54s)]
*  and food to an entire population. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=558.38s)]
*  That is collective punishment. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=560.66s)]
*  It's a war crime and it's happening. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=562.02s)]
*  And so the young people are saying, you know, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=565.1s)]
*  I guess the West doesn't like us. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=568.7s)]
*  So in my opinion, this is probably one of the largest [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=570.82s)]
*  recruitment events that we've seen in recent history. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=575.06s)]
*  What you are describing is what Defense Secretary Austin [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=578.86s)]
*  warned Israel about, that you could have a tactical win [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=582.3s)]
*  and a strategic loss in the long-term. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=586.5799999999999s)]
*  That's what I hear you saying, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=588.74s)]
*  that this will lead to more terror recruitment. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=590.06s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=592.46s)]
*  Is this war making Israel safer? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=593.5s)]
*  Is it making our world safer? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=596.22s)]
*  You know, I would argue after 35,000 people dead, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=598.62s)]
*  after the obliteration of the civilian infrastructure [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=604.62s)]
*  in Gaza, after the violations of so much, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=608.42s)]
*  after the rhetoric that we're hearing, you know, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=613.5s)]
*  from Israeli officials calling Palestinians human animals [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=616.58s)]
*  or saying when the prime minister says that Palestinians [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=620.26s)]
*  are children of darkness, that they only understand [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=623.0600000000001s)]
*  the rules of the jungle, you know, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=626.34s)]
*  when officials say we need to find a more effective way [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=628.22s)]
*  than death to afflict suffering on Palestinians. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=632.14s)]
*  How is that making Israel safer? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=635.22s)]
*  I mean, how? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=637.58s)]
*  Peace is not about politics only, it's about people. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=639.02s)]
*  Israelis are surprised when the word genocide is used [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=641.58s)]
*  because they cannot see Palestinians as anything [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=645.3000000000001s)]
*  but as a security threat, that they deserve [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=648.82s)]
*  what's happening to them. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=651.66s)]
*  You know, in a poll asking- [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=652.74s)]
*  They're traumatized after October 7th. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=653.78s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=655.98s)]
*  Many Israelis. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=656.82s)]
*  Traumatized, I understand that. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=657.64s)]
*  And I understand that because of my own background [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=658.48s)]
*  that I would identify with the Palestinian side more. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=661.42s)]
*  And I, because of that, I challenge myself every single day [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=664.42s)]
*  to put myself in the shoes of an Israeli mother [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=668.3399999999999s)]
*  who has a child that's been taken as hostage [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=671.42s)]
*  or any young Israeli who has been taught [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=674.62s)]
*  and who's heard of the horrible persecution [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=679.66s)]
*  that the Jewish people have had to endure in Europe. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=682.74s)]
*  And I try to empathize and see where they're coming from. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=685.6999999999999s)]
*  And absolutely, we need the hostages [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=689.9s)]
*  to go home as soon as possible. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=693.38s)]
*  And we need the war to end as soon as possible [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=695.02s)]
*  so that Palestinians can go back to their homes [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jabNlPQjc&t=697.22s)]
