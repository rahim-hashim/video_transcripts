# Takeaways from Biden's last speech on foreign policy as president
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4)
*  President Biden delivered his final foreign policy speech at the State Department Monday, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=0.0s)]
*  and the president said the United States is in a better position on the world stage than [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=4.16s)]
*  it was when he took office. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Right now, in my view, thanks to our administration, the United States is winning the worldwide [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  competition. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=16.16s)]
*  Compared to four years ago, America is stronger. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=18.2s)]
*  Our alliances are stronger. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=22.2s)]
*  Our adversaries and competitors are weaker. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=24.52s)]
*  We have not gone to war to make these things happen. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=27.4s)]
*  Biden also highlighted what he called his ability to rally a global coalition to support [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=31.64s)]
*  Ukraine in its war against Russia, his newly formed alliances in the Indo-Pacific, and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=35.56s)]
*  the fact that he is the first president in decades who is not leading a war in Afghanistan. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=39.92s)]
*  However, the president has been criticized for the way he ended that conflict. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=44.92s)]
*  For more, I want to bring in Matthew Kroning. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  He's the vice president and senior director of the Atlantic Council's Center for Strategy [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=50.68s)]
*  and Security. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  I believe Scowcroft, but I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that correctly. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  Please correct me if I'm wrong. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  So Matthew, do you think that President Biden has strengthened the U.S. position on the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  world stage? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=65.84s)]
*  Well, I think with this speech, he, like many presidents, is trying to shape perceptions [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=66.84s)]
*  of his foreign policy legacy. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=72.16s)]
*  But I think historians are not going to be kind at their assessment of the foreign policy [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  legacy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=79.6s)]
*  We have a major war in Europe, a major war in the Middle East. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=80.6s)]
*  Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon than it's ever been. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=84.28s)]
*  North Korea's nuclear weapons program continues to expand. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=87.12s)]
*  China is engaging in daily military coercion against U.S. allies. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  And these dictators are working together more closely than ever in what some are calling [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=95.04s)]
*  an axis of aggressors or an axis of autocracies. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=99.72s)]
*  And so some experts say this is the most dangerous national security environment the United States [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=103.4s)]
*  has ever faced, maybe in decades. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=107.68s)]
*  And this is the legacy environment that Biden's handing to his successor. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=111.0s)]
*  So on balance, I think historians, again, will probably not be kind when they assess [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=116.72s)]
*  Biden's foreign policy. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=121.68s)]
*  How do you think his fantasy versus reality was in terms of foreign policy goals? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=123.76s)]
*  The world is different than it was four years ago. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=130.32s)]
*  So how did his goals entering his term differ from where they are at the end of his presidency? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=132.84s)]
*  The Biden administration came in saying that they saw China as the biggest state-based [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=139.64s)]
*  threat facing the United States and that they were going to prioritize competition on China. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=144.04s)]
*  And to do that, they were going to put relations with Russia on a, quote, stable and predictable [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=148.92s)]
*  footing. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=153.56s)]
*  And they were going to pacify the Middle East by entering, re-entering the Iran nuclear [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=154.56s)]
*  deal. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=158.92s)]
*  And those things didn't turn out as planned. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=159.92s)]
*  Instead, we had this major war in Ukraine that continues to drag on into its third year, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=162.56s)]
*  major war in the Middle East. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=169.84s)]
*  And I think that's distracted the Biden team from a focus on China. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  Biden has said four times that he would defend Taiwan if China invades. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=176.64s)]
*  But after inflation, the Biden administration is essentially cutting defense spending. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=181.32s)]
*  So we're not really building the military to do that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=186.4s)]
*  So again, I think the idea was to prioritize China in practice. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=189.32s)]
*  They've been really caught up with these major wars in Europe and the Middle East. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=192.88s)]
*  National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan says the U.S. is very close to brokering a ceasefire [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=201.48s)]
*  We've been here before. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  We have to preface with that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  But if that is achieved, what would that do for his foreign legacy at this point? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, you're right. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  We've been here before and then Hamas has walked away. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=210.84s)]
*  So we'll see if it works out. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=215.0s)]
*  I think if it happens, it will help the foreign policy legacy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=216.8s)]
*  But there will be an alternative account that now these hostages have been there for longer [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=220.96s)]
*  than the U.S. hostages were held by the Iranians in 1979. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  And the hostages in 1979 were released after Carter left when Reagan took office. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  And so some may see this as a Trump success. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=236.96s)]
*  Trump has been making threats that there will be all hell to pay in the Middle East if these [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=241.16000000000003s)]
*  hostages are not released. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  And so the narrative may be that, like with Carter and Reagan, it was this transition [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=246.7s)]
*  that created the opportunity for the hostages to be released. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=250.92s)]
*  Matthew Kroening, thank you for your time. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=254.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfZffuyrRO4&t=258.21999999999997s)]
