# Trump claims some credit for Israel and Hamas agreeing on ceasefire, hostage release deal
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4)
*  Let's go live now to CBS News Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cortez [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=0.0s)]
*  close to President-elect Donald Trump in West Palm Beach, Florida. Trump now [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=3.96s)]
*  posting to social media, Nancy, about this deal. What can you tell us about that? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=7.92s)]
*  Well, he is claiming at least partial credit. Liz is calling it an epic [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=13.16s)]
*  ceasefire agreement and he is claiming that it could only have happened [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=18.6s)]
*  because he was elected in November. What he is saying is that the fact that he [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=23.68s)]
*  has been arguing for weeks that there would be hell to pay if there wasn't a [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=29.88s)]
*  hostage deal before he came into office next week. That he's saying that that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=36.76s)]
*  pushed the parties across the finish line and he goes on to say in this [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  statement, we have achieved so much without even being in the White House. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=45.36s)]
*  Just imagine all the wonderful things that will happen when I return to the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=49.36s)]
*  White House. Now I imagine the Biden administration would quibble with this [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=54.0s)]
*  characterization. They have been engaged in these very delicate on and off [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=58.44s)]
*  negotiations for months, but you're already hearing from Republicans on [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=63.32s)]
*  Capitol Hill like Senator John Cornyn of Texas who's saying it is no [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=67.88s)]
*  coincidence that this is getting over the finish line now with just a few days [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=71.94s)]
*  until Donald Trump takes office. Of course both sides trying to take credit [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=77.12s)]
*  for this, Nancy, but it's worth noting as Margaret Brennan brought up in that [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=81.0s)]
*  special report that this deal came together thanks in part to a member of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=84.54s)]
*  the Biden administration and the Trump team working together to get this deal [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=89.22s)]
*  accomplished. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=93.94000000000001s)]
*  Right. This was an unusual situation where the Biden team really looped in [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=96.7s)]
*  Trump negotiators from the very beginning, kept them posted on every [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=103.9s)]
*  twist and turn in this negotiation in part because the Biden administration is [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=108.22s)]
*  hoping to influence Trump on the Middle East going forward when he is president [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=113.26s)]
*  and the Biden team doesn't have any say anymore. They know that Trump views the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=118.46000000000001s)]
*  situation there somewhat differently than they do, and they thought that this [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=122.68s)]
*  was a way to kind of bring him bring his team in on the early side so he would [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=126.54s)]
*  understand some of the complexities that they have been dealing with ever [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=131.86s)]
*  since this war first broke out a year and a half ago. Yeah, no question that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=135.62s)]
*  the president elect is going to be taking credit for this in the next weeks [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=139.3s)]
*  to come, especially as we start to see these hostages being released. Any [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=143.66000000000003s)]
*  indication has the president given any indication on the other foreign [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=147.26000000000002s)]
*  conflicts that are happening right now and what he plans to do in those [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=150.5s)]
*  particular conflicts? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=153.96s)]
*  Well, he's made it very clear that he would like to see the war in Ukraine [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=157.26000000000002s)]
*  come to an end. In fact, Pete Hegseth, his nominee for secretary of Defense, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=161.94s)]
*  said something interesting yesterday. He said we all know who the aggressor is [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=166.5s)]
*  in that war, meaning Russia, going, you know, stating the obvious, but but [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=170.38s)]
*  going a step further than Trump is usually willing to do when he's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=176.38s)]
*  speaking about the war in Ukraine. He doesn't like to speak negatively about [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  Vladimir Putin or Russia, but we know that he is interested in some kind of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=184.7s)]
*  negotiated solution. And he he even made the case at one point that he would [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=188.9s)]
*  have this all worked out even before he enters the White House. That's [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=193.85999999999999s)]
*  obviously not going to be the case. He's being sworn in in just five days now. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=198.29999999999998s)]
*  But he has said that he wants to get this dealt with quite quickly. So we'll [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=203.29999999999998s)]
*  be able to watch and see if if he actually has a plan to do that. If he [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=208.73999999999998s)]
*  has a plan to bring the leaders to the table, something that they have been [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=215.26s)]
*  unwilling to do once he takes office on January 20th. CBS News [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=219.32s)]
*  Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes. Thank you so much for that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcxEXagjTD4&t=223.7s)]
