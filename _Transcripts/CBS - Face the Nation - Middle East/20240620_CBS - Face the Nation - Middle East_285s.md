# Tensions between U.S. and Israel over high-level meeting schedules
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo)
*  The White House and Israel are seemingly at odds over the scheduling of meetings between [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=0.0s)]
*  top officials, this time to discuss the situation in Iran. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=4.36s)]
*  Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, posted a video earlier this week claiming the U.S. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  was withholding military aid. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=12.52s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Karin Jean-Pierre fired back saying, quote, we genuinely do [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=14.56s)]
*  not know what he's talking about. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=18.64s)]
*  White House correspondent Nancy Cordes has more. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=20.68s)]
*  So Nancy, we've been talking about Netanyahu fighting with members of his own cabinet, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=23.28s)]
*  with the military, now with the closest ally to Israel. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=29.48s)]
*  Where does the relationship between the White House and Israel stand right now? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=35.52s)]
*  Obviously, things are pretty fraught. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=39.24s)]
*  And they only got more so this week when Netanyahu released that video arguing that the White [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  House was slow walking. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=48.84s)]
*  It sounded like multiple shipments of weapons to Israel, and that was making Israel's job [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=51.84s)]
*  fighting this war much harder. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=57.32s)]
*  White House officials, as you pointed out, Lana, starting with the White House press [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=59.4s)]
*  secretary said, we simply don't know what he's talking about. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=62.76s)]
*  There's only one shipment that has been delayed. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  It's been in the news for weeks. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=68.92s)]
*  Everybody knows about it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=70.88s)]
*  It's the shipment of 2,000-pound bombs. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=72.0s)]
*  We're still in discussions with Israel over that shipment. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=75.0s)]
*  But everything else is being processed on time and as planned. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=77.2s)]
*  So they said they didn't know what he was talking about. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=82.52s)]
*  Then the Israelis said that the White House was calling off a meeting here in the U.S. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=86.04s)]
*  with top Israeli officials over Iran. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  The White House once again said, we don't know what they're talking about. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=95.0s)]
*  But actually, our Margaret Brennan is reporting that that meeting did get postponed because [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=97.64s)]
*  U.S. officials were frustrated about what the Israelis were doing and saying. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  It's important to point out that Secretary Blinken himself is meeting with some top Israeli [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  officials this afternoon. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=114.56s)]
*  The strategic affairs minister, the national security adviser. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=115.96s)]
*  So communication goes on even though the conversations have been pretty rocky this week. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=119.08s)]
*  What was interesting, Nancy, is I think it was last week at the G7, Biden was asked questions [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=126.16s)]
*  by the press and he mentioned that the administration is prioritizing air defense capabilities for [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=130.48s)]
*  Ukraine over other nations. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=135.76s)]
*  I think he may have said something like everyone else can wait. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=137.6s)]
*  What is behind that decision? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=140.32s)]
*  We're also curious about the White House's response to Putin's tour of Asia. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=142.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=146.44000000000003s)]
*  So what White House officials are telling us this morning is that these Patriot missiles [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=147.52s)]
*  are being reprioritized, being sent to Ukraine, even if they were due to go out to other countries, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=153.12s)]
*  because Russia has been focusing on bombing not just the Israeli, sorry, the Ukrainian [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  military recently, but also civilian targets and energy targets. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  They said Russia has accelerated its attacks against cities and civilian infrastructure [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  and they're trying to destroy Ukraine's energy system. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=175.92s)]
*  They said therefore Ukraine desperately needs more air defense capabilities as soon as possible. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=179.44s)]
*  They said those shipments should start going out in the coming weeks and that countries [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=185.2s)]
*  are doing the same and that U.S. allies that were supposed to be receiving shipments of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  those Patriot missiles have all been alerted that they are going to have to wait. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=193.64s)]
*  Nancy, we're just about a week away from the presidential debate between President [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=198.8s)]
*  Biden and former President Donald Trump. You're there at the White House. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=202.84s)]
*  What are you learning about how they're preparing? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=206.24s)]
*  Well, we're not going to see much of the president for the next week until that debate [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=209.6s)]
*  happens. That's pretty unusual that a week would go by without much on the president's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=212.56s)]
*  public schedule. That's because he's holed up with his advisors first in Rehoboth at [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=217.48s)]
*  his home there, and then later today he's going to be heading to Camp David, where even [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=221.68s)]
*  more advisors are going to be joining him. You know, these debates and first debates [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=226.16s)]
*  in particular can really set the tone. And so they are going to be prepping in private [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=231.96s)]
*  all week long. They say that we should expect some surprises next week. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=237.8s)]
*  Not much detail about what those surprises might be. But obviously you want to, you know, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  you want to go into these things with lots of options since you don't know what the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=248.96s)]
*  questions will be and you don't know what your opponent will say. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=252.36s)]
*  Oh, and Nancy, I know we're out of time, but is there a response from the White House to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=256.16s)]
*  Putin's tour of Asia? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=259.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, the White House has said that it only shows how isolated Putin is when, you know, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=261.0s)]
*  he's there walking hand in hand with the North Korean dictator. So they're using it as an [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=269.56s)]
*  example of just how isolated he is on the world stage that one of his closest allies [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=274.8s)]
*  is a North Korean dictator. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=280.16s)]
*  All right, Nancy Cordes for us out the White House. Thanks, Nancy. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=281.8s)]
*  Thank you, Nancy. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxPz0Jcrzo&t=284.16s)]
