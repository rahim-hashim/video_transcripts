# Israel investigating whether Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ)
*  Hi, everyone. I'm Vladimir Dutyev. We are following some breaking news for you this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=0.0s)]
*  morning. Israel's military says it is investigating the possibility that has killed this man, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=5.76s)]
*  the leader of Hamas, his name, Yahya Sinwar. This would have happened in Gaza. If this [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=12.08s)]
*  is confirmed, this would mark a major development in the war in the Middle East. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=17.96s)]
*  So for more on this, I want to bring in CBS News foreign correspondent Ramin Essencio. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=22.12s)]
*  And to top that conversation, I also want to bring in CBS News national security correspondent [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=26.26s)]
*  Charlie Daggett, who's joining me from the Pentagon. Rami, let me begin with you. I know [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=30.46s)]
*  we're waiting word from the Israeli military. What are we hearing at this point? If they [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=35.1s)]
*  have not confirmed this killing, what did you first start to hear? When did you first [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=39.78s)]
*  learn that this could be a possibility? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  Vlad, hi there. Yeah, that's right. In the three p.m. hour local time, about an hour, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=45.78s)]
*  15 hour, 30 minutes ago, the IDF released a statement, in fact, saying that during operations [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=53.34s)]
*  that it was conducting in the Gaza Strip, that they eliminated three terrorists, three [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=59.08s)]
*  militants. And the IDF are now checking the possibility that one of those people was in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=63.7s)]
*  fact Yahya Sinwar, Hamas's leader and mastermind of the October 7 terror attacks here on Israel. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=69.3s)]
*  At this stage, we know that the identity of those men are still not yet confirmed. But [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=75.02000000000001s)]
*  the IDF has added that in the building where those people were killed, where those terrorists [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=80.78s)]
*  were killed, there were no signs of the presence of hostages in the area. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=85.1s)]
*  Now I raise this because the understanding is that Sinwar always surrounded himself with [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=89.17999999999999s)]
*  hostages as so-called human shields. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did tell the IDF [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=93.53999999999999s)]
*  to inform the families of the abductees that there were no signs of harm to any abductees [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=99.5s)]
*  in that encounter. Right now, we're waiting for confirmation that Sinwar is in fact dead. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  Charlie, let me go over to you. There have been reportings before this from many people [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=108.9s)]
*  who follow geopolitical strategies around the Middle East that if this man were to be [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=114.74000000000001s)]
*  killed that could bring about an end to this conflict between Israel and Gaza. So how significant [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=119.78s)]
*  would it be if his death is reported to be accurate? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=126.42s)]
*  Well extremely significant, because he has been the armed leader or the armed wing leader [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=131.5s)]
*  of Hamas for a number of years. As Remy said, the architect, one of the architects of the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=137.1s)]
*  October 7th massacres, he is very much in charge of the military side of Hamas. He became [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=140.78s)]
*  the outright leader of Hamas after the assassination of Ismail Kha'niya in August. So he is the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=148.06s)]
*  leader of Hamas and he has been driving almost all of the military offenses, including what [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  happened and unfolded in October 7th. And I can give you a little background if you [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=160.06s)]
*  wish about Sinwar himself. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=163.62s)]
*  Yeah, so he was born in 1962 in Khan Yunis. You know, the refugee camp we've been reporting [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=167.5s)]
*  on Khan Yunis, it's been battered in the Gaza war. He rose among military ranks to, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=173.86s)]
*  he became known as the butcher of Khan Yunis for the killing of several people, but including [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=181.9s)]
*  the killing of 12 Israeli soldiers. He was imprisoned in the 1980s. He was actually released [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=186.34s)]
*  in 2011 by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself in exchange for an Israeli hostage [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=192.54s)]
*  or an Israeli soldier that had been taken hostage. But as I said, he is very much the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  leader of the armed wing of Hamas and Hamas is an armed militant group and his loss will [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=203.82s)]
*  be significant. It's also worth noting that his name has come up a few times in terms [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=212.01999999999998s)]
*  of trying to figure out a peace deal that he may be able to get free passage out of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=216.9s)]
*  Gaza. But almost every Israeli military person he spoke to said that he would never get out [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=221.74s)]
*  of Gaza alive. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=226.94s)]
*  Yeah. And, and, and Remy, the question, of course, having both you and Charlie have been [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=228.38s)]
*  reporting on the ground since this conflict began back on October 7th, a little over a [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=233.62s)]
*  year ago, which is, okay, Israel killed the predecessor to this now leader, Yahuwah Sinwar. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=237.9s)]
*  I guess the question a lot of people are going to have, Remy and Charlie, you can jump in [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=244.9s)]
*  on this too, is in other words, you cut off one head and another one sprouts up to take [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=252.02s)]
*  its place. Is there anybody within Hamas that would take Yahuwah Sinwar's place or would [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=257.18s)]
*  this literally be cutting off the head of the beast and ultimately killing it? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=263.86s)]
*  Yeah, great question, Vlad. How it looks like is all of the, all of the leaders, all of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=270.82s)]
*  the names have been very public, very well known over the past decades. And that may [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=276.34000000000003s)]
*  be the question that Hamas is wondering itself, who is next up to lead if Sinwar is indeed [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=282.18s)]
*  dead? The shock is probably ripping, rippling across Hamas members across Gaza, along with [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=288.22s)]
*  the Middle East. But with his potential death, the mastermind of October 7th, Sinwar has [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=294.18s)]
*  long been at the top of the list of people to be assassinated, according to Israeli media. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=299.68s)]
*  It leaves Hamas without that leader for now, again, if he is dead. But for Israel, you [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  know, here it would also potentially allow Netanyahu to claim a major success after more [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=309.0s)]
*  than the past year of striking Gaza, leaving much of it destroyed. But also for Israel, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  freeing hostages still on the minds of so many here, about 100 or so believed to be [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=319.56s)]
*  alive and dead. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=323.88s)]
*  And I just want to share with you a couple of things from Israeli media, again, with [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=325.18s)]
*  the caveat that there's no official confirmation that Sinwar is dead. But from Israeli media [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=328.35999999999996s)]
*  right now saying that these three bodies that were found were found with large amounts of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=332.62s)]
*  money and fake IDs, the DNA and the fingerprints are now being checked. And that's important [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=337.24s)]
*  because Israel has all of this from Sinwar's time in prison and also from a year in hospital, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=343.12s)]
*  as Charlie just mentioned. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=349.4s)]
*  Some reports now are claiming that if it was Yahya Sinwar, he came out for air and IDF [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=351.09999999999997s)]
*  forces there, eliminated him if this did happen, probably thinking that he was just a militant [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=356.64s)]
*  at that time. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=363.0s)]
*  So, Charlie, I read an interesting report in The New York Times a few weeks ago that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=364.0s)]
*  suggested that Sinwar was not actually interested in reaching any kind of a ceasefire deal with [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=369.58s)]
*  Israel, that he believed that the longer he held out and the wider Israel's scope of [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  military operations grew, that he would be in a better position to force Israel to actually [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=382.4s)]
*  stop on their own without having to reach any kind of a deal. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=387.56s)]
*  So I guess, again, the question, now that if it turns out he has been eliminated, whoever [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=390.76s)]
*  is to take his place, would they be more interested in striking a deal with the Israelis? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=395.3s)]
*  I mean, it's a good question, Vlad, and it would be speculation at this point. But I [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=400.4s)]
*  think when we talk about the elimination of Sinwar himself, you know, when Ismael Haniye [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=405.56s)]
*  was assassinated in August, you know, ostensibly the political leader of Hamas, it wouldn't [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=411.12s)]
*  have an impact on Hamas itself. You know, certainly the chief negotiator in that would [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=416.2s)]
*  have maybe had an impact on the release of the hostages, but not in terms of the military [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=421.2s)]
*  leadership there. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  We also have to note here that it's not just Sinwar who's been killed. Over the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  course of the past more than a year, top-ranking Hamas leadership has been killed. So the second [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=432.22s)]
*  in charge, the third in command, fourth in command, they're all dead. So it will be [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=440.34000000000003s)]
*  a vacuum. Now, in terms of the negotiation, you're right. Yes, Sinwar, well, I think [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=444.38000000000005s)]
*  he realized that he was either going to have to fight to the death or negotiate from a [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=449.02000000000004s)]
*  position of power in order to try to find some negotiation. It wasn't going to be [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=454.38000000000005s)]
*  somewhere where it would be a surrender, as it were. So now we have to see what kind of [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=459.62s)]
*  this is going to have on Hamas itself, because the fighters are still fighting, but they [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=465.42s)]
*  have been getting clobbered for more than a year now. And he, as I said, he very much, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=471.46000000000004s)]
*  he wasn't a figurehead. This is very much a dynamic military leader within the Hamas [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=476.14s)]
*  leadership. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=479.66s)]
*  And yet, Charlie, we know that both Hamas and also Hezbollah in southern Lebanon are [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=480.66s)]
*  proxies for Iran. In the wake of all those assassinations of all those leaders, those [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=487.7s)]
*  leaders who represent these organizations, we know that the money and the materiel is, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=495.26s)]
*  for the most part, supplied by Iran. How does Iran fit into all of this, if it turns out [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=500.58000000000004s)]
*  that Sinwar has been assassinated? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=505.38s)]
*  Well, I think we have to pay attention to the fact that the relationship that Iran has [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=507.38s)]
*  with Hamas is not quite as close as it is to Hezbollah for religious reasons. They have [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=511.98s)]
*  backed Hamas. Certainly, they have armed Hamas. But in the case of Hamas, it's more been, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=518.9s)]
*  you know, the friend of my friend, of my enemy, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=523.74s)]
*  So at the same time, Iran will not stand idly by as they have not. When we saw the assassinations [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=527.82s)]
*  in Damascus and also in Tehran, there was a retaliation, a very large retaliation. So, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=537.58s)]
*  you know, we're also on the verge of an Israeli retaliation for the Iran bombardment that [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=545.86s)]
*  took place, where everybody here keeps asking every day, when is it going to happen? When [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=552.18s)]
*  is it going to happen? You know that U.S. forces are now on the ground inside Israel [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=556.14s)]
*  with another missile battery to prop up Israeli's air defenses. So this is cranking up. So, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=561.1s)]
*  yes, will Iran react to this? Almost certainly. They'll certainly have something to say. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=568.34s)]
*  Will they react militarily? Well, that's a wait and see. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=572.26s)]
*  Ramey, let me ask you about the point that was made earlier, that we suspected that Sinwar [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=576.3s)]
*  would have surrounded himself with hostages if the Israelis were ever to try to attempt [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=583.0999999999999s)]
*  to assassinate him. As you've all reported, it doesn't appear that this happens to be [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=588.66s)]
*  the case, the Israeli military saying that there were no hostages in this space where [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=594.18s)]
*  they conducted this strike. But what's the word on the street? Are Israelis perhaps, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=598.3599999999999s)]
*  I know this news is just breaking, but are Israelis, have they been perhaps heartened [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=603.74s)]
*  by the fact that if this man were to be assassinated, that that might be a gloomer of hope in returning [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=608.5s)]
*  some of those hostages, getting some of those hostages home? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=613.1400000000001s)]
*  I suppose the short answer to that is yes, Vlad. However, you also have to look at this [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=617.5400000000001s)]
*  through the lens of the constant pressure that the families of abductees have been putting [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=622.58s)]
*  the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. With that said, this potential, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=629.74s)]
*  let's say potential success right now if Sinwar has been eliminated, could very well turn [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=634.9s)]
*  the political table on that, in that Netanyahu could then say, look, although there has been [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=639.38s)]
*  a lot of pressure saying to stop the war, stop the destruction, stop the airstrikes [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=644.48s)]
*  on Gaza, Yaya Sinwar has been at the top of the list of the assassination sheet for Israel [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=649.26s)]
*  and its military. So this would be very much a massive coup, the biggest coup for Prime [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=656.66s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to say, look, a lot of you, many of you, most of you perhaps [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=663.22s)]
*  did not agree with me, but here there is this win, there is this success, and we will take [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=667.72s)]
*  it. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=672.4399999999999s)]
*  All right. Charlie Daggett for us at the Pentagon. Ramin Asensio reporting from Tel Aviv this [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=673.3s)]
*  morning for us. Thank you both very, very much. Again, if you're just joining us here, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=678.74s)]
*  we are following developments. The IDF in Israel is investigating whether the chief [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=684.04s)]
*  of Hamas, Yahu Sinwar, has been killed. We are awaiting confirmation from the Israeli [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=689.12s)]
*  officials. They seem to suggest that it could be that this strike that they carried out [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=693.88s)]
*  took out the leader of Hamas, but they are looking into DNA, which they have from his [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=699.12s)]
*  time in prison and from his time in hospital stay. So once we get that confirmation, we're [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=703.86s)]
*  going to bring it to you live right here on CBS News 24 7. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWWuVey7pyQ&t=707.68s)]
