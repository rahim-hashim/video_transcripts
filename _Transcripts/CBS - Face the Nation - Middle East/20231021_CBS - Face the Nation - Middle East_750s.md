# Blinken speaks after Hamas releases 2 U.S. hostages | full video
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y)
*  Over the coming hours, they'll receive any support and assistance they need, and of course [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=0.0s)]
*  we're very anxious to be able to reunite them with their loved ones. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=5.4s)]
*  We welcome their release. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=8.24s)]
*  We share in the relief that their families, friends, and loved ones are feeling. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=10.36s)]
*  But there are still 10 additional Americans who remain unaccounted for in this conflict. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=16.42s)]
*  We know that some of them are being held hostage by Hamas, along with an estimated 200 other [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=22.6s)]
*  hostages held in Gaza. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=27.46s)]
*  They include men, women, young boys, young girls, elderly people from many nations. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=30.86s)]
*  Every single one of them should be released. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=42.14s)]
*  Since the earliest hours of this crisis, the President has made clear that he will do everything [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=46.24s)]
*  possible to secure the release of every hostage. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=51.36s)]
*  In my own recent travel to the region, I emphasized the urgency and importance of this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=55.3s)]
*  to the United States and pressed our partners to do everything they can to help us secure [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=59.379999999999995s)]
*  the release. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=65.34s)]
*  Since that time, we've continued to work relentlessly with partners to do just that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=67.42s)]
*  I can't speak publicly about the details of these efforts. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=71.86s)]
*  I know you understand that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=74.74s)]
*  But the urgent work to free every single American, to free all other hostages, continues. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=77.12s)]
*  Gaza does our work to secure the safe passage out of Gaza for the Americans who are trapped there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=83.78s)]
*  In this particular instance, I want to thank the government of Qatar for their very important assistance. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=88.78s)]
*  When I was in Israel last week, I met with the families of U.S. citizens that Hamas has [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=95.74s)]
*  taken hostage. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=99.74s)]
*  President Biden, too, had the opportunity to hear directly from the families. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=101.89999999999999s)]
*  It's impossible to adequately put into words the agony they're feeling of not knowing [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=106.46s)]
*  the fate of their loved ones. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=112.26s)]
*  Worrying relentlessly about them, for their safety, for their security, for their well-being, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=114.82000000000001s)]
*  no family anywhere should have to experience this torture. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=120.58000000000001s)]
*  What I shared with the families, as the President did as well, is that the entire United States [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=126.46000000000001s)]
*  government will work every minute of every day to secure their release, to bring their [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=130.82s)]
*  loved ones home. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=136.94s)]
*  They have my solemn pledge, those who continue to have loved ones held hostage by Hamas, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=139.14s)]
*  that we'll continue to do that, working as though these family members were our own. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=144.05999999999997s)]
*  With that, I'm happy to take a few questions. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=150.98s)]
*  Matt. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=152.98s)]
*  MS ORTAGUS So thanks for coming down, Mr. Secretary. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=153.98s)]
*  I'm just – you said you couldn't talk about specific details, but I'm wondering [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=157.98s)]
*  you did thank the government of Qatar. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=162.45999999999998s)]
*  I'm wondering, since you were there, and they have an office, they host a Hamas office, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=164.3s)]
*  if you could elaborate a little bit on what their role was and if you continue to think [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=173.18s)]
*  that that channel there, them having an office there, is worthwhile. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=177.86s)]
*  And then secondly, a lot has been made by you, by the President, by other officials [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=184.3s)]
*  about how it is important for Israel once, if and when it begins a ground incursion into [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=190.34s)]
*  Gaza, for it to respect the rules of war internationally. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=197.86s)]
*  And I'm curious if you think that to date, even before that ground incursion has started, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=204.06s)]
*  if Israel is respecting those rules and laws. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=210.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=215.66s)]
*  I have a couple of other questions. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=216.98s)]
*  You'll understand that because this is an ongoing effort, an ongoing effort to get Americans [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=219.54s)]
*  who are hostage in this moment in Gaza out to secure their release, to get them back [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=225.66s)]
*  with their families, I really can't go into any details about what we're doing, how [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=230.5s)]
*  we're doing it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=236.22s)]
*  And all I can say with regard to Qatar is in this instance, we very much appreciate [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=237.22s)]
*  their assistance. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=242.1s)]
*  Beyond that, I really can't say because again, we want to focus on making sure that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=243.54s)]
*  we're getting those who remain hostage back home and with their loved ones. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=248.22s)]
*  That's the single most important thing. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=253.66s)]
*  With regard to how Israel's conducting its operations, I think you've heard the President [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=257.34s)]
*  speak to this very clearly. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=262.14s)]
*  You've heard me speak to this very clearly. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=263.58s)]
*  We've said – we believe strongly that Israel has not only the right but the obligation [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=268.42s)]
*  to defend itself against what – it's very hard to put into words the nature, the barbarity [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=273.26s)]
*  of the attacks. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=280.74s)]
*  And they really do have the obligation to defend themselves against it, to do whatever [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=281.74s)]
*  they can to try to make sure that this doesn't happen again. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=285.98s)]
*  But we've been very clear as well that the way Israel does this matters, and in particular, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=288.42s)]
*  it's important that operations be conducted in accordance with international law, humanitarian [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=293.78s)]
*  law, the law of war, as applicable, and that everything be done to minimize the loss of [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=298.58s)]
*  civilian life. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=306.06s)]
*  And we continue to focus on that, just as we're also focusing on getting assistance [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=307.29999999999995s)]
*  into people in Gaza who need it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  There will be plenty of time to make assessments about how these operations were conducted, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=316.7s)]
*  but I can just say for the – part of the United States that this continues to be important [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=323.14s)]
*  to us. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=327.22s)]
*  And again, it's what distinguishes us, distinguishes Israel from terrorist groups like Hamas, which [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=328.22s)]
*  not only have absolutely no concern for innocent human life, they intentionally use innocent [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=335.74s)]
*  human lives to hide behind, to use as – quite literally, as human shields, knowing that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=342.42s)]
*  civilians invariably are going to suffer in conflict. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=351.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=355.24s)]
*  MR PALLADINO. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=356.24s)]
*  Would you say, Secretary, just following up on that, Hamas has issued a statement through [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=357.24s)]
*  Abu Abaida, and I know with the huge caveat that it's a terror group and one does not [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  attach credibility to that, but they have said that all the hostages, the civilian hostages, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=369.36s)]
*  which include the Americans, could be released, that this could be the start of something [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=377.56s)]
*  bigger if there are no airstrikes. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=382.28000000000003s)]
*  Would this be a moment where if – under Israel's discretion, obviously, it would [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=385.16s)]
*  be wise to pause, to give it more time, to see if this is a moment since the ground invasion [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=392.32s)]
*  has not started, should even the airstrikes be stopped, to see if you could get more people [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=398.32s)]
*  out? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=403.4s)]
*  And it was notable, without going into details, that in the President's statement, he said [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=404.96s)]
*  – he expressed his thanks to Israel – to Qatar, rather, in partnership with Israel. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=408.91999999999996s)]
*  A notable connection there. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=416.64s)]
*  The obvious inference is that they were working together on this. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=420.2s)]
*  Does this give you hope that despite everything that's happened, that there could still [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=424.35999999999996s)]
*  be a broader relationship and avoid a wider war? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=430.6s)]
*  Thanks, Andrea. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=434.6s)]
*  So two things there. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=437.0s)]
*  First, it's very simple. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=439.6s)]
*  Hostages should be released immediately and unconditionally. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  That's been our position from day one. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=445.40000000000003s)]
*  It remains our position. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=448.08000000000004s)]
*  And to your point, I would not take anything that Hamas says at face value. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=449.88s)]
*  I'm not sure anyone in this room would take at face value or report something that ISIS [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=458.76s)]
*  had said. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=464.48s)]
*  Same applies to Hamas. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  Our position is clear. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  Every hostage needs to be released and needs to be released now. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=471.44s)]
*  There is no doubt from my own travels in the region that one of the important things throughout [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=478.96s)]
*  this very difficult period and since the unconscionable attack by Hamas is to continue to find ways [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=488.76s)]
*  for countries to cooperate, coordinate, when it's in their interest to do so. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=499.96s)]
*  And we'll continue to look to that. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  Any cooperation that we can elicit that facilitates the release of hostages, any cooperation that [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=508.52s)]
*  we can elicit that secures the provision of humanitarian assistance to the men, women, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=514.64s)]
*  and children in Gaza who so desperately need it, we work on that every day. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=520.08s)]
*  And I think we can say that we've seen some of that cooperation. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=527.04s)]
*  The broader question, though, I think is usually important because what's abundantly clear [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=530.4399999999999s)]
*  is the vast majority of countries, the vast majority of people want the same thing. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=536.24s)]
*  They want a region where countries are working together, where relations are normalized, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=546.28s)]
*  where there's greater integration, where people are working together, studying together, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=550.6800000000001s)]
*  traveling, doing business. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=556.72s)]
*  Over the long majority of people want that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=559.72s)]
*  And we want to see as well the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people fulfilled [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=562.0799999999999s)]
*  in the context of that kind of region. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=566.8s)]
*  And that's one vision, and it remains very much alive in every conversation that I had. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=570.1999999999999s)]
*  The alternative is equally clear, and it's very stark. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=576.48s)]
*  It's Hamas, it's Hezbollah, it's Iran, it's destruction, it's death, it's terrorism, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=580.76s)]
*  it's darkness. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  So the more we are able to make real that first vision, the more I'm convinced that [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=589.84s)]
*  that's the vision that everyone, or virtually everyone, will subscribe to. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=597.84s)]
*  So even as we are working through this challenge, this crisis, it's important to keep that [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=601.64s)]
*  vision alive because it's important that people know that there is an alternative and [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=607.52s)]
*  that everything that they hope for and that they aspire to is going to be best addressed [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=612.84s)]
*  through what I've just described, that first vision. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=618.04s)]
*  We'll continue to do that. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=621.04s)]
*  Jennifer. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=622.64s)]
*  Thanks, Mr. Secretary. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=623.64s)]
*  What can you tell us about the condition of these two Americans who have been released? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=624.64s)]
*  What is their health status? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=628.4s)]
*  And do you have any details on the condition of the Americans who are being held hostage? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=629.4s)]
*  Have you seen any proof of life on them? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=633.6s)]
*  And then on the rapid crossing, what is the holdup in operationalizing this deal, and [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=635.6s)]
*  will we see it open this weekend? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=639.8s)]
*  I can't speak to the condition of the two hostages who were just released. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=642.48s)]
*  First, out of respect for their privacy. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=647.3199999999999s)]
*  Second, because we haven't had a chance yet – maybe it's happening as we speak – to [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=649.3199999999999s)]
*  get our own team in there to see them, to evaluate them, and most importantly, to reunite [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=653.3199999999999s)]
*  them with their loved ones. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=660.3199999999999s)]
*  So I'm sure that will come out in the hours, certainly the days ahead, but I don't have [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=661.52s)]
*  anything for you on that now. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=666.3199999999999s)]
*  Nor do I have anything for you on the status of or condition of Americans who continue [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=667.56s)]
*  to be held by Hamas. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=674.3199999999999s)]
*  With regard to the rapid crossing, as you know, when some of us were traveling together [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=677.24s)]
*  in the region over the past week, getting assistance moving was among my top priorities. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=683.04s)]
*  And we worked very hard with the Government of Israel, the Government of Egypt, to do [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=690.7199999999999s)]
*  just that. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=696.16s)]
*  And we secured an understanding that we would develop a plan to move assistance. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=697.68s)]
*  That understanding was cemented by President Biden when he was in Israel and also speaking [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=704.68s)]
*  to President al-Sisi of Egypt. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=709.3199999999999s)]
*  In the time since, we've been working relentlessly with Ambassador David Satterfield on the ground, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=712.0799999999999s)]
*  working with the United Nations, with Egypt, with Israel, to put that into motion. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=717.68s)]
*  And my expectation is that you'll see that moving soon. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=722.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=726.56s)]
*  Thanks, everyone. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=727.56s)]
*  Thanks, everyone. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=728.9599999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaqmC-7X5Y&t=729.9599999999999s)]
