# U.S. envoy, Blinken visiting Middle East in another push for ceasefires
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLyhyPbQnNg)
*  watching our monitors for a big question coming out of the Middle East. And here it is who leaked a top secret document giving insight into Israel's highly classified plan to attack Iran. It's the million dollar question in international news on a Monday. So here's what we know right now. The only nations to have access to those documents. The U.S., Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Meanwhile, Israel not letting up on their attacks in Lebanon against Hezbollah. You can see the black smoke clouds right [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLyhyPbQnNg&t=0.0s)]
*  there. Today's target is money specifically targeting nearly a dozen financial institutions linked to Hezbollah. The president's special envoy, Amos Hoxdeen, is in Beirut for ceasefire discussions while Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be in Israel and other Middle East countries starting today, hoping also to try to keep a lid on this situation. CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Inosensio is in Israel with more on those crucial visits. Hi there. And we've been here before and many times in the past year. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLyhyPbQnNg&t=30.0s)]
*  This is Hoxdeen sixth or seventh time to Lebanon since October 7th. It's Blinken's 11th to this region and a ceasefire we know is still so very elusive with Hoxdeen, a U.S. official tells CBS News that he is in Lebanon to find an enduring arrangement for an end to this conflict. And today he met with Lebanese speaker Nabil Berry, who is aligned with Hezbollah and is an intermediary with the militant group. There's also a U.N. resolution that's being talked about. This is resolution [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLyhyPbQnNg&t=60.0s)]
*  1701 and it has been in effect since 2006, almost two decades. And it says that the Lebanese military should be the only military in Lebanon. But it has not worked. We know that because Hezbollah and now Israel are there. So we should look for any new agreements off of that. As for Blinken, he hasn't landed here in Israel just yet. But we understand that he is scheduled to be in the region through the end of this week through Friday. And this is all being seen as the last chance to get that ceasefire in [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLyhyPbQnNg&t=90.0s)]
*  before the U.S. presidential election. Meanwhile, here in Israel, police say that they in fact arrested seven Israelis and have accused them for spying for Iran. Authorities say this has been going on for up to two years with some of these people and that their own citizens had been gathering information on the locations of military sites, defense bases and energy infrastructure. That includes Israel's defense headquarters right here in Tel Aviv, the Kiriya, along with the Nevatim and Ramat David air bases. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLyhyPbQnNg&t=120.0s)]
*  Along with the locations of Iron Dome launcher. Israeli media are also reporting that they carried out hundreds of jobs for Tehran, got paid hundreds of thousands of dollars and that they are residents of the north and include for one a soldier who deserted the army along with two minors. And they're all being held in detention. Remy Innocencio, CBS News, Tel Aviv. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLyhyPbQnNg&t=150.0s)]
