# What to expect from new round of Gaza cease-fire negotiations in Qatar
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [August 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w)
*  Negotiations resume in Qatar today over a potential ceasefire deal in Gaza and the prevention [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=0.0s)]
*  of a wider war between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=5.2s)]
*  The talks include mediators from the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar, as well as representatives [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=8.44s)]
*  from Israel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=12.76s)]
*  A delegation representing Hamas declined to attend today's meeting. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=13.76s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Inosentio is following this for us from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=17.6s)]
*  Lindsey, hi there. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=21.92s)]
*  Even with Hamas not in the room, there is still some space for progress. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=24.16s)]
*  Just that the room has gotten just a little bit smaller. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=28.52s)]
*  And just to reconfirm, Hamas was in touch with CBS News this afternoon reconfirm and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=32.08s)]
*  saying that it is not sending anyone, quote, no one from our side is in the negotiations. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=37.4s)]
*  As for what Hamas wants, it has been saying all this week that it wants a return to a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=43.2s)]
*  proposal from July 2nd that it accepted, but that it blames Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=47.44s)]
*  for one not replying to and also blaming him for wanting to expand the war in Gaza and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=53.36s)]
*  then to expand the war across the Mideast. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=59.2s)]
*  They also blame him for being the biggest block to any kind of ceasefire. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=63.16s)]
*  But if Israel goes back to that July 2nd proposal, Hamas is saying that they could return to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=67.12s)]
*  the proverbial or even the physical negotiating table. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=72.36s)]
*  Now, the talks have started. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=75.6s)]
*  The governments represented are the United States, Israel, Qatar, and Egypt. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=77.56s)]
*  Qatar and Egypt, of course, being the mediating countries there. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=81.96s)]
*  US Special Envoy to the Mideast, Brett McGurk is one of them. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  The US spy chief, Bill Burns, another. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=88.32s)]
*  Israel's spy chief, David Barnea. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  Egypt's spy chief, Qatar's prime minister. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  And apparently the Israeli delegation has been given, quote, unquote, significant leeway [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=95.83999999999999s)]
*  from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to conduct talks. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=101.72s)]
*  And whenever these talks end, and we don't know when they will end right now, Egypt and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=105.5s)]
*  Qatar will then get in touch with Hamas representatives based in Doha to tell them exactly what happened. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=109.28s)]
*  As for the mood here in Israel as we wait for any kind of word out of these talks, for [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=115.64s)]
*  people who want a ceasefire, the words coming out of their mouths are our last chance. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=120.4s)]
*  Last chance for a ceasefire. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=126.26s)]
*  Last chance to get a deal done. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=127.8s)]
*  Last chance to bring hostages home. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=129.7s)]
*  The US ambassador to Israel, Jack Liu, earlier today said, time is always important, but [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=131.64s)]
*  time is particularly of the essence. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=137.0s)]
*  And now we don't know how many more chances we have to bring this negotiation back to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  a successful conclusion. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=144.48s)]
*  And Lindsay, tonight they're talking about a last chance march here in Tel Aviv, which [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  we will be at. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=150.92s)]
*  Maybe thank you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=152.92s)]
*  For more on today's talks, I want to bring in Natasha Hall. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=153.92s)]
*  She's a senior fellow with the Middle East program for the Center for Strategic and International [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  Studies. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  So today is a convening day, not a decision day. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to start with Natasha. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=169.96s)]
*  What do you expect and what are the sticking points for both sides? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=170.96s)]
*  Well, I think there's high level sticking points and I think that there's other more [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=174.96s)]
*  sort of technical, logistical issues at play. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=178.96s)]
*  At the higher level, you have a Netanyahu government who is heavily dependent on a far-right [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=181.96s)]
*  coalition that is firmly against any kind of ceasefire with Hamas and in Gaza more generally. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=186.96s)]
*  And that could lead to the collapse of his government and frankly the end of Netanyahu's [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=193.96s)]
*  government. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  On the other side of it, you have dozens of people dying every day in Gaza and you have [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  a movement in Hamas that also needs to deliver for its own people and is facing its own existential [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  issues when it comes to ceasefire negotiations. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  At the more technical level, you have things like who is going to control certain parts [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=215.28s)]
*  of Gaza? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  When is Israel going to withdraw? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=220.96s)]
*  You have issues regarding prisoner exchanges for hostages and things like that that will [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=222.96s)]
*  probably need to be ironed out as well. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  So Hamas won't be at the table, but they've been using Qatar and Egypt as conduits throughout [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  this process. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  So what do these talks actually look like and is the fact that they're not at the table [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  today going to impact anything? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I should note that Hamas was never meant to be at the table. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  Typically what happens in these negotiations is there are negotiations and then the meat [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=246.8s)]
*  eaters go to Hamas with sort of the deck of options. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=250.8s)]
*  And that's exactly what's happening today. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=254.8s)]
*  I think there's been a lot of reporting about how Hamas will not be present. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=257.72s)]
*  Hamas's basic external headquarters are in Doha. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=260.72s)]
*  That's where Ismail Haniyeh, the lead negotiator, was based out of and living before he was [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=264.72s)]
*  assassinated in Tehran. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=269.72s)]
*  So this is not sort of an outlandish type of issue or sort of an obstacle here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=270.72s)]
*  But what Hamas has said is that they don't want to iron out more of these details beyond [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=277.72s)]
*  the fact that Hamas was already negotiated on July 2nd through this sort of Biden-led [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  proposal. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=289.64000000000004s)]
*  And so that they hope that there won't be more sticking points that lead to a delay [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  in the decision making and a final agreement. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=294.64000000000004s)]
*  Very fragile next few hours. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=298.64000000000004s)]
*  Natasha Hall, thank you. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=299.64000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzApeS0v8w&t=300.64000000000004s)]
