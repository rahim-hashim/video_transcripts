# Shooting attack targets Israeli bus in West Bank
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [November 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU)
*  This coming out of the Middle East where a number of people have been injured in a shooting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=0.0s)]
*  attack on a bus near an Israeli settlement in the West Bank. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=5.2s)]
*  Joining us now for more on this, CBS News foreign correspondent Debra Pata. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=9.32s)]
*  Debra, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=12.6s)]
*  First off, Debra, what more can you tell us about this attack? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=14.66s)]
*  Well, Michael, this is what we know so far. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=17.6s)]
*  Israel's rescue service said a gunman targeted the bus at a junction near that Israeli settlement [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=21.6s)]
*  called Ariel in the Israeli occupied West Bank. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=26.94s)]
*  Three of the eight people injured are in a critical condition. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=30.220000000000002s)]
*  The attacker was shot dead by Israeli troops. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=33.58s)]
*  Hamas has now claimed responsibility for the attack, identifying the assailant as 46-year-old [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=36.38s)]
*  Samir Hussein. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=42.22s)]
*  Now, although much of the focus for the past nearly 14 months has been on the war in Gaza, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=43.22s)]
*  the West Bank has also seen a dramatic escalation of violence, particularly by Israeli settlers. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=48.540000000000006s)]
*  There have been well over 1,500 attacks by settlers on Palestinians. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=55.26s)]
*  Nearly 750 Palestinians have been killed either by settlers or Israeli forces, and at least [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=60.5s)]
*  24 Israelis have also been killed, Michael. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=66.86s)]
*  And Debra, you touched on the ongoing situation in Gaza. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=71.22s)]
*  What's the latest on the situation there? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=74.38s)]
*  Well, Michael, it's dire. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=77.5s)]
*  The situation there is really catastrophic. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=80.5s)]
*  Palestinians continue to face a relentless bombardment and a daily struggle to find bread, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=84.26s)]
*  to find food as the humanitarian crisis grows worse every single day. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=89.58000000000001s)]
*  Bread is a lifeline for Palestinians, often the only food they will eat for the entire [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=95.06s)]
*  day, and many bakeries have been shut down in the territory due to this desperate food [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=99.66000000000001s)]
*  shortage. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  Every day people queue for that bread, many go home empty-handed. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=106.34s)]
*  And today the tragic news that two children and a woman were crushed to death as a crowd [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=110.58s)]
*  surged to get bread at one of those few operating bakeries just underscores how desperate the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=116.3s)]
*  situation is. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=123.5s)]
*  The flow of food allowed into Gaza by Israel has fallen to nearly its lowest level of this [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=124.86s)]
*  in nearly 14-month-old war, and that's according to Israeli official figures, Michael. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=130.46s)]
*  And at the same time we're following the situation to the north, is Israel's ceasefire with Hezbollah [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=137.22s)]
*  in Lebanon holding? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=141.62s)]
*  Well, it's early days. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=143.42000000000002s)]
*  The guns went silent in the early hours of Wednesday morning. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=146.42000000000002s)]
*  Hezbollah's leader, Naim Qassem, spoke for the first time since the truce, saying it [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=150.34s)]
*  was a bigger victory than the agreement in 2006 which ended that war with Israel. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=155.02s)]
*  But since that truce began, it does appear to be holding despite accusations of violations [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=162.66s)]
*  on both sides. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=167.86s)]
*  The Lebanese army has claimed that Israel has breached the ceasefire several times while [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=169.22s)]
*  Israel says it struck a facility used by Hezbollah to store rockets yesterday and another rocket [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=175.58s)]
*  launcher was hit today. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=182.26s)]
*  Israel retained the right to retaliate if attacked by Hezbollah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=184.34s)]
*  I think this back and forth, the accusations really underscore just how fragile this ceasefire [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=188.62s)]
*  is. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=195.22s)]
*  It's a 60-day truce and the hope is that it will lead to a lasting cessation of hostilities, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=196.22s)]
*  but it's going to be tense for the next two months as people wait to see whether it has [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=203.57999999999998s)]
*  indeed held. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=208.9s)]
*  And I think for Lebanese people in particular, although Naim Qassem has said that Hezbollah [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=210.57999999999998s)]
*  has claimed a huge victory from this, for many Lebanese civilians, the initial euphoria [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=216.10000000000002s)]
*  of that ceasefire has given way to a very bitter reality. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=220.98000000000002s)]
*  Many of those who have returned to the south have found that peace has come at a heavy [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=225.10000000000002s)]
*  price. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  It's been built on the top of the rubble and ruins of places that they once called home, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=230.14000000000001s)]
*  Michael. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=235.54000000000002s)]
*  All right, Deborah Pata in Jerusalem, thank you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsstRnzd4HU&t=236.54000000000002s)]
