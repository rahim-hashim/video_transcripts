# Israeli ambassador to U.S. discusses state of conflict with Iran
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w)
*  I'm gonna walk over to the conversation corner now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=0.0s)]
*  because I'm gonna be joined by the Israeli Ambassador [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=2.16s)]
*  of the United States, Michael Leiter, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=5.12s)]
*  as Kyle and Inja bring the touchscreen closer here [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  to the conversation corner. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=11.8s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, it's great to have you with us. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=12.8s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=14.52s)]
*  Let me ask you what I think is a kind of threshold. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=16.54s)]
*  Thank you, Major. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=18.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=19.8s)]
*  A threshold question. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=20.62s)]
*  Can Israel, by itself, sufficiently degrade [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=22.84s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program to the place where it can feel safe? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=27.96s)]
*  Well, we believe we can. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=35.34s)]
*  We believe we have to. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  For us, this is an existential issue. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=38.0s)]
*  It's to be or not to be, and we've chosen to be. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=40.0s)]
*  So we're going to do everything we can [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=42.88s)]
*  to eliminate the threat to our survival. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=46.0s)]
*  A nuclear bomb in the hands of the Iranian mullahs [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=49.32s)]
*  is a threat to our survival. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=52.92s)]
*  Ballistic missiles, tens of thousands of ballistic missiles [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=54.78s)]
*  with the potential of our nuclear warhead [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=57.34s)]
*  is a threat to our survival. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  We've got to do whatever we can [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=61.580000000000005s)]
*  to prevent that from happening. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=63.42s)]
*  Analysts have said that it's not possible for Israel [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=65.66s)]
*  to get to some of the most underground and buried parts [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=69.30000000000001s)]
*  of the Iranian nuclear program, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=73.98s)]
*  and that to sufficiently, and for a long period of time, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=76.26s)]
*  degrade or destroy that nuclear program, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=80.82000000000001s)]
*  Israel would have to have US assistance specifically [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=82.94s)]
*  to get to the nuclear nuclear program. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=88.1s)]
*  And Ed O'Keefe, my colleague at the White House, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=90.3s)]
*  just mentioned this bunker busting bombs. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=92.1s)]
*  Is that not true? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=95.46s)]
*  Well, you know, that's the big subject of the day, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=98.9s)]
*  but I'm not going to go there. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=101.06s)]
*  Analysts said for many years that we couldn't eliminate [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=102.58s)]
*  the surface-to-surface missiles, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=106.78s)]
*  the surface-to-air missiles, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=109.7s)]
*  we couldn't get through the Iranian defenses, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=111.14s)]
*  we couldn't possibly deal with the IRGC. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=113.86s)]
*  And he has no nuclear scientists to left. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=117.25999999999999s)]
*  He can't see them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=121.1s)]
*  He looks to his right, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=122.25999999999999s)]
*  and he has no generals left in the IRGC. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=123.14s)]
*  This terrorist infrastructure is crumbling, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=125.78s)]
*  it's coming down, we're bringing it down day after day, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=127.97999999999999s)]
*  we're ahead of schedule. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=130.14s)]
*  And I think we still have a few surprises [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=131.26s)]
*  up our sleeves as well. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=133.45999999999998s)]
*  Don't underestimate the power of the Israel Air Force [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=135.34s)]
*  and the ingenuity of our defense industry. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=138.66s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, you just mentioned surprises [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=142.38s)]
*  up your sleeve. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=145.58s)]
*  Either yesterday or earlier this morning, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=147.38000000000002s)]
*  trust me, things move fast, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=149.26000000000002s)]
*  I know you know that as well as I do. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=150.5s)]
*  You mentioned that the world may see something [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=152.86s)]
*  more sophisticated in Iran than what it saw in Lebanon, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=155.3s)]
*  with beepers taking out significant leaders within Hezbollah. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=159.10000000000002s)]
*  Were you referring to something that has already happened, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=163.98000000000002s)]
*  or something that may happen in the future? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=166.38000000000002s)]
*  No, I was referring actually to what has already happened. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=170.58s)]
*  Thursday night when we began the operation, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=173.82s)]
*  we had simultaneous attacks that nobody foresaw, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=176.54s)]
*  and nobody really understands how it was done, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=180.54s)]
*  how it was accomplished. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=183.54s)]
*  And I said that in the coming days and weeks [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=184.9s)]
*  when the dust settles on this war, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=188.74s)]
*  and we've achieved our goal of neutralizing [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=191.38s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=194.06s)]
*  the world is gonna see just how, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=197.94s)]
*  the extent of our ingenuity. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  And just as it took some time to understand [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=201.9s)]
*  how the beeper operation was carried out, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=205.54s)]
*  how we carried out last Thursday night [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=208.26s)]
*  is also going to be studied, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=209.98s)]
*  and I think it's gonna wow a lot of people. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=212.26s)]
*  I'm a kind of simple person, Mr. Ambassador, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=215.98s)]
*  and it's impossible for me to imagine [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=218.22s)]
*  how Israel could have achieved what you just outlined [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=220.22s)]
*  inside Iran without people willingly turning their back [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=223.1s)]
*  on the existing leadership and assisting Israel. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=228.26s)]
*  That has to be true at some level. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=232.5s)]
*  You're gonna either confirm or deny that, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=235.14s)]
*  but that suggests to me there is something possibly rickety [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=236.9s)]
*  in new ways about the Iranian theocratic leadership. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=240.28s)]
*  Do you believe that to be true? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=244.06s)]
*  Well, Major, we know it to be true. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=247.85999999999999s)]
*  You know, Prime Minister Netanyahu sends a video message [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=249.7s)]
*  to the Iranian people every other Friday. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=254.22s)]
*  It receives millions and millions of responses. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=256.98s)]
*  The people of Iran want freedom, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=260.54s)]
*  and it's no surprise that there would be people [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=262.7s)]
*  who would cooperate with us for many, many years. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=264.9s)]
*  You know, if only the opposition in Iran could get together [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=269.18s)]
*  and express themselves. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=272.34s)]
*  We're dealing with a horrific theocratic regime [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=274.02s)]
*  that suppresses dissent. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=277.7s)]
*  You know, we've got 15,000 political prisoners [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=279.08s)]
*  in the Ayatollah's prisons. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=282.58s)]
*  That's just an astounding figure. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, this is back into the Middle Ages [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  where they have thrust Iran. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=289.0s)]
*  Iran is a very creative, the Iranians are a creative people [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=290.12s)]
*  with a marvelous history and tremendous potential. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=293.68s)]
*  And the vast majority wanna live with us [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=298.20000000000005s)]
*  and their neighbors in peace. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=300.56s)]
*  I think if the outcome of this operation [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  against the nuclear program is successful [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=307.20000000000005s)]
*  and we facilitate the Iranian people to rise up [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=310.26000000000005s)]
*  and choose a different government, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=314.23999999999995s)]
*  I think it'll be a great accomplishment [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=316.2s)]
*  and history will be kind to us [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=319.4s)]
*  for helping to facilitate that happening. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=320.79999999999995s)]
*  It's not our agenda, that's not our goal. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=322.68s)]
*  Our goal is not regime change. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=325.21999999999997s)]
*  Our goal is to secure our future [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=326.52s)]
*  and terminate this malevolent intent [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=329.2s)]
*  on the part of the Mullah regime. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=332.08s)]
*  But if it happens, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=334.29999999999995s)]
*  we're certainly going to celebrate that outcome. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=335.47999999999996s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, you've been kind enough [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  to stay for our next segment. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=339.24s)]
*  Please hold on. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  We're gonna do a couple of commercial breaks, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=341.32s)]
*  pay a couple of bills. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=342.47999999999996s)]
*  We'll be back on the other side of this conversation [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=344.21999999999997s)]
*  with more with our ambassador from Israel [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=345.38s)]
*  to United States, Michael Leiter. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlAGheo4J5w&t=347.9s)]
