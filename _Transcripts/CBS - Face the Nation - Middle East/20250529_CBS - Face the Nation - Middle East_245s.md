# U.S. and Israel waiting on Hamas to respond to ceasefire proposal, White House says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0)
*  White House press secretary Caroline Levitt says Israel has accepted a U.S.-backed proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=0.0s)]
*  Special Envoy Witkoff and the president submitted a ceasefire proposal to Hamas that Israel backed and supported. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=9.0s)]
*  Israel signed off on this proposal before it was sent to Hamas. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=16.0s)]
*  I can also confirm that those discussions are continuing, and we hope that a ceasefire in Gaza will take place so we can return all of the hostages home. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=19.0s)]
*  Levitt went on to say to her knowledge Hamas has not agreed to it yet. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=28.0s)]
*  An Israeli official previously told CBS News the ceasefire would last 60 days. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=32.0s)]
*  CBS News contributor Robert Berger has the latest from Jerusalem. Robert, what are you hearing? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=36.0s)]
*  Well, here's what we know about the proposal. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=41.0s)]
*  According to Israeli media, Arab media and others, five living Israeli hostages would be released on the first day of a 60-day ceasefire, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=44.0s)]
*  and another five living hostages about a week later. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=55.0s)]
*  That's 10 living hostages, which is about half of those hostages who are still alive in Gaza. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=59.0s)]
*  Also, during the 60-day period, 18 bodies of deceased hostages would be returned to Israel, which is about half of the dead hostages. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=67.0s)]
*  In return, Israel will free more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, including 125 serving life sentences for deadly terrorist attacks against Israelis. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=78.0s)]
*  And so, Robert, to your knowledge, in this first 60 days, it would only involve the release of 10 living hostages. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=91.0s)]
*  Right. So this has been the dilemma all along, because there are going to be another 10 or 11 or 12 living hostages left in Gaza, including Israeli soldiers. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=98.0s)]
*  And, of course, that's torture for the families. A lot of families are going to be relieved if they get their loved ones back. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=111.0s)]
*  But this has been the criticism of these partial deals, because it's good for some of the hostages, but not all of them. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=119.0s)]
*  Possibly. In Israeli circles, Mohammed Sinwar, who was the de facto leader of Hamas after his brother Yahya was assassinated last year, was considered even more radical than Yahya Sinwar. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=135.0s)]
*  And also an obstacle to a hostage deal. So the hope is that now Hamas and everybody's waiting for their response, that they'll agree to this ceasefire. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=148.0s)]
*  The World Food Program says multiple people were killed and injured as crowds of hungry Palestinians broke into a UN aid warehouse in Gaza. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=160.0s)]
*  Can you break down the current situation in Gaza and how this new aid organization, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation Rollout, has been? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=168.0s)]
*  So this Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is an Israeli and US-backed NGO that basically its goal is to bypass Hamas. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=176.0s)]
*  Israel accuses the UN and other organizations of allowing Hamas to seize some of the aid that's been going into Gaza. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=186.0s)]
*  So the idea was to bypass Hamas and get food to the people. But it's been off to a rough start. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=195.0s)]
*  On Tuesday, thousands of Palestinians stormed into one of the distribution points, seizing the food there. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=201.0s)]
*  And then yesterday, a UN warehouse was raided by hungry crowds. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=208.0s)]
*  Today, actually, according to the organization, things actually went better, distributing about a million meals today. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=215.0s)]
*  But the UN and other legacy aid organizations say that this has sort of been doomed from the beginning. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=224.0s)]
*  Not enough aid is getting in just to trickle, according to them. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=233.0s)]
*  And they also accuse Israel of using hunger as a weapon of war. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=237.0s)]
*  All right, Robert Berger, thank you. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-XccMt_-y0&t=243.0s)]
