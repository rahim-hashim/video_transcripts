# What Trump has said about U.S. military operation in Iran
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0)
*  We're following breaking news out of the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump announced that the U.S. has attacked three nuclear sites in Iran. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=9.64s)]
*  In a post on Truth Social, he called the attack successful and says the planes are now outside [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=14.22s)]
*  of Iranian airspace. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=20.1s)]
*  Mr. Trump went on to write, quote, Now is the time for peace. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=22.1s)]
*  He also says he will address the United States from the White House at 10 p.m. Eastern time. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=27.580000000000002s)]
*  This is the Truth Social message that he put out. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=34.02s)]
*  Right now we do have CBS News senior White House correspondent, Weijia Jiang, joining [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=38.34s)]
*  us right now with the very latest. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=44.68000000000001s)]
*  Weijia. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=46.78s)]
*  Carissa, we are waiting for the president to speak in just about one hour. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=47.78s)]
*  And certainly there are so many questions about how this was carried out and about [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=54.14s)]
*  the plans that led up to it, because, of course, as we have been reporting, it was just on [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=60.02s)]
*  Thursday that he declared a self-imposed two week deadline for Iran to really have another [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=65.62s)]
*  chance, a final chance at diplomacy and trying to give them an off ramp. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=72.86s)]
*  Of course, that now appears like it was a ruse to give the Pentagon time to get its [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=77.82s)]
*  assets in order in order to take out this massive, unprecedented operation. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=83.66s)]
*  I say that because earlier this week we interviewed the former secretary of the Air Force under [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=89.13999999999999s)]
*  the Biden administration, who said this particular bomb has never actually been used in practice. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=95.22s)]
*  It is a bunker buster bomb, an MOP that has really been tested and it was designed for [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=102.62s)]
*  a mission like this to take out a nuclear site like for Dow, which we've also been reporting [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=110.34s)]
*  on because it is its primary nuclear site right now for the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=116.66000000000001s)]
*  And so there are a lot of outstanding questions, not only about the actual attack, but also [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=123.46000000000001s)]
*  about the implications afterward. Of course, you said in that president's post that he is [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=130.89999999999998s)]
*  now calling for peace, but it is almost unimaginable that there will not be retaliation on the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=135.98s)]
*  part of the Iranians who have made crystal clear leading up to this that if the U.S. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=142.14s)]
*  were to involve themselves militarily and join Iran in its efforts to strike nuclear [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=147.5s)]
*  sites, that there would be consequences, forceful ones. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=152.89999999999998s)]
*  And so at this hour we are waiting to learn more from the region and certainly from [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=156.98000000000002s)]
*  President Trump, who again is supposed to speak in less than an hour now here at the White [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=164.06s)]
*  House. He just returned from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey a few hours ago. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=169.1s)]
*  He did walk by a group of reporters and he sort of waved and gave his normal fist pump, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=175.06s)]
*  but walked right into the White House without saying a word. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=180.5s)]
*  And so we will wait to see what he has to say. But this is a massive development because [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=185.42s)]
*  he had been signaling that there was still hope for diplomacy, which obviously was not the case. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=194.06s)]
*  reaction from lawmakers on Capitol Hill so far? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=202.5s)]
*  Well, it really depends. It's pouring in. So there are hawks that have been pushing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=207.1s)]
*  for this sort of response because this is not a new issue. Administrations for decades [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=214.82s)]
*  have been wondering how to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. Of course, it was a historic deal [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=223.22s)]
*  that the Obama administration brokered years ago, the JCPOA it was known as. But as soon [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=231.29999999999998s)]
*  as President Trump came into office, he pulled out of that deal because he said it was not [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=237.57999999999998s)]
*  a good one. And so it depends on the lawmakers, but they have been very vocal, some of them, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=243.78s)]
*  about the need to do something just like this. On the other hand, there are plenty of voices [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=252.45999999999998s)]
*  who were warning the president not to become directly involved because of the potential [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=258.02000000000004s)]
*  implications, not only for a wider conflict in the region, but what this could mean for [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=263.62s)]
*  US troops in the region and on the ground. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=269.26s)]
*  Some have said in the past that no one wanted to see another US led war in the Middle East [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=273.94s)]
*  after the history that the US has had with war in that region over the past several decades. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=279.34000000000003s)]
*  Would it be fair to say that? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=285.18s)]
*  The president himself said that many times on the campaign trail, many times as president, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=287.82s)]
*  that he did not want the US to be entangled in any foreign conflicts, which is exactly [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=293.41999999999996s)]
*  why there is a significant section of his MAGA base that is not on board with this plan, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=299.17999999999995s)]
*  that we're urging him not to become involved, because this was a campaign promise to end [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=309.34s)]
*  all wars and certainly not to involve the US in any other wars. The White House press [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=314.9s)]
*  secretary, Caroline Levitt, was asked about this directly during her last press briefing [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=320.62s)]
*  on Thursday, and her message to those skeptics about the possibility of a strike was to trust [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=325.42s)]
*  President Trump, was to trust any decision that he would make because it would be for [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=332.78000000000003s)]
*  the best for national security. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=338.18s)]
*  At this point, what do we expect the president to tell the nation at 10 p.m.? I mean, there's [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=342.41999999999996s)]
*  so many questions right now. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=348.78s)]
*  I think he will share a lot of details about the actual success of the strike, which he [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=352.58s)]
*  has already declared in one of his posts, so we anticipate hearing more details about [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=358.02s)]
*  what he means when he says they were successful. There was reporting from other outlets, the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  Guardian exclusively actually, in an article that said one reason why he hadn't given the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=371.42s)]
*  green light yet was because he did have some doubts about whether the operation would be [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=379.02000000000004s)]
*  fully successful. And our CBS News reporting was that he was briefed on all the pros and [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=384.22s)]
*  the cons about launching an attack on the Fordow nuclear site, but his mindset, his [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=390.74s)]
*  thinking was that he had to do it because he believed that was the only real way to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=397.66s)]
*  ensure that Iran would not move even closer to having a nuclear weapon. And I just asked [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=403.98s)]
*  about this the other day for clarification on what he meant when he said they were just [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=411.14000000000004s)]
*  a few weeks away from having a nuclear weapon. And the press secretary told me that it wasn't [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=416.90000000000003s)]
*  about having enough enriched uranium, which is the main component required to build one [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=422.86s)]
*  of these nuclear bombs, but she said that all it would take was the Supreme Leader making [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=429.22s)]
*  a decision to move forward and they could have one within two weeks. And that is a very [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=434.26000000000005s)]
*  specific timeline. It doesn't exactly align with what the IAEA, which is the agency that [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=440.78000000000003s)]
*  monitors nuclear sites around the world, assessed. They said that Iran was not actively [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=448.3s)]
*  making a nuclear bomb, but they certainly had an unprecedented amount of that enriched [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=455.02000000000004s)]
*  uranium. The U.S. intelligence, the latest assessment that has been made public, also [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=459.74s)]
*  mirrored that. And so we will be listening to see if the president has more information [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=467.18s)]
*  about exactly what led to this big decision. But, you know, I imagine he will also talk [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=473.98s)]
*  about what the plan is for next steps, because even though he wrote that now is the time [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=480.66s)]
*  for peace, the reality is that now is the time for many different stakeholders in this [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=486.70000000000005s)]
*  conflict to try to determine what the next steps are, because there's so much at stake [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=493.58000000000004s)]
*  here. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=498.98s)]
*  What do we know about the national security meeting that took place today? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=500.18s)]
*  Come back here around 6 p.m., which he did, and meet with his national security team, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=514.82s)]
*  which is not out of the ordinary given the tight deadline that he had set for determining [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=521.94s)]
*  he was going to do this or not. He had been having frequent national security team meetings [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=528.42s)]
*  since he rushed back from the G7 summit earlier in the week because he said he wanted to monitor [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=534.7399999999999s)]
*  the situation in Iran. And so we are trying to learn more about all the timing. We need [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=539.78s)]
*  a timeline, a tick-tock for exactly when this happened and, you know, where the president [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=546.6999999999999s)]
*  was, you know, how did he monitor these attacks? How did he receive information in real time [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=553.34s)]
*  as these teams were carrying them out? And again, what the plan is moving forward. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=560.98s)]
*  Do we know what Iranian state media is saying about all of this at this point, or have they [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=567.26s)]
*  say anything at all? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=571.34s)]
*  We are still, you know, this is obviously breaking news right now, so we are trying [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=575.7s)]
*  to get information from all of our teams in the region, from London, from Iran. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=581.1800000000001s)]
*  And so far, as far as just a few minutes ago, about 10 minutes ago, we have been monitoring [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=588.1800000000001s)]
*  Iranian press and there has not been a formal response yet. So nothing out of Iran at this [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=596.0600000000001s)]
*  hour, but that is a critical question as, you know, we wait to see what the response [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=602.02s)]
*  is going to be. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=608.1s)]
*  And also response from the rest of the world, Europe, for example. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=609.38s)]
*  Well, Europe just had meetings to try to have a diplomatic end to all of this. And the thing [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=613.38s)]
*  is that the U.S. was not directly involved with those. And so the Europeans really were [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=623.5400000000001s)]
*  trying to, you know, insert some kind of diplomacy and try to convince the Iranians to really [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=629.3000000000001s)]
*  come to the table with President Trump in the U.S. to discuss getting out of the conflict. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=637.3s)]
*  But the Iranians made very clear that they would not engage in direct talks with the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=643.3s)]
*  U.S. unless there was a ceasefire, unless Israel stopped bombing, stopped the attacks, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=649.3s)]
*  and vice versa, obviously, because they said they wouldn't negotiate during an active war. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=656.3s)]
*  But when I asked the White House about that, they dodged the question. They didn't say [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=663.3s)]
*  that that is something that the president was calling for. And in fact, he himself said [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=668.3s)]
*  that it's not something that he wanted because he thought the situation had already moved [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=673.3s)]
*  beyond that, that he wanted something bigger than a ceasefire, that he really, really guaranteed [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=679.3s)]
*  to an end of Iran's ambitions to develop a nuclear weapon. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=686.3s)]
*  So many questions that need to be answered tonight. In less than an hour, the president [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=692.3s)]
*  will be speaking at 10 p.m., as you mentioned. And we are awaiting what the president will [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=698.3s)]
*  say. But in the meantime, how do you think Democratic lawmakers are going to react to this news? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=703.3s)]
*  So we are gathering all of the reaction from these lawmakers on both sides, because this [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=711.3s)]
*  is obviously critical. But I imagine that many of those voices will be saying they warned [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=720.3s)]
*  that something like this could happen, that there could be an escalation in the region. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=727.3s)]
*  And so, again, we are just waiting to hear from more voices. And because this is just [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=733.3s)]
*  breaking and developing, some lawmakers might have are still getting read in on this, are [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=738.3s)]
*  still trying to get the latest intelligence on this. Of course, there were briefings [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=745.3s)]
*  on the Hill ahead of this. We know that the House speaker was briefed ahead of the U.S. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=750.3s)]
*  strike, and don't know whether he relayed that information. But this is a very ongoing [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=755.3s)]
*  situation. So we are just waiting to compile all of that reaction for you. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=762.3s)]
*  You've been following the White House for quite some time. What do you take of all of [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=768.3s)]
*  this that's happened, this unexpected bombing of Iran at this point, with no warning [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=773.3s)]
*  whatsoever, especially given the fact that the president had said he was going to be [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=779.3s)]
*  giving Iran two weeks. So this comes as a complete surprise. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=783.3s)]
*  Well, it does and it doesn't, because there was always some concern that even the [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=789.3s)]
*  announcement of that two-week window to try to reach a deal was just a head fake to clear [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=796.3s)]
*  the path, essentially, for this to happen, because you can't just do this overnight. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=802.3s)]
*  It takes time. It takes calculation. It takes the Pentagon and all of the teams that carry [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=807.3s)]
*  this out having the space to be able to do that. And so there was always one school of [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=815.3s)]
*  thinking that perhaps this was just an arbitrary deadline. But on the other hand, we had extensive [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=820.3s)]
*  reporting that there were loud voices and advisors surrounding the president who were [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=827.3s)]
*  having him really think through whether this was the right move because of the potential [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=833.3s)]
*  implications and all the unknowns involved with this. And so with this particular president, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=840.3s)]
*  it's not necessarily ever a surprise, even though it might be shocking because it is [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=846.3s)]
*  unprecedented. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=851.3s)]
*  Unprecedented and quite the gamble as well. Let's talk about the sites that were hit. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=854.3s)]
*  What do you know about this from covering the White House and these particular sites that were [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=860.3s)]
*  targeted? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=865.3s)]
*  These are Iran's nuclear sites, and so obviously these are where they are developing their [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=866.3s)]
*  potential components for the weapons. And for Dow is extremely tricky because it is built into [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=874.3s)]
*  the side of a mountain, and it is very difficult to get to, which is why the U.S. bunker buster [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=883.3s)]
*  bomb that was used, this particular kind of bomb, is really the only option to completely [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=891.3s)]
*  destroy for Dow. And we don't even know if that was the case, whether it completely took it out or [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=898.3s)]
*  just partially. But the 30-pound bomb had to also be transported by U.S. B-2s to drop it down [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=905.3s)]
*  because you're talking about such massive weaponry here. And so the hope, and President Trump [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=915.3s)]
*  said as much in his post, is that it was able to disable and decapitate really these sites that are so [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=924.3s)]
*  critical to Iran's nuclear program. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktIexCa7Wu0&t=933.3s)]
