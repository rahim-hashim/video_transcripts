# Kaine says Congress wasn't consulted about U.S. strike on Iran
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg)
*  We go now to the Democratic Senator, Tim Kaine, who joins us from Richmond, Virginia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning to you, Senator. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=5.36s)]
*  Good morning, Margaret. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=7.36s)]
*  I know you sit on the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, but what [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=8.36s)]
*  we just heard from the Pentagon was that Congress was notified after the strike on Iran was [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=13.3s)]
*  concluded after the U.S. jets are back in safety. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=20.44s)]
*  Is this sufficient? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=25.84s)]
*  Margaret, no. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=27.64s)]
*  Congress needs to authorize a war against Iran, this Trump war against Iran. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=29.6s)]
*  We have not. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=34.88s)]
*  Congress should be consulted with it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=36.28s)]
*  We were not. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  And Congress needs to be notified not after the fact, but in advance. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=39.08s)]
*  We were not. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=42.52s)]
*  That's why I filed a war powers resolution that will ripen and be brought to a vote on [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=43.94s)]
*  the floor of the Senate this week. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=49.8s)]
*  Senator Schumer is working with Leader Thune to make that happen. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=51.36s)]
*  The United States should not be in an offensive war against Iran without a vote of Congress. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=54.76s)]
*  The Constitution is completely clear on it, and I am so disappointed that the president [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=59.64s)]
*  has acted so prematurely. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  The Foreign Minister of Israel said Friday night that its own bombing campaign had set [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=68.44s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear program back, quote, at least two or three years, close quote. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=72.92s)]
*  There was no urgency that suggested, while diplomatic talks were underway, that the U.S. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=79.24s)]
*  should take this unilateral action by President Trump's orders yesterday. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=84.16s)]
*  Well, the vice president was on another network earlier this morning and said, we are not [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=88.44s)]
*  at war with Iran. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  We are at war with Iran's nuclear program. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  There seems to be a lot of legal parsing on the definition of the word war here. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  What do you make of that description? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=103.72s)]
*  I think it's BS, and I think anybody hearing it would conclude the same thing. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=105.06s)]
*  When you're bombing another nation, ask them if they think it's war. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=111.38s)]
*  They do. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=115.25999999999999s)]
*  Would we think it was war if Iran bombed a U.S. nuclear facility? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=116.25999999999999s)]
*  Of course we would. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  And the U.S., you know, we've invaded two neighbors of Iran, Afghanistan and Iraq, to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=122.44s)]
*  topple their regimes since 2000. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=128.5s)]
*  Those were wars. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=132.56s)]
*  This is the U.S. jumping into a war of choice at Donald Trump's urging without any compelling [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=134.18s)]
*  national security interests for the United States to act in this way, particularly without [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=140.62s)]
*  a debate and vote in Congress. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=145.34s)]
*  We should not be sending troops and risking troops' lives in an offensive war without [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=147.06s)]
*  a debate in Congress. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=152.26s)]
*  Well, just on the facts, though, the president has not authorized ground forces. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=153.66s)]
*  In fact, he said he really doesn't want to send in ground forces. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=158.82s)]
*  When it came to what was just described to the public by the Pentagon, it was really [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=162.86s)]
*  characterized as limited in scope. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=168.54s)]
*  It sounds like you believe those early hour descriptions are going to turn out to be false. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=170.92s)]
*  I do. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=176.76s)]
*  The War Powers Resolution says that a member of Congress can challenge the president if [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=177.84s)]
*  the president initiates hostilities against a foreign nation. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=182.84s)]
*  Doesn't use the, even though the title is War Powers Resolution, the statute says if [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=187.0s)]
*  you initiate hostilities without congressional authorization, even a single member of the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=192.04s)]
*  House or Senate can force a vote on the Senate floor. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=197.4s)]
*  There is no doubt that the U.S. sending this massive set of Tomahawk missiles and B-2 bombers [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=200.36s)]
*  and bunker busters on three Iranian nuclear sites is hostilities. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=206.8s)]
*  Now again, some in the Senate may say this is great and we want to vote for it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  I happen to think that getting into a third offensive war in the Middle East in the last [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=215.72s)]
*  25 years is absolutely reckless and foolish. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to be doing everything I can to convince my colleagues of that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=224.4s)]
*  I may or may not succeed, but Congress should have the debate and vote on this before we [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=228.04s)]
*  escalate the risk to American troops, which this action has done. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  We know that prior to this action, Northern Command had already directed additional security [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=237.32s)]
*  measures on all U.S. military installations. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=243.64s)]
*  You've got a lot of military installations in Virginia. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=245.92s)]
*  What do you know about the threat to the homeland at this point? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=249.16s)]
*  We're going to have a briefing Tuesday, Margaret, and I'll learn more then. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=253.44s)]
*  But what I do know, I also have a lot of Virginians deployed in the Middle East. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=256.52s)]
*  There are about 40,000 U.S. troops deployed all over the Middle East, sailors on Navy [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=260.08s)]
*  ships in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, folks in land bases in Syria and Iraq. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=264.8s)]
*  And yes, this action dramatically raises the risk to them. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=270.88s)]
*  And the question is for what? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=276.0s)]
*  If the Iranian nuclear program, Vice President Vance says it's a war against their nuclear [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=277.92s)]
*  program. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  Of course, we had curtailed that diplomatically a few years ago until Donald Trump tore up [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  the diplomatic deal. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=288.88s)]
*  But even if you needed to wage war, when the Israeli foreign minister is saying we've set [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=290.12s)]
*  the nuclear program back at least two or three years, why launch this strike escalating risk [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=295.16s)]
*  to Americans and American troops over the weekend with no real discussion with Congress, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=301.6s)]
*  no real debate before the American public? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=307.32s)]
*  I don't want to be lied into another war in the way we were with Iraq in 2002. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=309.32s)]
*  Thank you, Senator. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooik5l0aTGg&t=315.0s)]
