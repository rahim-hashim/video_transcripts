# Trump, Hegseth respond to early Iran damage assessment of U.S. strikes
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4)
*  As you know, last weekend, the United States successfully carried out a massive precision [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=0.0s)]
*  strike on Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=6.38s)]
*  And it was very, very successful. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  It was called obliteration. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=14.26s)]
*  No other military on Earth could have done it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=17.04s)]
*  And now this incredible exercise of American strength has paved the way for peace with [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=19.18s)]
*  the historic ceasefire agreement. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=25.54s)]
*  It was a great Monday, and we call it the 12-day war. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=28.16s)]
*  Spoke to a few people. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  I guess that just sounded like the right name. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=32.72s)]
*  It was a 12-day war. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=35.72s)]
*  And we think it's over. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=38.900000000000006s)]
*  I don't think they're going to be going back at each other. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=39.980000000000004s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=42.1s)]
*  Not only have we dealt decisively with the critical threat of Iran's nuclear program, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=44.16s)]
*  which was what I wanted. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=48.36s)]
*  I said Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=49.36s)]
*  I've said that for 15 years, long before I decided to do the political thing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=52.22s)]
*  But we've also reasserted the credibility of American deterrence, which is like no other. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=59.459999999999994s)]
*  The people at NATO said there's never been anything. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=65.7s)]
*  You know, I rebuilt the entire military during my first term. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=68.82s)]
*  And we have a great military. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=73.17999999999999s)]
*  We have great generals. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=75.5s)]
*  We got to know the good ones and the bad ones. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=76.5s)]
*  We kept the good ones. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=79.46s)]
*  Over the past two days, I was honored to participate in the NATO Leaders' Meeting and also had [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  extremely good individual discussions with the King and the Queen, Secretary General [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=87.02000000000001s)]
*  Rutte, and the Prime Minister. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=91.66s)]
*  Great discussions. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=94.18s)]
*  Very knowledgeable people. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=96.18s)]
*  Major focus of our conversations at the summit was the need for other NATO members to take [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=97.78s)]
*  up the burden of the defense of Europe. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=103.94s)]
*  And that included the financial burden. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  As you know, it was 2 percent and we got it up to 5 percent. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=109.8s)]
*  And they said, a couple of them came up to me, one in particular said, sir, we've been [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=114.8s)]
*  trying to get it up to 3 percent for 20 years and we haven't been able and you got it up [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=118.42s)]
*  to 5 percent. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=123.12s)]
*  So they're going to be most of them, I guess almost all of them are going to be contributing [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=124.8s)]
*  now 5 percent, a number that people are surprised at, but you need it today. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=128.24s)]
*  The United States accounts for two-thirds of all NATO defense spending. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=135.24s)]
*  Since I began pushing for additional commitments in 2017, believe it or not, our allies have [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=139.22s)]
*  increased spending by $700 billion. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=145.18s)]
*  I said to people, you don't have any money. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=149.02s)]
*  And a lot of them weren't paying. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=151.14000000000001s)]
*  And so I started the process and I picked it up as soon as I got back, which is six [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=153.54000000000002s)]
*  months ago. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=157.18s)]
*  And following my election last November, almost all have accelerated plans to reach the 2 [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=159.06s)]
*  percent, 3 percent, 4 percent, and then ultimately very quickly 5 percent. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=166.72s)]
*  And all of this is going to be done very quickly, almost immediately. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  You probably know this as well as I do. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=175.98s)]
*  I'm sure they've been talking about it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  It's really been a big focus. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=179.76s)]
*  In a very historic milestone this week, the NATO allies committed to dramatically increase [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  their defense spending to that 5 percent of GDP, something that no one really thought [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  possible. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  And they said, you did it, sir, you did it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=194.9s)]
*  Well, I don't know if I did it, but I think I did. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=196.62s)]
*  This will be known as the Hague Defense Commitment, which is pretty good, pretty appropriate. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=200.1s)]
*  When the allies reach this number, it will add more than $1 trillion a year. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=207.22s)]
*  Think of that $1 trillion per year to our common defense. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=212.82s)]
*  And this is a monument really to victory, but it's a monumental win for the United States [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=216.7s)]
*  because we were carrying much more than our fair share. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=224.58s)]
*  It was quite unfair, actually. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=227.38000000000002s)]
*  But this is a big win for Europe and for actually Western civilization. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=230.18s)]
*  For years past, administrations failed to get most allies to contribute even the 2 percent. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=234.34s)]
*  I remember when I came here, we had four countries that were up to 2 percent. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=241.10000000000002s)]
*  And I remember Poland was there. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  A couple of them were there. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=247.18s)]
*  But most of them were. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=250.08s)]
*  We were 28 at the time, as you know, it's increased a little bit. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=251.14000000000001s)]
*  And they've agreed now to more than double their budgets in all cases. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  And Europe stepping up to take more responsibility for its security will help prevent future [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=260.38s)]
*  disasters like the horrible situation with Russia and Ukraine. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=265.42s)]
*  And hopefully we're going to get that solved. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=270.04s)]
*  Last week, they lost 7,000 soldiers, mostly soldiers, but they're also getting hit in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=272.54s)]
*  Kiev. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=277.58000000000004s)]
*  They're getting hit in some of the towns also. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=279.08s)]
*  And that means life. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  Life is disappearing also in the cities and towns should have never happened, would have [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  never happened if I was president. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=289.76s)]
*  Said it a thousand times. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=291.76s)]
*  And it never did happen. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=294.08s)]
*  It's never even thought about. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=295.08s)]
*  But it's vital that this additional money be spent on very serious military hardware, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  not bureaucracy. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=303.56s)]
*  And hopefully that hardware is going to be made in America because we have the best hardware [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=305.34s)]
*  in the world. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=310.09999999999997s)]
*  You saw that where 14 missiles were shot at us the other day. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=311.09999999999997s)]
*  And they were very nice. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=315.09999999999997s)]
*  They gave us warning. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=317.58s)]
*  They said we're going to shoot them. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=318.58s)]
*  Is one o'clock okay? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=320.06s)]
*  They said it's fine. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=321.38s)]
*  And everybody was emptied off the base so they couldn't get hurt except for the gunners. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=324.26s)]
*  They call them the gunners. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=329.58s)]
*  And out of 14 high-end missiles that were shot at the base in Qatar, all 14, as you [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=331.96s)]
*  know, were shot down by our equipment. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=338.79999999999995s)]
*  Amazing stuff. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=341.64s)]
*  Amazing that they can do. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=342.64s)]
*  It's like shooting a bullet with a bullet. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=343.84s)]
*  It's the same thing if you think about it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=346.68s)]
*  14 out of 14 and they were they weren't even that surprised. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=348.96s)]
*  I said, do you do that well often? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  They say we pretty much do, sir. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=355.67999999999995s)]
*  The Ukraine crisis has also highlighted the urgency of rebuilding our defense industrial [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=359.21999999999997s)]
*  base both in the United States and among the allied nations. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=363.97999999999996s)]
*  We cannot afford to be dependent on foreign adversaries for critical minerals. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=368.02s)]
*  And as you know, we made a deal with Ukraine to take a vast amount of the land they have [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=373.82s)]
*  for minerals we needed. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=378.97999999999996s)]
*  And once again, I want to thank all of the people in the Netherlands. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=381.65999999999997s)]
*  Incredible people. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=384.97999999999996s)]
*  It's a great place. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=385.97999999999996s)]
*  To all of the NATO allies for the tremendous summit that we just had, a letter just came [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=387.58s)]
*  in and a statement came in from the Atomic Energy Commission of Israel. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=393.88s)]
*  And I just wondered, this is an official letter and they're very serious people, as you know. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=402.2s)]
*  The devastating U.S. strike on Fordow destroyed the site's critical infrastructure and rendered [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=407.79999999999995s)]
*  the enrichment facility totally inoperable. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=413.88s)]
*  It was devastated. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=417.2s)]
*  We assess that the American strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities has set back Iran's ability [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=419.32s)]
*  to develop nuclear weapons for many years to come. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=425.12s)]
*  This achievement can continue indefinitely if Iran does not get access to nuclear material, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=429.5s)]
*  which it won't. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=435.98s)]
*  It's so sad that that whole thing had to go. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=438.34s)]
*  But I just want to thank our pilots. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=441.62s)]
*  They were maligned and treated very bad, demeaned by fake new CNN, which is back there, believe [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=443.98s)]
*  it or not, wasting time, wasting it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=449.96000000000004s)]
*  Nobody's watching them. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=452.44s)]
*  So they're just wasting a lot of time, wasting my time. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=453.44s)]
*  And the New York Times, they put out a story that, well, maybe they were hit, but it wasn't [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=456.94s)]
*  bad. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=461.72s)]
*  Well, it was so bad that they ended the war. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=462.72s)]
*  It ended the war. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=465.20000000000005s)]
*  Somebody said in a certain way that it was so devastating, actually. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=467.62s)]
*  If you look at Hiroshima, if you look at Nagasaki, you know, that ended a war, too. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=472.18s)]
*  This ended a war in a different way. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=477.26s)]
*  But it was so devastating. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=478.90000000000003s)]
*  Also they have, out of Dubai, just came that Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, this is [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=481.62s)]
*  Iran's Foreign Ministry, says it's near its nuclear installations were very badly damaged [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=488.66s)]
*  by the American strike. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=496.16s)]
*  So what bothered me about these reports, with fake reports put out by the New York Times, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=499.3s)]
*  failing, I call it the failing New York Times because it's doing terribly. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=504.42s)]
*  Without me, it would be doing no business at all. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=508.42s)]
*  And by fake news, CNN and MSDNC, all of these terrible people, you know, they have no credibility. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=511.98s)]
*  You know, when I started, they were at 94 percent credibility. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=521.06s)]
*  The media now it's at 16 percent. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=523.86s)]
*  And I'm very proud of it because I've exposed it for what it is. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=526.38s)]
*  But when I saw them starting to question the caliber of the attack, was it bad? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=529.22s)]
*  It was really bad. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=539.22s)]
*  It was devastating. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=540.22s)]
*  They obliterated. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=541.22s)]
*  Like you can't get into the tunnels. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=542.22s)]
*  They just put that over. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=543.7800000000001s)]
*  That just came out. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=545.26s)]
*  They can't, there's nothing, there's no way you can even get down. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=546.26s)]
*  The whole thing is collapsed in a disaster. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=548.46s)]
*  And I think all of the nuclear stuff is down there because it's very hard to remove. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=551.38s)]
*  We did it very quickly when they heard we were coming. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=556.4599999999999s)]
*  It was, you know, you can't move it. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=559.3s)]
*  Very hard, very dangerous actually to move to. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=560.86s)]
*  And they also knew we were coming. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=564.02s)]
*  So I don't think too many people want to be down there knowing we're coming with the bunker [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=565.4599999999999s)]
*  busters as we call them. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=569.54s)]
*  We're the only ones that have them. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=570.9399999999999s)]
*  We have the best equipment, best nuclear equipment, and we have the best equipment in the world. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=571.9399999999999s)]
*  And by the way, we can't forget our submarine, which was out there, submarines actually, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=576.62s)]
*  but submarine was out there. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=582.3s)]
*  We shot 30 rockets into an area, every single one of them. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=583.58s)]
*  I think it was almost 400 miles away, I think, Pete, right? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=591.1800000000001s)]
*  400 and long. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=595.7s)]
*  It was in the ocean, long ways away. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=597.82s)]
*  And we shot, we shot a total of 30. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=601.86s)]
*  Every single one of them hit within nine inches from where it was supposed to be. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=606.86s)]
*  It took it a lot because we didn't do just four though. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=610.4200000000001s)]
*  We did two others in addition, which hadn't been completely destroyed. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=613.26s)]
*  So we hit them with a submarine from hundreds of miles away. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=620.58s)]
*  Amazing, just amazing equipment. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=624.9399999999999s)]
*  Greatest submarines in the world. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=627.74s)]
*  Nobody's even close. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=629.14s)]
*  They're 20 years behind us when it comes to submarine technology. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=630.14s)]
*  So that's one. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=634.74s)]
*  And the other was from the Atomic Energy Commission. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=635.74s)]
*  They have about three or four of them now coming in from Atomic Energy Commissions from [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=642.02s)]
*  various places. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=645.7s)]
*  But the one that we have that just came out, we released it a little while ago, was from [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=646.84s)]
*  the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=653.34s)]
*  But numerous of them are getting to see the site. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=655.66s)]
*  And the site has been demolished. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=658.74s)]
*  And again, we had these brave patriots, these incredible flyers, these people that can fly [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=660.9s)]
*  a plane better than anybody can fly a plane, going into very hostile territory, flying [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=669.36s)]
*  into the territory that has got more missiles and things pointed at it. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=673.7600000000001s)]
*  But it was very stealth. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=680.7600000000001s)]
*  They didn't get to see it. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=681.7600000000001s)]
*  It was dark. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=682.96s)]
*  That's the amazing thing about the shots. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=683.96s)]
*  They hit the shots perfectly. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=685.96s)]
*  And yet it was dead dark. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=687.5200000000001s)]
*  There was no moon. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=688.84s)]
*  There was no light. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=689.84s)]
*  It was virtually moonless. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=690.84s)]
*  It was very dark. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=693.0400000000001s)]
*  And the shots were hit perfectly. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=695.1400000000001s)]
*  When they get demeaned, and they were very upset about it because they knew how strong [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=697.4s)]
*  it would be. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=701.24s)]
*  Back in Missouri, the pilots flew about 36 hours, two ways, far distance, and in those [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=702.24s)]
*  incredible B-2s. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=709.12s)]
*  And we then had the F-22s, and we had the F-35s, and we had other planes. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=710.6800000000001s)]
*  And we had, I think, a total of 52 tankers. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=714.84s)]
*  That means the big tankers, because the refueling was a lot for all of the different planes [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=717.8s)]
*  that we sent. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=723.12s)]
*  Incredible operation. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=724.72s)]
*  And I have to say, General Reisenknein was incredible. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=725.8000000000001s)]
*  That's why he beat ISIS. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=730.0s)]
*  We beat ISIS in a matter of weeks. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=731.52s)]
*  I was told it would take four to five years. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=733.8000000000001s)]
*  We did it in a few weeks. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=735.6s)]
*  And he was great. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=737.8000000000001s)]
*  That's why he's the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff right now, because I had a very good [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  experience with him. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=743.32s)]
*  He knocked out ISIS in a period of literally a few weeks. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=744.32s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=748.1600000000001s)]
*  And it was supposed to take a few years, five years to be exact. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=749.1600000000001s)]
*  So we had a great victory there, and we then came here, and I think we had a great victory [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=755.0799999999999s)]
*  here. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=760.84s)]
*  But this is an ongoing project. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=761.84s)]
*  This is the safety of Europe, the safety of the world. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=763.28s)]
*  And they've raised it from 2 percent to 5 percent, something which nobody – and you're [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=766.92s)]
*  talking about over a trillion dollars a year. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=770.6s)]
*  So we're talking about a lot of money from coming in from countries that were not paying [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=773.4399999999999s)]
*  nearly enough to be effective. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=778.0s)]
*  So I have, as you know, Marco Rubio with me and Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State and Secretary [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  of War. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=787.88s)]
*  Should we say Secretary – you know, it used to be called Secretary of War. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=788.88s)]
*  Maybe for a couple of weeks we'll call it that, because we feel like warriors. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=791.64s)]
*  It used to be called Secretary of War. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=795.16s)]
*  In fact, if you look at the old building next to the White House, you can see where it used [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=797.08s)]
*  to be Secretary of War. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=801.48s)]
*  Then we became politically correct, and they called it Secretary of Defense. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=802.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=806.6s)]
*  Maybe we'll have to start thinking about changing it. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=807.6s)]
*  You see, we're here this morning because in hunting for scandals all the time, in trying [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=810.84s)]
*  to find wedges and spin stories, this press corps and the press corps miss historic moments. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=816.72s)]
*  You miss historic moments like 5 percent at NATO, which when you hear – I was in the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=825.8000000000001s)]
*  closed-door briefing. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=830.32s)]
*  I wish there could have been cameras in there. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=831.32s)]
*  When you heard the prime ministers and presidents of other countries, to a man and to a woman, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=832.52s)]
*  looking at President Trump and saying, this never could have happened. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=837.04s)]
*  Never would have happened. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=839.94s)]
*  It seemed impossible five years ago, two years ago, eight years ago. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=840.94s)]
*  But here we are because of your leadership. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=845.3000000000001s)]
*  If you asked them the question, I bet they'd say the same thing. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=848.1800000000001s)]
*  But searching for scandals, you miss historic moments like recruiting at the Pentagon, historic [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=852.1s)]
*  levels in the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=857.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, maybe there'll be a little mention here or there. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=860.1800000000001s)]
*  But because it was under President Trump's leadership, because it was because Americans [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=862.4000000000001s)]
*  are responding to him as commander in chief, the press corps doesn't want to write about [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=867.78s)]
*  him. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=871.9399999999999s)]
*  Or bring us to the topic of the moment, the highly successful strikes in Iran. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=872.9399999999999s)]
*  Let me read the bottom line here. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=879.66s)]
*  President Trump directed the most complex and secretive military operation in history, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=882.86s)]
*  and it was a resounding success, resulting in a ceasefire agreement and the end of the [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=888.98s)]
*  12-day war. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=894.54s)]
*  There's been a lot of discussion about what happened and what didn't happen. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=897.18s)]
*  Step back for a second. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=899.58s)]
*  Because of decisive military action, President Trump created the conditions to end the war, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=901.3s)]
*  decimating, choose your word, obliterating, destroying Iran's nuclear capabilities. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=907.62s)]
*  I want to read some of the assessments that have been provided because whether it's fake [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=915.78s)]
*  news, CNN, MSNBC, or the New York Times, there's been fawning coverage of a preliminary assessment. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=920.8199999999999s)]
*  I've had a chance to read it. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=928.8199999999999s)]
*  Every outlet has breathlessly reported on a preliminary assessment from DIA. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=931.18s)]
*  I'm looking at it right now. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=936.78s)]
*  Again, it was preliminary, a day and a half after the actual strike. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=938.6999999999999s)]
*  When it admits itself in writing that it requires weeks to accumulate the necessary data to [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=943.62s)]
*  make such an assessment, it's preliminary. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=947.98s)]
*  It points out that it's not been coordinated with the intelligence community at all. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=950.22s)]
*  There's low confidence in this particular report. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=955.3800000000001s)]
*  It says in the report, there are gaps in the information. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=958.58s)]
*  It says in the report, multiple linchpin assumptions are what this assessment, a linchpin assumption. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=960.74s)]
*  You know what that is? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=967.4200000000001s)]
*  That means your entire premise is predicated on a linchpin. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=968.4200000000001s)]
*  If you're wrong, everything else is wrong. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=971.22s)]
*  And yet, still, this report acknowledges it's likely severe damage. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=973.58s)]
*  Again, this is preliminary. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=978.46s)]
*  Leaked because someone had an agenda to try to muddy the waters and make it look like [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=980.46s)]
*  this historic strike wasn't successful. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=984.0200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to get to the chairman in a moment because he's going to lay out the particulars [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=986.7s)]
*  for you based on his professional military experience. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=990.26s)]
*  But here's what other folks are saying. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=993.4200000000001s)]
*  The DIA that put that report out says that this is a preliminary, low confidence report [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=995.3000000000001s)]
*  and will continue to be refined as additional intelligence becomes available. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1000.66s)]
*  How about the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1006.94s)]
*  The devastating U.S. strikes on Fordow destroyed the site's critical infrastructure and rendered [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1009.5s)]
*  the enrichment facility inoperable. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1015.0s)]
*  Have any of these quotes made their way into the New York Times or the Washington Post? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1018.22s)]
*  MSNBC? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1021.54s)]
*  CNN? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1022.54s)]
*  Any of these quotes? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1023.54s)]
*  How about this one? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1025.58s)]
*  This is a new one. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1026.58s)]
*  From the UN, the United Nations. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1027.58s)]
*  No friend of the United States or certainly Israel often. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1029.36s)]
*  Here's the head of the UN Atomic Energy Agency this morning, Rafael Grossi. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1032.6s)]
*  U.S. and Israeli strikes caused enormous damage to Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1037.9199999999998s)]
*  Don't take my word for it. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1045.24s)]
*  How about the IDF's chief of staff? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1046.24s)]
*  I can say here that the assessment is that we significantly damaged the nuclear program, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1048.4399999999998s)]
*  setting it back by years. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1053.32s)]
*  I repeat, years. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1054.6799999999998s)]
*  The Iranian foreign minister, the spokesman, our nuclear installations have been badly [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1057.24s)]
*  damaged, that's for sure. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1061.76s)]
*  I'm sure that's an understatement. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1063.8s)]
*  John Radcliffe, the director of the CIA, putting out a statement just last night. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1066.2s)]
*  CIA can confirm that a body of credible intelligence indicates Iran's nuclear program has been [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1071.0s)]
*  severely damaged by recent targeted strikes. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1077.0s)]
*  This includes new intelligence from a historically reliable, very different than preliminary [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1080.52s)]
*  assessment with low confidence. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1085.64s)]
*  He's saying historically reliable and accurate source and method that several key Iranian [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1088.1200000000001s)]
*  nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1093.16s)]
*  CIA continues to collect additional reliably sourced information to keep appropriate decision [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1100.92s)]
*  makers fully informed. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1107.5s)]
*  How about DNI Talsey Gabbard yesterday? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1110.2800000000002s)]
*  And I quote, new intelligence confirms what POTUS has stated numerous times. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1114.44s)]
*  Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1118.88s)]
*  Institute for Science and International Security President David Albright, overall Israel and [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1124.8400000000001s)]
*  US attacks have effectively destroyed UN, Iran's centrifuge enrichment program. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1129.92s)]
*  Time and time again, I can go down the list. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1137.96s)]
*  Those that understand, those that see, those that do proper assessments recognize that [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1141.12s)]
*  what the United States military did was historic. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1147.44s)]
*  And again, before I pass it to the chairman, because you, and I mean specifically you, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1149.92s)]
*  the press, specifically you, the press corps, because you cheer against Trump so hard, it's [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1158.36s)]
*  in your DNA and in your blood to cheer against Trump, because you want him not to be successful [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1166.16s)]
*  so bad, you have to cheer against the efficacy of these strikes. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1171.4s)]
*  You have to hope maybe they weren't effective. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1176.72s)]
*  Maybe the way the Trump administration has represented him isn't true. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1179.68s)]
*  So let's take half truths, spun information, leaked information, and then spin it, spin [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1182.6200000000001s)]
*  in every way we can to try to cause doubt and manipulate the mind, the public mind over [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1191.0s)]
*  whether or not our brave pilots were successful. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1197.5800000000002s)]
*  How many stories have been written about how hard it is to, I don't know, fly a plane for [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1201.92s)]
*  36 hours? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1206.0800000000002s)]
*  Has MSNBC done that story? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1208.2800000000002s)]
*  Has Fox? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1210.46s)]
*  Have we done the story how hard that is? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1211.5600000000002s)]
*  Have we done it two or three times? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1213.5800000000002s)]
*  So that American people understand how about how difficult it is to shoot a drone from [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1215.2800000000002s)]
*  an F-15 or 16 or F-22 or F-35, or what it's like to man a Patriot battery, or how hard [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1218.0s)]
*  it is to refuel midair, giving the American people an understanding of how complex and [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1224.32s)]
*  sophisticated this mission really was. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1229.16s)]
*  There are so many aspects of what our brave men and women did that because of the hatred [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1232.06s)]
*  of this press corps are undermined because people are trying to leak and spin that it [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1237.16s)]
*  wasn't successful. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1244.16s)]
*  It's irresponsible. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1245.16s)]
*  Folks in this room are privy to that information because of the proximity here in the Pentagon. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1248.44s)]
*  It's an important responsibility. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1253.42s)]
*  And time and time again, classified information is leaked or peddled for political purposes [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1255.2s)]
*  to try to make the president look bad. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1260.68s)]
*  And what's really happening is you're undermining the success of incredible B-2 pilots and incredible [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1262.34s)]
*  F-35 pilots and incredible refuelers and incredible air defenders who accomplished their mission, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1267.44s)]
*  and who set back a nuclear program in ways that other presidents would have dreamed. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1274.2s)]
*  How about we celebrate that? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1278.48s)]
*  How about we talk about how special America is, that only we have these capabilities? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1280.82s)]
*  I think it's too much to ask, unfortunately, for the fake news, so we're used to that. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1286.16s)]
*  But we also have an opportunity to stand at the podium and read the truth of what's really [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1290.72s)]
*  happening. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1294.76s)]
*  And the reality is you want to call it destroyed, you want to call it defeated, you want to [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1295.76s)]
*  call it obliterated. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1299.2s)]
*  Choose your word. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1301.12s)]
*  This was an historically successful attack and we should celebrate it as Americans. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1303.24s)]
*  And it gives us a chance to have peace, a chance to have a deal, and an opportunity [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1307.1200000000001s)]
*  to prevent a nuclear Iran, which is something President Trump talked about for 20 years [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1311.6s)]
*  and no other presidents had the courage to actually do. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1316.04s)]
*  So with that, I want to hand it over to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1319.8s)]
*  They've done tactical analysis on this, not just on the strike, but also on our patriot [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1322.52s)]
*  defenders on Al Udeid. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1328.24s)]
*  And Mr. Chairman, I'll hand it over to you. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1329.24s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1331.24s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Secretary, and good morning, and all of you. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1332.24s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1335.28s)]
*  As a follow-up to my comments on Sunday's press conference, I wanted to give you a few [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1336.6s)]
*  updates this morning on something I'm honored to do as a chairman, and that's a chance to [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1340.8s)]
*  get to talk about some of our service members and the incredible things that they do on [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1346.08s)]
*  behalf of our nation. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1351.36s)]
*  And I apologize ahead of time for the length and the detail. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1352.64s)]
*  Today I'm going to brief you on a couple things. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1356.72s)]
*  First, I'm going to talk about our air defenders at Al Udeid in Qatar and their actions on [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1359.72s)]
*  Monday. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1363.36s)]
*  Then I'm going to walk you through a little bit about the academics that went into the [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1364.36s)]
*  attack against Fordow, the massive ordnance penetrator weapon, and we're going to show [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1367.56s)]
*  a video that highlights the effects that that weapon has. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1372.9199999999998s)]
*  Of course, nobody was down inside the target, so we don't have video from the target. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1377.96s)]
*  First on Monday, as the president has stated, on Monday morning we began to receive indications [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1383.48s)]
*  and warnings that Iran intended to attack U.S. bases in the region. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1388.72s)]
*  That morning, building on the work that CENTCOM commander Eric Carrillo had done, and on the [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1395.04s)]
*  orders of the president, at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and around the region, we assumed [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1400.84s)]
*  a minimum force posture. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1406.9s)]
*  Most folks had moved off the base to extend the security perimeter out away from what [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1409.3600000000001s)]
*  we assessed might be a target zone, except for a very few army soldiers at Al Udeid. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1414.98s)]
*  At that point, only two Patriot batteries remained on base, roughly 44 American soldiers [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1423.9s)]
*  responsible for defending the entire base, to include CENTCOM's forward headquarters [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1431.54s)]
*  in the Middle East, an entire air base, and all the U.S. forces there. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1437.9s)]
*  The oldest soldier was a 28-year-old captain. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1443.06s)]
*  The youngest was a 21-year-old private who'd been in the military for less than two years. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1447.54s)]
*  So let's put ourselves out there for a second. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1454.68s)]
*  Imagine you're that young First Lieutenant, you're 25 or 26 years old, and you've been [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1457.48s)]
*  assigned as the tactical director inside the command and control element. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1463.54s)]
*  You at that age are the sole person responsible to defend this base. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1469.42s)]
*  Listening next to you is your early warning operator whose job is to notify you of imminent [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1476.42s)]
*  attack. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1482.0600000000002s)]
*  There's five people inside a vehicle and five people outside of a vehicle around these, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1483.0600000000002s)]
*  a total of, as I said, 44. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1488.3000000000002s)]
*  By the way, you've sat in the Middle East for years, deployed over and over again, extended [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1491.18s)]
*  multiple times, always being prepared but unsure of when that particular day will come [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1498.66s)]
*  that you must execute your mission and not fail at doing it. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1505.8200000000002s)]
*  In this case, these Patriot crews were deployed from Korea and Japan as part of our U.S. forces [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1510.6200000000001s)]
*  there to ensure that we had the most capable missiles in the CENTCOM area of responsibility. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1516.5s)]
*  As the day continues, you start to hear more and more chatter in the information space [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1524.3s)]
*  about an impending attack. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1529.36s)]
*  And as the sun starts to set in the west, you get orders from your higher headquarters [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1531.94s)]
*  to make sure that your missile batteries are pointed to the north. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1538.04s)]
*  There are just a few other teammates. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1542.74s)]
*  It's hot, you're getting nervous, and you expect an attack. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1544.78s)]
*  Inside of those Patriot vehicles, your hot crew, which is one NCO and four additional [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1549.9s)]
*  soldiers, turns the key and relinquishes control of those missiles to that young lieutenant [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1555.38s)]
*  inside the vehicle, and you wait. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1561.6200000000001s)]
*  You know that you're going to have approximately two minutes, 120 seconds to either succeed [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1565.3000000000002s)]
*  or fail. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1572.42s)]
*  And then at approximately 1230 p.m. on Monday, that's 730 p.m. in Qatar, as the sun sets [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1574.14s)]
*  in the west, Iran attacks. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1582.1000000000001s)]
*  As the targets were detected, round after round of Patriot missiles are ejected from [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1586.0800000000002s)]
*  their canisters by an initial launch charge. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1592.38s)]
*  Then the main solid rocket motor ignites. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1595.88s)]
*  You can feel this in your body if you've ever been around a Patriot taking a shot. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1598.6200000000001s)]
*  And round after round goes out and guides against those missiles coming inbound. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1603.56s)]
*  We believe that this is the largest single Patriot engagement in U.S. military history, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1608.72s)]
*  and we were joined in this engagement by the Qatari Patriot crews. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1615.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you how many rounds were shot, but it was a bunch because of classified [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1622.08s)]
*  purposes. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1627.0s)]
*  And we're aware that there's reports of something getting through. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1628.1799999999998s)]
*  What we do know is there was a lot of metal flying around between attacking missiles being [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1631.72s)]
*  hit by Patriots, boosters from attacking missiles being hit by Patriots, the Patriots themselves [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1637.72s)]
*  flying around, and the debris from those Patriots hitting the ground. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1644.5s)]
*  There was a lot of metal flying around. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1648.6200000000001s)]
*  And yet our U.S. air defenders had only seconds to make complex decisions with strategic impact. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1651.0s)]
*  These awesome humans, along with their Qatari brothers and sisters in arms, stood between [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1658.4s)]
*  a salvo of Iranian missiles and the safety of Al Udeid. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1663.94s)]
*  They are the unsung heroes of the 21st century United States Army. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1668.76s)]
*  And I know a lot of you have seen the videos online and the excitement as those Patriots [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1673.92s)]
*  departed their launchers and went up and guided. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1678.88s)]
*  This really demonstrates the combat capability and capacity of our Army air defenders. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1683.0s)]
*  Simply stated, they absolutely crushed it. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1690.16s)]
*  If you'd flip this over, thanks. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1694.76s)]
*  Let me next move to a walkthrough of the GBU-57 massive ordnance penetrator weapon and share [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1696.48s)]
*  a little bit about the planners who did this and their work on the weapon. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1706.84s)]
*  First, let me set the stage for you. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1711.72s)]
*  There's an organization in the U.S. called the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DITRA. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1715.92s)]
*  DITRA does a lot of things for our nation, but DITRA is the world's leading expert on [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1722.28s)]
*  deeply buried underground targets. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1728.8s)]
*  In 2009, a Defense Threat Reduction Agency officer was brought into a vault at an undisclosed [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1732.08s)]
*  location and briefed on something going on in Iran. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1739.6399999999999s)]
*  For security purposes, I'm not going to share his name. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1743.8s)]
*  He was shown some photos and some highly classified intelligence of what looked like a major construction [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1747.1599999999999s)]
*  project in the mountains of Iran. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1752.76s)]
*  He was tasked to study this facility, work with the intelligence community to understand [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1755.48s)]
*  it, and he was soon joined by an additional teammate. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1760.6s)]
*  For more than 15 years, this officer and his teammate lived and breathed this single target, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1764.4s)]
*  Fordow, a critical element of Iran's covert nuclear weapons program. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1771.4s)]
*  He studied the geology. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1777.44s)]
*  He watched the Iranians dig it out. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1778.92s)]
*  He watched the construction, the weather, the discard material, the geology, the construction [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1781.0800000000002s)]
*  materials, where the materials came from. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1786.3200000000002s)]
*  He looked at the vent shaft, the exhaust shaft, the electrical systems, the environmental [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1789.0400000000002s)]
*  control systems, every nook, every crater, every piece of equipment going in and every [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1793.8s)]
*  piece of equipment going out. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1799.28s)]
*  They literally dreamed about this target at night when they slept. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1801.28s)]
*  They thought about it driving back and forth to work, and they knew from the very first [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1806.6000000000001s)]
*  days what this was for. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1811.96s)]
*  You do not build a multi-layered underground bunker complex with centrifuges and other [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1814.34s)]
*  equipment in a mountain for any peaceful purpose. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1820.92s)]
*  They were not able to discuss this with their family, their wives, their kids, their friends, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1824.92s)]
*  but they just kept grinding it out. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1830.16s)]
*  Along the way, they realized we did not have a weapon that could adequately strike and [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1832.64s)]
*  kill this target. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1838.1200000000001s)]
*  They began a journey to work with industry and other tacticians to develop the GBU-57. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1839.8400000000001s)]
*  They tested it over and over again, tried different options, tried more after that. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1846.56s)]
*  They accomplished hundreds of test shots and dropped many full-scale weapons against extremely [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1852.6s)]
*  realistic targets for a single purpose. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1859.76s)]
*  Kill this target at the time and place of our nation's choosing. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1863.8s)]
*  And then, on a day in June of 2025, more than 15 years after they started their life's work, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1869.96s)]
*  the phone rang and the President of the United States ordered the B-2 force that you've supported [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1876.56s)]
*  to go strike and kill this target. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1882.2s)]
*  Yesterday, I had the incredible honor and privilege of spending time with these two [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1884.44s)]
*  Defense Threat Reduction Agency officers who've given so much. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1888.52s)]
*  One of them said, quote, I can't even get my head around this. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1893.96s)]
*  My heart is so filled with the pride of being a part of this team. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1897.72s)]
*  I am so honored to be a part of this. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1902.8799999999999s)]
*  To you both, thank you and thank you to your families. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1905.52s)]
*  Operation Midnight Hammer was the culmination of those 15 years of incredible work. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1910.8799999999999s)]
*  The air crews, the tanker crews, the weapons crews that built the weapons, the load crews [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1914.76s)]
*  that loaded it. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1919.52s)]
*  Before I run through this video today, I want to talk a little bit about weaponeering and [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1921.2s)]
*  what goes into an attack. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1925.6s)]
*  Weaponeering is the science of evaluating a target. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1929.44s)]
*  I mentioned all of those factors before that these two DITRA officers had thought about. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1931.76s)]
*  Ultimately, weaponeering is determining the right weapon and fuse combination to achieve [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1936.84s)]
*  the desired effects and maximum destruction against a target. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1943.56s)]
*  In the case of Fordot, the DITRA team understood with a high degree of confidence the elements [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1948.12s)]
*  of the target required to kill its functions and the weapons were designed, planned and [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1955.16s)]
*  delivered to ensure that they achieve the effects in the mission space. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1961.0s)]
*  By the way, in the beginning of its development, we had so many PhDs working on the MOP program [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1966.68s)]
*  doing modeling and simulation that we were quietly and in a secret way the biggest users [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1974.68s)]
*  of supercomputer hours within the United States of America. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1981.8400000000001s)]
*  So let me talk about the graphic a little bit. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1987.56s)]
*  The GBU-57, which all of you I know know is a 30,000 pound weapon dropped only by the [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1991.48s)]
*  B-2. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=1998.76s)]
*  It's comprised of steel, explosive and a fuse programmed bespokely each weapon to achieve [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2000.08s)]
*  a particular effect inside the target. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2009.0s)]
*  Each weapon had a unique desired impact angle, arrival, final heading and a fuse setting. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2012.16s)]
*  The fuse is effectively what tells the bomb when to function. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2019.92s)]
*  A longer delay in a fuse, the deeper the weapon will penetrate and drive into the target. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2024.24s)]
*  So on Fordot, in June of 2008, you can see these three holes. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2032.66s)]
*  Strictly depicted here is the main exhaust shaft with two additional ventilation shafts [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2039.66s)]
*  on either side. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2044.1000000000001s)]
*  The United States decided to strike these two ventilation shafts, seen here on the main [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2045.9s)]
*  graphic, as the primary point of entry into the mission space. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2050.7000000000003s)]
*  In the days preceding the attack against Fordot, the Iranians attempted to cover the shafts [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2056.42s)]
*  with concrete to try to prevent an attack. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2062.7000000000003s)]
*  I won't share the specific dimensions of the concrete cap, but you should know that [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2067.18s)]
*  we know what the dimensions of those concrete caps were. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2072.7s)]
*  The planners had to account for this. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2077.06s)]
*  They accounted for everything. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2079.8599999999997s)]
*  The cap was forcibly removed by the first weapon and the main shaft was uncovered. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2081.8599999999997s)]
*  Weapons 2, 3, 4, 5 were tasked to enter the main shaft, move down the shaft and then move [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2089.7s)]
*  into the complex at greater than 1,000 feet per second and explode in the mission space. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2097.5s)]
*  Weapon number 6 was designed on each side, so there were six on each side. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2104.7s)]
*  Weapons number 6 was designed as a flex weapon to allow us to cover if one of the preceding [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2110.2599999999998s)]
*  jets or one of the preceding weapons did not work. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2116.54s)]
*  The video I'm about to show you is a culmination of over 15 years of development and testing. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2122.66s)]
*  As I said, hundreds of test shots on various models. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2128.62s)]
*  This is one weapon, so if you take a view of this, five additionals, you'll get a sense [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2133.66s)]
*  of what this looks like. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2140.8199999999997s)]
*  Hopefully you can see it and there's not too much reflection. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2143.9s)]
*  Tom runs our videos out there. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2147.7s)]
*  We'll run it at full speed so you can see it and then go back through it. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2149.86s)]
*  Go ahead, Tom. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2153.86s)]
*  Keep it going for a minute. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2179.86s)]
*  You'll see inside the mission space. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2186.6600000000003s)]
*  Unlike a normal surface bomb, you won't see an impact crater because they're designed [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2198.6600000000003s)]
*  to deeply bury and then function. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2204.1s)]
*  I know there's been a lot of questions about that. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2206.26s)]
*  All six weapons at each vent at Fordow went exactly where they were intended to go. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2209.3s)]
*  A bomb has three effects that causes damage. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2217.1800000000003s)]
*  Blast, fragmentation, and overpressure. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2221.1800000000003s)]
*  In this case, the primary kill mechanism in the mission space was a mix of overpressure [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2224.82s)]
*  and blast ripping through the open tunnels and destroying critical hardware. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2230.3s)]
*  The majority of the damage we assessed based on our extensive modeling was a blast layer [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2235.02s)]
*  combined with the impulse extending from the shock. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2241.18s)]
*  Imagine what this looks like six times over. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2245.82s)]
*  A point that I want to make here, the joint force does not do BDA. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2248.82s)]
*  By design, we don't grade our own homework. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2254.78s)]
*  The intelligence community does. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2257.5s)]
*  But here's what we know following the attacks and the strikes on Fordow. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2259.84s)]
*  First, that the weapons were built, tested, and loaded properly. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2264.2599999999998s)]
*  Two, the weapons were released on speed and on parameters. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2269.3399999999997s)]
*  Three, the weapons all guided to their intended targets and to their intended aim points. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2274.54s)]
*  Four, the weapons functioned as designed, meaning they exploded. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2280.18s)]
*  We know this through other means, intelligence means that we have that we're visibly able [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2284.7799999999997s)]
*  to see them. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2293.38s)]
*  And we know that the trailing jets saw the first weapons function and the pilots stated, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2295.1s)]
*  quote, this was the brightest explosion that I've ever seen. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2300.58s)]
*  It literally looked like daylight. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2304.5s)]
*  Let me now turn to the bomber crews themselves, give you a few details about them. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2307.6600000000003s)]
*  The crews that attacked Fordow were from the active duty Air Force and the Missouri Air [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2312.1800000000003s)]
*  National Guard. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2316.7400000000002s)]
*  The crews ranked from captain to colonel and most were graduates of the Air Force Weapons [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2318.1s)]
*  School headquartered at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2324.46s)]
*  I will state for the record that there is no beach volleyball or football at the Air [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2328.38s)]
*  Force Weapons School. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2334.02s)]
*  They were male and female aviators on this mission. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2336.62s)]
*  And a crew member told me when I talked to them on video the other day that this felt [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2340.2999999999997s)]
*  like the Super Bowl, the thousands of scientists, airmen and maintainers all coming together. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2345.18s)]
*  One last story about people. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2350.8199999999997s)]
*  When the crews went to work on Friday, they kissed their loved ones goodbye, not knowing [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2353.58s)]
*  when or if they'd be home. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2358.02s)]
*  Late on Saturday night, their families became aware of what was happening. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2361.54s)]
*  And on Sunday, when those jets returned from Whiteman, their families were there. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2366.3199999999997s)]
*  Flags flying and tears flowing. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2372.8199999999997s)]
*  I have chills literally talking about this. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2374.42s)]
*  The jets rejoined into a formation of four airplanes followed by a formation of three [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2377.98s)]
*  and came up overhead Whiteman proudly in the traffic pattern, pitching out to land right [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2383.2200000000003s)]
*  over the base and landing to the incredible cheers of their families who sacrifice and [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2389.58s)]
*  serve right alongside their family members. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2396.1s)]
*  Like I said, there were a lot of flags and a lot of tears. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2399.98s)]
*  One commander told me this is a moment in the lives of our families that they will [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2403.38s)]
*  never forget. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2407.94s)]
*  That, my friends, is what America's Joint Force does. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2408.94s)]
*  We think, we develop, we train, we rehearse, we test, we evaluate every single day. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2412.9s)]
*  And when the call comes to deliver, we do so. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2419.8s)]
*  I could not be more proud standing up here today of our Joint Force. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2422.9s)]
*  I'm filled with gratitude that I get to tell their story. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2427.3s)]
*  And as we stand here right now, our forces remain on a high state of readiness in the [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2431.06s)]
*  region, prepared to defend themselves. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2436.9s)]
*  And one last thing, our adversaries around the world should know that there are other [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2439.8s)]
*  DITRA team members out there studying targets for the same amount of time and will continue [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2447.96s)]
*  to do so. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2454.54s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2455.54s)]
*  I apologize for the length. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2456.54s)]
*  I look forward to your questions. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2457.54s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2459.14s)]
*  I would just thank you, by the way, for that extensive work, the lay down. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2460.22s)]
*  I mean, even, do you have that laser pointer? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2464.9s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2466.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2467.7s)]
*  It's squaring me away as always. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2468.7s)]
*  I mean, even in just the public reporting, if you see the post-strike shaft of the three [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2470.74s)]
*  holes, the vast majority, and fairly so, the vast majority speculation has been those are [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2475.7s)]
*  the three strike points. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2480.5s)]
*  When in actuality, what you realize is these are the vents, these are the caps, the first [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2482.64s)]
*  munition took the cap off and the other five went down the center hole, which if you're [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2487.1s)]
*  planning the target, you would want it to be the direct one going to the bottom. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2492.94s)]
*  These are the types of things that go into the planning for a strike that we wouldn't, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2497.2999999999997s)]
*  the Pentagon would not expect the press corps, the American people to initially understand. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2503.54s)]
*  So laying this information out is helpful. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2507.9s)]
*  But it's also why we ask for a beat, for a moment, for a day or two, the opportunity [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2511.1s)]
*  to tell that story because as the chairman said, these men and women that did this mission, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2517.5s)]
*  they just want to do their job. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2521.82s)]
*  They're not expecting their story to be told. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2523.02s)]
*  They're not expecting the glory. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2525.42s)]
*  They are grateful for the flags and the hugs of family. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2526.5s)]
*  That's why they do the job. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2528.7s)]
*  But they also know they were a part of something historic. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2531.9s)]
*  We know how historic it was. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2535.46s)]
*  The chairman does. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2537.1s)]
*  I know. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2538.1s)]
*  Our staffs know. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2539.1s)]
*  That's why we are, and the president of the United States knows. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2540.1s)]
*  And that's why it's almost personal when we see the way in which leaks are used to try [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2544.7s)]
*  to disparage the outcome or muddy the waters about the impact of what happened without [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2551.1s)]
*  being responsible with information and allowing the professionals to assess and provide that [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2556.86s)]
*  information just like the chairman did. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2562.14s)]
*  So thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that information. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2564.1s)]
*  Sure. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2565.98s)]
*  As we see on the screen right now, this is Donald Trump's reaction to this press conference, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2567.62s)]
*  calling it the greatest and most professional and most confirming news conferences. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2572.06s)]
*  There was also a point made during this press conference about images we saw ahead of this [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2577.06s)]
*  strike and whether or not trucks were taking out that enriched uranium, which was the target [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2582.14s)]
*  for these strikes. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2586.9s)]
*  The president also said he believes, according to what he's being told, that those trucks [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2588.04s)]
*  were concrete workers trying to cover up the top of shafts, not necessarily remove [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2594.16s)]
*  them from the area. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2599.3199999999997s)]
*  Again, we're still waiting for confirmation, but this is what the administration is saying. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2600.3199999999997s)]
*  They believe that this is successful and ultimately that they want the narrative to be painted [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2605.6s)]
*  that way as well. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa-UhfUoYn4&t=2610.44s)]
