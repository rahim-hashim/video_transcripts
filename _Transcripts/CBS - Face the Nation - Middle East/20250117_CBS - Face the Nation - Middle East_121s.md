# Gaza ceasefire deal moves to Israel's full cabinet for approval
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4)
*  Welcome back. Thanks for staying with us. Israel's full cabinet is voting right now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=0.0s)]
*  on the ceasefire deal with Hamas. CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Innocencio has [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=4.0600000000000005s)]
*  the latest from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=9.18s)]
*  Notably, Israel's cabinet is meeting after sunset on this Friday, working into Shabbat, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=12.0s)]
*  which is not the norm for observant Jews, which should be a day of rest. But this is [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=18.28s)]
*  indicative of just how important this meeting is to approve or potentially to reject that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=23.54s)]
*  ceasefire and hostage deal. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=29.5s)]
*  Now, the cabinet has been talking with the Israeli negotiating team for the past several [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=31.740000000000002s)]
*  hours from what we understand at least. And going into it, the expectation is that the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=36.38s)]
*  cabinet would approve it. And this is after the smaller security cabinet earlier today [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=40.3s)]
*  recommended approving that deal. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=46.56s)]
*  But that agreement, that talk was not without friction. Two of Netanyahu's cabinet ministers, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=48.74s)]
*  two far right cabinet ministers, mind you, voted the deal down. But that, we know, didn't [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=55.84s)]
*  stop the approval process. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=60.92s)]
*  Now, if this is approved beyond the full cabinet, there would be a 24-hour window where we might [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  expect lawsuits. The legal system might come in here. This would likely be from families [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=68.9s)]
*  who had loved ones killed by any of those Palestinian detainees currently in Israeli [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=74.16s)]
*  do not want to see them go free. If those are resolved, however, we could see hostages [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=80.72s)]
*  out this Sunday. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=87.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Gaza, Israeli airstrikes continued overnight. And the Hamas-run civil defense [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=88.56s)]
*  agency now says that at least 113 people have been killed there since the ceasefire deal [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=93.52s)]
*  was announced just two nights ago. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=99.92s)]
*  But that deal is still not signed, we know, which in effect allows for Israel to keep [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=102.72s)]
*  striking Gaza in its pledge to destroy Hamas. The updated number of dead is now approaching [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=106.92s)]
*  46,800 people. That is according to the health ministry. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=113.04s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_sokWp-R4&t=117.44s)]
