# Netanyahu denounces ICC prosecutor seeking arrest warrant against him
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q)
*  Israel is pressing forward with its military operations in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=0.0s)]
*  This comes a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the International Criminal [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=3.68s)]
*  Court's bid to arrest him over accusations of alleged war crimes in the Gaza conflict. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  President Biden also denounced the move, calling it outrageous. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=15.6s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News foreign correspondent Imtiaz Tayyab, who's with us now from East [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=19.28s)]
*  Jerusalem. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=23.44s)]
*  Imtiaz, great to have you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=24.44s)]
*  Thanks for joining. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=26.2s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu said his country will press forward with its offensive in Ra'afah [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=27.599999999999998s)]
*  despite the international backlash. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=32.16s)]
*  Where are things right now? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=34.6s)]
*  Hey, Lilia. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=36.6s)]
*  Yeah, look, the short answer is things have gotten from dire to even more dire in the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=38.6s)]
*  southern city of Ra'afah. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=45.16s)]
*  Since the 6th of this month, over 800,000 Palestinians who had been sheltering there, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=47.0s)]
*  people who had been displaced not once, not twice, but multiple times, have now been displaced [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=53.12s)]
*  again because the violence there is only widening. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  Now, Israel says that it's carrying out a limited operation in Ra'afah. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=62.64s)]
*  Israel says that it's only carrying out precision strikes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=66.96s)]
*  But if you look at the imagery that's coming out of there, it's anything but. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=69.84s)]
*  The devastation there has been extraordinary. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=74.52s)]
*  In fact, across Gaza, over the past 24 hours, 85 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=77.0s)]
*  strikes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=85.24s)]
*  85 over the past 24 hours. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=86.24s)]
*  And it comes as UNRWA, the UN agency in Gaza assisting Palestinians, has had to suspend [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=90.32s)]
*  operations in Ra'afah as well because the violence there is only increasing. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=96.68s)]
*  The images we're watching, MTS, are all, you know, are many provided by the IDF. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=102.36s)]
*  Israeli officials continue limiting the information coming out of Gaza, now seizing the Associated [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=107.8s)]
*  Press's camera equipment, including a live shot of northern Gaza. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=114.6s)]
*  What do we know about this move? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=119.63999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's an extremely alarming situation and really calls into question press freedom [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=123.72s)]
*  here in Israel, as you rightly point out, that most of what we see in Gaza is from, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=130.28s)]
*  frankly, heroic Palestinian journalists and, of course, from the Israeli military, who [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=136.56s)]
*  provides us with handouts. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  What you don't have is independent journalists, international journalists, operating freely [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=143.64s)]
*  inside Gaza because Israel won't allow us in. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=148.56s)]
*  And the southern border crossing, which is now in control of Israel but normally in control [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=152.6s)]
*  Egypt has also prevented independent journalists from coming in. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=158.28s)]
*  And yet we do have the media operating here in Israel. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  That includes the Associated Press, which is an American wire agency. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  It is obviously one of the most reputable and respected wire agencies in the world, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=169.28s)]
*  which has done incredible work. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=174.16s)]
*  And one of its live feeds of southern Israel, which any of its clients can use, that includes [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=175.76s)]
*  us at CBS, but it also includes companies like Al Jazeera. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=183.24s)]
*  Al Jazeera was running one of its live feeds, and Israel used that, at least apparently, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=187.4s)]
*  as a pretext in order to go into the Associated Press' base in southern Israel, compensate [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  the camera and other equipment under this law that they passed a few weeks ago, which [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=199.84s)]
*  shuttered Al Jazeera. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=205.84s)]
*  Again, part of another example of this growing sense that press freedoms in Israel is shrinking. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=208.52s)]
*  Now, very quickly, I do want to read out a statement from the Associated Press, which [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=215.72s)]
*  says, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=219.72s)]
*  here in Israel, who are furious at this move by the government, Yair Lapid, the main opposition [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=238.6s)]
*  leader, has said this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=244.56s)]
*  This was an act of madness. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=246.84s)]
*  He went on to say, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=249.0s)]
*  That is Yair Lapid, Israel's opposition leader, very angry clearly at this decision by the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=259.16s)]
*  Israeli government to confiscate the Associated Press' equipment while they were broadcasting [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=265.96s)]
*  from inside Israel. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=271.64s)]
*  Alarming indeed. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=272.64s)]
*  MTS, thank you. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8VNftGts4Q&t=273.64s)]
