Video Description: The U.S. Department of Defense said the strikes on Yemen early Sunday targeted Houthi missile systems and launchers, as well as weapons storage and radars used by the Iran-backed group, the latest response to the drone attack last week that killed three Americans, Holly Williams reports. The U.S. appears to be trying to carefully calibrate its response, Williams reports, on the one hand it doesn't want a further escalation of violence in the Middle East, but on the other it doesn't want to risk emboldening its enemies.

# U.S. appearing to carefully calibrate response to attacks by Iran-backed Houthis
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [February 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0)
*  We turn now to our Holly Williams in Irville for more on the escalating conflict in the Mideast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=0.0s)]
*  The US says the strikes on Yemen last night targeted Houthi missile systems and launches [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=6.48s)]
*  as well as weapons storage and radars used by the group. A spokesman for the Houthis who [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=12.0s)]
*  are supported by Iran said the strikes will not deter them. The group says its assault on commercial [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=17.28s)]
*  and naval ships in the Red Sea, which started in November, is an expression of solidarity with [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=23.52s)]
*  Palestinians under bombardment in Gaza. The strikes in Yemen come just one day after the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=29.44s)]
*  US says it hit 85 targets here in Iraq and in neighbouring Syria that are used by Iranian [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  forces and militia groups backed by Iran. There's been an uptick in those militia groups targeting [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=43.52s)]
*  the US military in this region since the Israel-Hamas war began, with around 170 attacks using rockets [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  and drones. The US strikes reportedly killed around 40 people, including both fighters and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=57.12s)]
*  civilians, and were retaliation for the deaths of three American soldiers in a drone attack a week [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=63.76s)]
*  ago at a military outpost in Jordan. There are around 2,500 US troops based here in Iraq and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=69.92s)]
*  around 900 over the border in Syria. Iran called America's response a quote strategic mistake, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  but the question now is whether the militia groups it backs will ratchet things up even [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=86.72s)]
*  further. When we interviewed Iran's foreign minister, Hussein Amir Abdelahian, in November, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=91.92s)]
*  he claimed the militia groups in Iraq and Syria make their own independent calculations and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=97.84s)]
*  decisions. There have long been fears that the Israel-Hamas war could widen into a regional [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=104.24s)]
*  conflict, likely involving Iran's proxies. Ironically, just a few years ago, the US and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=110.16s)]
*  the Iran-backed militia groups were essentially on the same side in a different conflict, the war [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  against ISIS. Now, the US appears to be trying to carefully calibrate its response. On the one hand, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=123.44s)]
*  it doesn't want a further escalation of violence here in the Middle East, but on the other, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  it doesn't want to risk emboldening its enemies. That's Holly Williams in Earville. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbIDqHqp1Z0&t=135.12s)]
