# Details of Israel-Hamas ceasefire, hostage release deal
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI)
*  And you have been watching a CBS News special report on a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=0.0s)]
*  This just happening within the past few moments or so. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=6.32s)]
*  I want to bring in now CBS News contributor Robert Berger. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=9.28s)]
*  He is live in Jerusalem. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=11.84s)]
*  Robert, I want to go over some of the terms of this agreement. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=13.6s)]
*  Thirty three hostages expected to be released from Hamas in the coming days. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=17.04s)]
*  How soon could we see these hostages release? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=23.88s)]
*  We're talking about women, children and senior citizens expected to be among those who are released this weekend. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=26.279999999999998s)]
*  Well, this is a six week ceasefire, so we're going to see a gradual release of these hostages, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=33.8s)]
*  perhaps in batches of three or four with the several days in between. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=39.56s)]
*  The hope is that the first release of three hostages could take place as early as Sunday. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=44.92s)]
*  And also, too, with this agreement, Palestinians will be released from Israeli custody. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=53.8s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=59.28s)]
*  We think the number is around a thousand Palestinian prisoners that would be released over this six weeks, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=61.31999999999999s)]
*  this six week ceasefire, and that includes minors, women and also some militants who are serving life sentences [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=68.92s)]
*  for deadly terrorist attacks on Israelis. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=81.36s)]
*  That, of course, doesn't sit well with the Israeli public. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  But what people are saying is that the government, too, is that that's the price you have to play. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=88.88000000000001s)]
*  You have to pay to get those Israeli hostages home. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  And let's point out 33 is only about a third of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=100.68s)]
*  This is a big win for the Biden administration. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=107.72s)]
*  Just less than a week until a new administration takes over. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=110.04s)]
*  But Margaret Brennan brought up a really interesting point that this deal was actually brokered by members of the Biden team, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=113.36s)]
*  but also the Trump team, too. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=118.56s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=120.64s)]
*  Well, there's been a Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in the region. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=122.44s)]
*  And from what I've heard, kind of twisting arms both here in Israel and in Qatar, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=126.68s)]
*  which to get to put pressure, Qatar being a mediator with Hamas to get them to close a deal before he took office. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=133.0s)]
*  Mr. Trump has famously said that if there wasn't a deal by his inauguration next Monday, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=143.84s)]
*  that there would be all hell to pay. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=150.32s)]
*  And I think that put pressure both on the Arab mediators and on the Israeli government, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=152.24s)]
*  including Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  Now, it's important to note that this deal still needs to go through the Israeli government. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  Can you tell us a little bit about how that process works? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=166.72s)]
*  First, it will go to the cabinet where we're expecting a strong majority to support it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=170.12s)]
*  There are a couple of right wing cabinet ministers who oppose this. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  They don't like the idea of releasing terrorists. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=180.28s)]
*  And they think that that's that's that only encourages more kidnapping. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=183.72s)]
*  But they're going to be in the minority. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=188.76s)]
*  This vote will get through the cabinet and then there will be some legal hurdles to overcome. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=190.64s)]
*  People who oppose the release of the Palestinians can take that to the Supreme Court here in Jerusalem. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=197.6s)]
*  But that will most likely the court will approve that release. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=205.64s)]
*  And that would clear the way for a hostage release beginning as early as Sunday. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=210.92s)]
*  And this deal hopefully will bring an end to this very brutal and bloody war. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=215.72s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people have been killed over the past year, more than a year long war. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=220.12s)]
*  Can you give us some perspective on how just how big a deal this is today? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, on both sides of the border, both in Israel and in Gaza, people are exhausted from this war. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=231.88s)]
*  For the families of the hostages, it's been a huge trial, but actually for the whole country. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, especially the hostage issue, the fact that there are 98 Israeli [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=243.76s)]
*  hostages, 60 of whom are believed to be alive that have been held in these dungeons, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=249.72s)]
*  is something that has hung over the nation really since October 7th, 2023. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=255.48s)]
*  And so there's some relief. But having said that, as I mentioned, there's still going to be [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=262.44s)]
*  if this deal goes through the 33, if they get freed, you still have 65 who are left in Gaza. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=267.72s)]
*  And it's not clear if and when they're going to make it home. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=275.08s)]
*  So what comes next after all of this, Robert? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  There's a 42 day implementation, as Margaret Brennan reported to this ceasefire deal. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=281.92s)]
*  What happens after that? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=287.44s)]
*  OK, so 16 days into this ceasefire, not clear exactly when the starting point is, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  but 16 days after that, negotiations begin on the second phase to release the those 65 Israeli hostages [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=295.48s)]
*  who are left. Probably another 2000 at least Palestinian prisoners would be free during that time. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  And probably an end to the war if all the hostages are returned. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=311.68s)]
*  But frankly, I see that second phase as being quite problematic and not a done deal at all. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=317.64000000000004s)]
*  All right, Robert Berger, coming to us live from Jerusalem. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=324.20000000000005s)]
*  Thank you so much for that insight, sir. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PGHhnHqLI&t=327.08000000000004s)]
