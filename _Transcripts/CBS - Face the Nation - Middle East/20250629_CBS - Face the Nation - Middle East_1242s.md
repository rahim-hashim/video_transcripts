# Full interview: U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Mariano Grossi on Iran's nuclear program
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw)
*  And we go now to the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=0.0s)]
*  IAEA, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=5.7s)]
*  Welcome to the program. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=10.5s)]
*  Thank you very much, Margaret. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=13.26s)]
*  Good to talk to you again. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=14.26s)]
*  Director General, there is so much happening. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=16.22s)]
*  I'm hoping you can walk us through what you know. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister has said that the damage to their nuclear facilities from the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=22.46s)]
*  bombing is significant and serious. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=27.42s)]
*  We know Israel has also killed a number of top Iranian nuclear scientists. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=30.34s)]
*  What exactly is Iran's capability at this moment? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=36.14s)]
*  Well, yes, and I think you can pick and choose any objective to characterize this, but you [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=41.1s)]
*  will see that there is an agreement in describing this as a very serious level of damage. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=47.42s)]
*  It can be described in different ways, but it's clear that what happened in particular [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=55.42s)]
*  in Fordow, Natanz, Isfahan, where Iran used to have and still has to some degree, capabilities [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=60.06s)]
*  in terms of treatment, conversion and enrichment of uranium have been destroyed to an important [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=70.94s)]
*  degree. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=82.42s)]
*  Iran is still standing, so there is, of course, an important setback in terms of those capabilities. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=84.1s)]
*  This is clear. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=94.58s)]
*  And now the important issue, the important thing is what are the next steps. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=95.58s)]
*  Now the characterization of the damage, I think we can speculate and still until, of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=103.06s)]
*  course, the Iranians themselves will have to go there and sift through the rubble and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=110.17999999999999s)]
*  look at what is the exact degree of the damage. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=118.02s)]
*  At some point, the IAEA will have to return, although our job is not to assess damage, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=121.58s)]
*  but to reestablish the knowledge of the activities that take place there and the access to the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  material, which is very, very important, the material that they will be producing if they [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=134.62s)]
*  continue with this activity. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=139.6s)]
*  This is contingent on other, you see, everything is connected. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=141.22s)]
*  This is contingent of negotiations which may or may not restart. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=144.76s)]
*  So what we see this here, I think we have a snapshot of a program which has been very [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=149.4s)]
*  seriously damaged, to quote Dr. Araxi. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=156.16s)]
*  And now what we need to focus on is on the next steps. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  You mentioned there diplomacy. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=165.52s)]
*  President Trump has been calling for diplomatic talks with Iran to settle all the issues around [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=167.32000000000002s)]
*  the nuclear program. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=172.54000000000002s)]
*  I know you were in regular contact with envoy Steve Witkoff. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  Are you talking to him now? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  Will the IAEA be involved in any agreement? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=180.56s)]
*  Well, at some point we will have to be because if his efforts, which I support wholeheartedly, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=184.16000000000003s)]
*  succeed, this will come to a point where there is some agreement, some understanding [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=193.24s)]
*  on things that Iran will continue doing and some things where there could be an agreement [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  on certain restrictions. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=207.08s)]
*  And of course, who is going to verify that is the IAEA. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=208.4s)]
*  So this is why we're in constant contact. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=213.24s)]
*  Now they need to reconnect. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=216.18s)]
*  It's not going to be easy, one can imagine, after the traumatic events that took place. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  Even for us, you may have seen that I wrote to Foreign Minister Araxi a few days ago, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=225.98s)]
*  immediately, I would say, after the ceasefire was considered to be holding. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  I said to him that we should perhaps sit down and analyze in a gradual way the reconnection, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=238.24s)]
*  the modalities for the inspectors to go back. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=249.4s)]
*  So there is a level where the IAEA is not involved and this is the direct conversation. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=254.76000000000002s)]
*  What is the deal? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=260.12s)]
*  And then, of course, we will be connecting to make sure that that deal stands and it's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=261.44s)]
*  verifiable. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=267.16s)]
*  To that point, Tehran just passed a law saying they want to suspend cooperation with the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  IAEA inspectors. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=274.16s)]
*  The Foreign Minister said he has no plans to let you personally, Mr. Director General, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  into the country. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=281.0s)]
*  Does that mean Iran will completely block all inspectors? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  Do those you already have in the country have any access? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=289.0s)]
*  Well, certainly, I hope this is not the case. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=292.32000000000005s)]
*  I think that what the Foreign Minister said is that they were looking into this law and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=295.48s)]
*  how this law would impact our activities. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=300.88s)]
*  I think it's time, this is why it's so important, that we sit down around the table and we look [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=304.6s)]
*  into this. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=311.16s)]
*  Iran, and I think nobody has put that in question and I hope nobody will, is a party to the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, like more than 190 countries in the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=319.32s)]
*  world. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=324.72s)]
*  So that implies that they have to work with the agency. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=325.72s)]
*  So we have to go, we have been going through this law that the MAJ is approved and we see [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=332.24s)]
*  that they are talking about cooperation on the basis of the security and the safety of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=340.16s)]
*  their sites. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  I think that is not incompatible with the inspection work that needs to take place. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  But of course, it's not Raphael Grossi and Margaret Brennan discussing this that we are [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=353.6s)]
*  going to solve it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=359.12s)]
*  I think I have to sit down with Iran and look into this, because at the end of the day, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=360.12s)]
*  this whole thing, after the military strikes, will have to have a long-lasting solution, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=367.76s)]
*  which cannot be but a diplomatic one. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=375.28s)]
*  So they're not kicking out your inspectors at this point? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=377.76s)]
*  Not in this sense. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=382.96s)]
*  I would not say that I am looking with interest and with some concern what they have approved. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=383.96s)]
*  But of course, is there law, is there parliament? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=389.76s)]
*  But here there are legal implications. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=392.59999999999997s)]
*  An international treaty, of course, takes precedence. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=396.0s)]
*  You cannot invoke an internal law not to abide with an international treaty. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=398.4s)]
*  But Iran is not saying that at the moment and I think this is constructive. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=404.0s)]
*  So this is why I think we have to go down into the details, because the work will have [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=408.58s)]
*  to continue. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=413.21999999999997s)]
*  Otherwise nobody will have an idea of what is happening in Iran. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=415.34s)]
*  Iran will continue with a nuclear program, the contours of which are still to be seen [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=420.94s)]
*  and will be, I am sure, part of these negotiations, which I hope will be resuming soon. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=426.9s)]
*  Iran officially reported weeks ago that they were going to take measures in advance of [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=436.78s)]
*  these strikes to try to protect their nuclear assets. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=441.7s)]
*  Did they share with the IAEA what those plans were, where they were going to stash things [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=445.38s)]
*  like centrifuges, the machines that help enrich fuel, where they were going to put the gas [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=452.18s)]
*  canisters that have enriched uranium? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=457.26s)]
*  No, no. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=459.94s)]
*  They did not inform that to us, but at the same time there was no physical time perhaps [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=461.54s)]
*  to do it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=468.74s)]
*  Iran, for example, had announced to us that they had a new enrichment facility in Isfahan [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=469.74s)]
*  and we were going to go on the 13th of June to check on that facility. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=476.14000000000004s)]
*  And the site has been severely damaged and hit. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=483.22s)]
*  So this is why I say it is indispensable. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=487.88s)]
*  We will have to, aggravation or not, feelings and emotions or not, there has to come a point [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=491.5s)]
*  with cool heads, we sit around the table and see what, I mean, these protective measures, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=498.1s)]
*  of course, is there a right to protect their assets like any other sovereign nation? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=505.24s)]
*  They can, of course, protect, but they know and there are, I don't want to get too technical [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=509.8s)]
*  or legalist here in this conversation, but there are provisions in the agreements we [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=514.88s)]
*  have not only with Iran, with any country. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=519.48s)]
*  If a country at a moment feels that some of the things we inspect must be protected or [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=522.4399999999999s)]
*  whatever, they have to tell us and we have to go, et cetera, et cetera, as you can imagine. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=529.04s)]
*  So this could not happen because of the unfolding of the circumstances of a military conflict, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=534.38s)]
*  where of course, decisions are taken and this is not planned or announced, obviously. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=540.4s)]
*  So now it's the time to reconnect and to talk and to talk to each other. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=546.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=552.3199999999999s)]
*  But there was roughly 400 kilograms, which is just under 900 pounds of highly enriched [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=553.3199999999999s)]
*  uranium before the attacks. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=558.24s)]
*  I know these are in small canisters and relatively easy to move. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=561.92s)]
*  Do you have any idea where that was moved and if it was moved before the attack? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=566.56s)]
*  We presume, and I think it's logical to presume that when they announce that they are going [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=572.7399999999999s)]
*  to be taking protective measures, this could be part of it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=581.4399999999999s)]
*  But as I said, we don't know where this material could be or if part of it could have been [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=587.5799999999999s)]
*  under the attack during those 12 days. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=596.68s)]
*  So some could have been destroyed as part of the attack, but some could have been moved. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=600.64s)]
*  So there has to be at some point a clarification. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=607.1999999999999s)]
*  If we don't get that clarification, this will continue to be hanging over our heads as a [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=612.0799999999999s)]
*  potential problem. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=619.56s)]
*  So this is why I say it's so important, first of all, for Iran to allow our inspectors to [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=620.56s)]
*  continue their indispensable work as soon as possible. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=628.68s)]
*  Well I ask you about what things might still remain because there's that open question [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=633.9599999999999s)]
*  of could Iran sprint towards a bomb even now if they wanted to? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=639.9799999999999s)]
*  If we don't know where the Hylenrich uranium is and cannot account for all the centrifuges, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=646.08s)]
*  is there still a risk that they could be rushing towards a bomb? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=652.88s)]
*  Well we don't want to be alarmists here and I don't want to be part of a messaging that [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=657.84s)]
*  would be spreading, as I say, alarm. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=667.9200000000001s)]
*  But we need to be in a position to assert, to confirm what is there and where is it and [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=674.22s)]
*  what happened. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=683.38s)]
*  Iran had a very vast, ambitious program and part of it may still be there and if not, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=684.9s)]
*  there is also the self-evident truth that the knowledge is there, the industrial capacity [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=694.1800000000001s)]
*  is there. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=702.26s)]
*  Iran is a very sophisticated country in terms of nuclear technology, as is obvious. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=703.54s)]
*  So you cannot disinvent this, you cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=709.06s)]
*  that you have. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=714.8199999999999s)]
*  It's a huge country, isn't it? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=715.8199999999999s)]
*  So I think this should be the incentive that we all must have to understand that military [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=718.3199999999999s)]
*  operations are not. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=727.92s)]
*  You are not going to solve this in a definitive way militarily. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=728.92s)]
*  You are going to have an agreement. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=733.7199999999999s)]
*  You are going to have an inspection system that will give everybody, everybody in the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=736.0799999999999s)]
*  region and elsewhere, the assurances that we can definitely turn the page. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=741.68s)]
*  So up until right before the strikes, the IAEA still had inspectors, as I understand [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  going to some of these sites. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=757.5400000000001s)]
*  There's been a lot of focus here in America on the trucks and satellite images of them [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=759.82s)]
*  outside of Fordow. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=764.9200000000001s)]
*  What was happening in those days before the strike? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=767.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, as you were pointing out, there was an announcement of protective measures that [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=770.34s)]
*  could have included moving equipment and material. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=778.0200000000001s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=784.58s)]
*  We saw the same images that the whole world has seen of these trucks. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=785.58s)]
*  And we don't want to get into any rash conclusion about it. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=791.7s)]
*  But it is clear that we need things that we ignore. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=796.72s)]
*  And after a reasonable period after the war, there has to be a process that needs to continue. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=804.0600000000001s)]
*  Otherwise, the uncertainties will continue. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=812.66s)]
*  We continue to linger on. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=815.86s)]
*  And this is, in a final analysis, not good and perhaps even preventing a good agreement. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=818.32s)]
*  Because who is going to have an agreement when you don't know what the counterpart really [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=826.02s)]
*  has? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=830.82s)]
*  What are the assets that they really have after this military campaign that took place? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=831.82s)]
*  Up until these strikes, Iran was still disclosing information to the IAEA in certain amounts. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=838.9s)]
*  There were deficits. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=849.02s)]
*  There were deficits. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=850.02s)]
*  And we were referring to those in the sense that there were some things that they were [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=851.18s)]
*  not clarifying to us. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=855.86s)]
*  But our inspection work was constant. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=857.66s)]
*  In particular, in this sensitive area of the number of centrifuges and the amount of material, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=861.26s)]
*  we had perfect view. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=867.5s)]
*  We didn't have view on other things that we wanted to have. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=869.3s)]
*  But on this one, it was complete. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=872.86s)]
*  It was comprehensive. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=875.74s)]
*  And of course, at the moment, there is nothing. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=878.5s)]
*  Well, Iran wasn't keeping its stockpile of enriched uranium secret. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=881.54s)]
*  The world was concerned. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=886.78s)]
*  No. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=887.98s)]
*  You said you were concerned about it. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=888.98s)]
*  What do you think it was intended for? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=890.84s)]
*  And did you see anything that suggested they were looking to weaponize? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=892.7s)]
*  Let me be clear here, because we said, first of all, something very, very important. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=900.46s)]
*  They have all these capabilities, but for the agency, first of all, they didn't have [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=906.62s)]
*  nuclear weapons. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=912.22s)]
*  OK? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=913.22s)]
*  This needs to be said. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=914.22s)]
*  One can have an assessment nationally that they were close. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=916.4200000000001s)]
*  OK? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=920.86s)]
*  And I don't get into that because the IEA does not judge intentions. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=922.02s)]
*  The IEA looks at the activities of a country and reports it to the world. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=927.38s)]
*  So it is countries that say, well, this is of concern or not. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=932.94s)]
*  What we were concerning, what I was concerned about is that there were other things that [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=937.9s)]
*  were not clear. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=943.86s)]
*  For example, we have found traces of uranium in some places in Iran, which were not the [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=944.86s)]
*  normal declared facilities. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=951.66s)]
*  And we were asking for years, why did we find these traces of enriched uranium in place [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=954.9s)]
*  X, Y or Z? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=966.06s)]
*  And we were simply not getting credible answers. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=968.14s)]
*  If there was material, where is this material? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=971.3s)]
*  So there could be even more. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=974.06s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=975.86s)]
*  This is why it is. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=976.86s)]
*  I'm sorry I'm repeating it for the third time. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=978.42s)]
*  I think we need to go back. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=980.5799999999999s)]
*  Understood. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=982.02s)]
*  Understood. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=983.02s)]
*  But your statement and that report that you gave about some of these open questions or [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=984.02s)]
*  unanswered questions, the Iranians are pointing to it now. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=989.2199999999999s)]
*  And the foreign minister seems to be sort of blaming you for the military strikes. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=993.38s)]
*  He said it wasn't honest and fair, your report. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=996.9399999999999s)]
*  He said after the facilities, you didn't even condemn the strikes after the strikes, I should [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1000.62s)]
*  say. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1005.8199999999999s)]
*  What do you make of those criticisms? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1006.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, to an extent, I understand they have been under attack. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1009.18s)]
*  But really, who can believe that this conflict happened because of a report of the IAEA? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1014.14s)]
*  And by the way, what was in that report was not new, Margaret. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1021.3399999999999s)]
*  We have been saying that for a long time and in previous reports as well. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1026.8999999999999s)]
*  So this maybe it's because it's easier maybe to criticize an international organization [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1032.58s)]
*  or a director general. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1038.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1039.86s)]
*  But it's not reasonable to say that. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1040.86s)]
*  And if anything, the IAEA, as always, has had a very honest assessment of the situation. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1045.58s)]
*  And there were many, I can assure you, there were many that were saying in your report, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1053.66s)]
*  you must say that they have nuclear weapons or they are very close to have nuclear weapons. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1060.14s)]
*  And we didn't. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1065.26s)]
*  We simply didn't because this was not what we were seeing. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1066.66s)]
*  But you also said you couldn't verify that it was a peaceful program. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1070.14s)]
*  Absolutely, because we have to say everything. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1073.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1075.98s)]
*  They did. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1076.98s)]
*  We didn't see them. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1077.98s)]
*  We didn't see a program that was aiming in that direction. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1078.98s)]
*  But at the same time, they were not answering very, very important questions that were pending. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1083.6200000000001s)]
*  So this is the truth. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1090.1000000000001s)]
*  And I appreciate the nuance here because there's so much gray. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1094.3400000000001s)]
*  People here are looking for clarity and there's confusion in the United States. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1098.1000000000001s)]
*  CBS is reporting that the Defense Intelligence Agency assesses Iran's program was set back [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1102.94s)]
*  a few months, but once they dig out, they could resume in a number of months. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1108.5400000000002s)]
*  They have to rebuild electrical and water supplies. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1113.8200000000002s)]
*  The CIA and the national intelligence directors say the facilities were destroyed and it would [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1116.14s)]
*  take years to rebuild. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1120.94s)]
*  Michael says the military program is set back many years. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1122.9s)]
*  What's the truth here? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1127.7800000000002s)]
*  What do you make of these assessments? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1129.0600000000002s)]
*  You know what? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1131.42s)]
*  This hourglass approach in weapons of mass destruction is not a good idea. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1132.6200000000001s)]
*  Remember we had cases, 45 minutes and so on, which were quite off spot. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1139.8200000000002s)]
*  All of that depends on your metrics, Margaret. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1147.74s)]
*  If you tell me it will take them two months or three months for what? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1152.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1156.3s)]
*  The capacities they have are there. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1157.3s)]
*  They can have, you know, in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1161.22s)]
*  spinning and producing enriched uranium or less than that. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1170.82s)]
*  But as I said, frankly speaking, one cannot claim that everything has disappeared and [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1177.98s)]
*  there is nothing there because, first of all, as I think the intelligence, we are not there [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1182.98s)]
*  making any military evaluations, first of all, but out of the logic of our conversation. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1188.98s)]
*  It is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage, first of all. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1194.98s)]
*  And secondly, Iran has the capacities there, industrial and technological capacities. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1201.22s)]
*  So if they so wish, they will be able to start doing this again. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1205.58s)]
*  This is again, and I'm sorry, fourth time we have to go back to the table and have a [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1210.9399999999998s)]
*  technically sound solution to this. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1217.82s)]
*  Otherwise, this will come hit us again in terms of a situation which is not well clarified. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1220.9399999999998s)]
*  And this is an opportunity. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1227.82s)]
*  We do have an opportunity now. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1228.9399999999998s)]
*  Understood. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1231.3400000000001s)]
*  And we will see if that opportunity is picked up by either side. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1231.8400000000001s)]
*  Director General, thank you for your time today. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1236.46s)]
*  As always, a pleasure. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1239.1000000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG8F9Wr5sw&t=1239.9s)]
