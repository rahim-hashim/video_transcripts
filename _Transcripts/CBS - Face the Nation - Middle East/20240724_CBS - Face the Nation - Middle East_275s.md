# Netanyahu thanks Speaker Mike Johnson for inviting him to address Congress
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I)
*  Well Scott, we want to show our viewers right now live, thanking you for your report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=0.0s)]
*  This is Mike Johnson meeting in real time with the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=4.0s)]
*  Let's listen in and see what they have to say. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=8.0s)]
*  ...from the UN and the media. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=10.0s)]
*  Today and every day, Americans must stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel in its great struggle. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=12.0s)]
*  In this struggle, nearly 300 days after October 7th, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=19.0s)]
*  our hearts remain with the 120 men and women, boys and girls who are still in captivity in Gaza. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=24.0s)]
*  Adon, Iltae, Saji, Hirsch, Gadi, Judy, Omer, Keith, and so many others are being held deep in tunnels. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=30.0s)]
*  We have not forgotten them, or their families, who so desperately want them home, and we of course do as well. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=40.0s)]
*  Israel and the United States are united in our mission to bring them home, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=46.0s)]
*  and I have full confidence that we will do just that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=50.0s)]
*  I have to say it's providential that the Prime Minister is here today after the 17th of Tammuz. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=53.0s)]
*  It was nearly 2,000 years ago that the most powerful nation in the ancient world [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=58.0s)]
*  laid siege to Israel and destroyed Solomon's Temple. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=63.0s)]
*  But today, the most powerful nation in the modern world is standing with our Jewish friends and the Israeli government. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=66.0s)]
*  I'm certainly eager, as we all are, to hear from the Prime Minister, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=74.0s)]
*  and as we hope that this 17th of Tammuz marks the last time that Jewish people lament destruction [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=78.0s)]
*  so that they can live freely and securely in their ancestral homeland. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=84.0s)]
*  I would defer to the Prime Minister for any remarks. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=89.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=92.0s)]
*  Speaker Johnson, you have shown great leadership, along with the leaders of the Senate and the minority leader in the House. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=94.0s)]
*  I appreciate the fact that you've invited me to address this great assembly, the world's greatest democracy. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=107.0s)]
*  The Congress of the United States speaks for the American people, and the American people speak for the entire world. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=116.0s)]
*  I very much value this opportunity to address this August Forum. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=124.0s)]
*  You said just now something that resonates throughout the ages. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=130.0s)]
*  Almost 2,000 years ago, the Romans breached the walls of Jerusalem. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=135.0s)]
*  On this day, almost 2,000 years ago. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=140.0s)]
*  Well, our enemies will not breach our walls today. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=143.0s)]
*  And our wall is not made up only of our own soldiers, our brave heroes, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=148.0s)]
*  but also the friendship and alliance with the great United States of America. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=154.0s)]
*  That is very much expressed here today, and I thank you for giving me this opportunity. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=161.0s)]
*  And the people of Israel, thank you for giving us this opportunity to express our common alliance. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=166.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=171.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. Thank you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=173.0s)]
*  All right, so there you have it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=180.0s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson right there giving a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=181.0s)]
*  I want to go back to Scott McFarland. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=187.0s)]
*  Scott, you were likely able to listen into that just a little bit and hear that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=189.0s)]
*  You know, whenever a foreign leader comes to the United States, talks to lawmakers, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=193.0s)]
*  lawmakers who have their hands on the purse strings, so to speak, they want something. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=196.0s)]
*  What is in it specifically for Benjamin Netanyahu? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=200.0s)]
*  He needs Congress's help with foreign aid, Reid. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=205.0s)]
*  They have provided billions of dollars of aid for humanitarian needs, for military needs, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=208.0s)]
*  and Congress is having a real difficult time this year funding anything. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=214.0s)]
*  So he is facing a gridlock Congress trying to prod them to continue the aid packages. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=218.0s)]
*  Another one would come due September 30th. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=224.0s)]
*  But also, there's a political statement here. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=226.0s)]
*  You saw him side by side with Speaker Mike Johnson right outside the Speaker's main office on the second floor of the Capitol there. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=229.0s)]
*  Mike Johnson is the one who extended this invite. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=235.0s)]
*  He got the Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to agree to support this invitation, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=238.0s)]
*  but Mike Johnson's fingertips are all over this thing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=243.0s)]
*  And he is trying to galvanize political support for Republicans to continue to support Israel, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=246.0s)]
*  to get past any opposition in their districts, and to be vocal supporters of more aid for Israel. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=252.0s)]
*  It's going to become a heavier and heavier lift as this year goes along. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=260.0s)]
*  And a narrative we will hear more and more about. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=263.0s)]
*  We know that former President Donald Trump will be meeting with Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=265.0s)]
*  with a peace through strength position on that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=270.0s)]
*  Scott McFarland, thank you so much. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKhpNLQl1I&t=273.0s)]
