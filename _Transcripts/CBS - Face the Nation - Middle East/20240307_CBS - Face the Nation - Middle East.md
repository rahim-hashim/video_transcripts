# Biden to announce plan to build temporary port on Gaza coast for aid delivery
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [March 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM)
*  Now, one of the key issues President Biden will be focusing in tonight's State of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=0.0s)]
*  Union address is the U.S. is standing on the global stage. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=4.28s)]
*  The Biden administration's foreign policy agenda has taken some hits, with Congress [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=8.64s)]
*  failing to pass a new funding package to support Ukraine at a crucial moment. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=13.16s)]
*  It also faces an uphill battle in the Middle East, where the president is pushing for Israel [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=18.0s)]
*  and Hamas to agree to terms for a hostage release and a ceasefire. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=22.64s)]
*  Let's bring in Sam Vinograd now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=27.32s)]
*  She's a CBS News contributor and a former assistant secretary for counterterrorism, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=28.76s)]
*  threat prevention and law enforcement policy for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=33.28s)]
*  Sam, great to see you from our D.C. bureau this afternoon. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=38.0s)]
*  We are hearing now that President Biden is set to announce the construction of a port [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=42.42s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=47.24s)]
*  Why is this so crucial to his foreign policy agenda? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=48.74s)]
*  Well, this really does underscore that the drafting of the State of the Union really [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  does come down to the midnight hour. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=56.12s)]
*  We understand that President Biden is set to announce the build of a port in northern [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=59.58s)]
*  Gaza to get more aid to Palestinians. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  Five months since Hamas' brutal terrorist attack against the state of Israel, we know [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=67.64s)]
*  that there is an urgent need to return Israeli hostages and there is an urgent need to cease [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=74.02s)]
*  humanitarian aid can go through border crossings and reach Palestinians in need. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=81.16s)]
*  At the same time, in the absence of a ceasefire, we also know that there are 570,000 people [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  at risk of starvation in Gaza. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  I'm a board member at Save the Children and they've advised me that one in six children [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=95.6s)]
*  in Gaza are at risk of starvation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=101.12s)]
*  And building a port, which will, I should note, take several weeks, is really indicative [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=103.52s)]
*  of the president and his administration and our allies using every means possible to alleviate [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  humanitarian impacts of Israel's activities in Gaza. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=114.44s)]
*  Now, we should note we don't know exactly how this port will be built, who will be responsible [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=118.68s)]
*  for security at the port itself once it is constructed, and who will be responsible ultimately [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=124.42s)]
*  for distributing supplies. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=129.94s)]
*  We know that there was a horrific tragedy in Gaza just a few days ago when aid trucks [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=131.54s)]
*  came under, when Palestinians came under fire trying to get food at aid trucks, so the details [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=138.54s)]
*  are going to be quite important here. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=143.38s)]
*  Right, Sam, so there's a little bit of dissonance in what you're saying. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=144.78s)]
*  On one hand, there's starvation, there's an urgent need for aid, there was a recent aid [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=147.82s)]
*  effort that led to civilians being killed. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=152.22s)]
*  And on the other hand, while building a port sounds great, those questions of how it will [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=155.22s)]
*  be built and who will be responsible for it are pretty crucial. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=160.54s)]
*  As someone who's been in the White House and watched these decisions unfold, help us understand [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=163.57999999999998s)]
*  how we get to this point where it will be announced, but the details still seem scarce. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=168.42s)]
*  Well, typically, prior to a president making an announcement like this, let's look back [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=173.42s)]
*  to 2013 when I was in the White House and President Obama announced a drawdown, a further [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=178.42s)]
*  drawdown of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=182.94s)]
*  Prior to an announcement like that or an announcement about building a port in Gaza, those obvious [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=185.54s)]
*  operational plans have been presented to the president so that he isn't boxed in making [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=190.54s)]
*  an announcement at this scale in the middle of a State of the Union without the details [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=195.54s)]
*  being hammered out. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=199.78s)]
*  So I would assume that there was a National Security Council meeting with the president [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=200.78s)]
*  in which operational plans were presented, the risks were presented, and detailed plans [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=205.86s)]
*  were presented to the president so that he understands how this would work, how it would [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=211.46s)]
*  impact the U.S. military, what kind of funding is needed. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=215.86s)]
*  I believe a port like this would probably cost about $100 million to build, and so that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=219.29999999999998s)]
*  he had a really good understanding of operationally how this would work and what kind of impact [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=223.94s)]
*  it would have with 570,000 people at risk of starvation in Gaza. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=229.85999999999999s)]
*  The need for adequate supplies is significant, and if the president has decided to use, let's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=235.05999999999997s)]
*  say, an amphibious warship anchored off the coast of Gaza, that would be one way to get [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  real mass quantities of supplies into the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=246.3s)]
*  I want to ask you about some of the expected or invited guests to the State of the Union. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=249.14s)]
*  President Biden invited Ukraine's first lady, also the widow of Alexei Navalny, the Russian [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=253.74s)]
*  dissident. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=259.06s)]
*  They were unavailable. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=260.58s)]
*  The Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson's guests include the parents of Evan Koskovich [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=261.9s)]
*  and an Israeli hostage released by Hamas after 54 days. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=267.82s)]
*  What does that tell us about kind of the stagecraft of what we will witness tonight? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=271.22s)]
*  Well, I should note that this so-to State of the Union is unique in the sense that the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=276.42s)]
*  content of the speech is important, but perhaps what's equally, if not more important in the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=281.46s)]
*  State of the Union is a president's delivery. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=286.38s)]
*  So it's clear from the invited guests that Russia, Ukraine, and in addition we know that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=288.98s)]
*  there are guests that have been affected by IVF and other reproductive issues, that those [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=296.38s)]
*  issues are going to play a key role in the State of the Union. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=301.94s)]
*  But separate apart from the actual content, the eyes of the world are going to be on how [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=305.14000000000004s)]
*  the president actually delivers this speech. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=309.42s)]
*  It is a lengthy speech that's going to hit a lot of topics. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=312.42s)]
*  Having been involved in drafting, there is an attempt to avoid a Christmas tree effect [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=315.14000000000004s)]
*  in the laundry list of topics, but how the president delivers the content here is going [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=320.66s)]
*  to be key. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=325.42s)]
*  We know that the Middle East, Russia, and Ukraine, and likely China will factor prominently [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=326.46000000000004s)]
*  into his remarks and the guests really do underscore that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Z08vuaaNM&t=331.82s)]
