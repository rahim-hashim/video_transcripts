# Israel hits Gaza with new airstrikes, ending 2-month ceasefire
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg)
*  The Arab world is condemning Israel after it launched a new series of deadly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=0.0s)]
*  airstrikes across Gaza in spite of the fragile ceasefire that's been in place [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=3.62s)]
*  since January. Gaza's health ministry claims more than 400 people died in the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  overnight raids. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he ordered the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=11.94s)]
*  strikes after Hamas rejected a proposal to extend the first phase of the cease [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=15.88s)]
*  fire and refused to release the remaining Israeli hostages. Hamas wanted [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=19.8s)]
*  second phase negotiations to begin and is blaming the U. S. For providing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=24.42s)]
*  unconditional military support to Israel. CBS News national security [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=27.84s)]
*  contributor Sam Vinograd joins us now. So Sam, a statement from Netanyahu's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=31.96s)]
*  office says Israel was resuming strikes because of Hamas's repeated [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=36.2s)]
*  refusals to release hostages and its rejection of all offers from envoy [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=39.32s)]
*  Steve Witkoff and mediators. What's their strategy here? Well, Hamas's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=43.64s)]
*  strategy has seemed to be to try to get Israel to just agree to a permanent [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  cessation of hostilities on Hamas's terms. The flip side here is that Israel [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=52.28s)]
*  has been very focused on only talking about a permanent ceasefire if and only [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=57.32s)]
*  if Hamas agrees to leave the Gaza Strip and or to dismantle its military [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=62.56s)]
*  leadership. That is a big gap between the two parties. And so what we've had [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=68.04s)]
*  over the past several weeks since phase one ended, Lindsay, is Hamas refusing [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=72.76s)]
*  to accede to Israel's demands and Israel indicating that for the for [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=77.3s)]
*  phase one to continue, hostages had to be released. That did not occur. And [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=82.52s)]
*  now we have resumed strikes. We don't know if these strikes are an effort to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=86.4s)]
*  get Hamas back to the negotiating table in a meaningful way or are a new phase [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=91.12s)]
*  of the war. So does this mean that we are potentially further from a potential [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=95.4s)]
*  phase two of a ceasefire? We just don't know at this point. Again, this could be [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=99.68s)]
*  a negotiating tactic, a pressure campaign, or it could mean that Israel [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=103.84s)]
*  has given up on negotiations and is purely trying to obliterate Hamas and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  change its military strategy in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli military order [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=112.6s)]
*  people to evacuate eastern Gaza and head toward the center of the territory. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=116.55999999999999s)]
*  Does that tell you that a ground offensive could be imminent? It certainly [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=119.96s)]
*  indicates that there will be prolonged strikes and that what occurred [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=123.52s)]
*  overnight was not a one off event. We should expect more Israeli military [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=126.52s)]
*  activity as the Israelis assess that at least for now diplomacy has failed to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=130.28s)]
*  achieve a last meaningful objective. Turning now to the call between [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=134.85999999999999s)]
*  President Trump and Putin. How significant of a step toward peace is [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=138.2s)]
*  this if Ukraine isn't at the table right now? Well, ostensibly the United States [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=141.66s)]
*  is negotiating with Ukraine and Russia at the same time. Ukraine's already [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=146.18s)]
*  agreed to the 30 day ceasefire proposal. The United States just got Putin to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=149.94s)]
*  agree ostensibly to an energy ceasefire. So no more military strikes against [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=154.06s)]
*  energy infrastructure. And the reality is that the United States has a lot of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=157.9s)]
*  leverage over Ukraine when it comes to getting Ukraine to also agree to an [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=161.9s)]
*  energy ceasefire because U. S. Provides intelligence and security assistance to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=165.38s)]
*  Ukraine. So I think that this was a step towards a bridging proposal and the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=169.78s)]
*  Ukrainians are likely going to be on board with this proposal. All right, Sam [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  Benigrad, thank you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFCC6OBMfxg&t=177.7s)]
