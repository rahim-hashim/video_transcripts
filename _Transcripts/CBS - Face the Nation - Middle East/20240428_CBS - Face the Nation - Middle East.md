# Campus protests and free speech battles become latest frontline in Israel-Hamas war
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E)
*  Our Mark Strassman reports on those college campus protests that have erupted across the country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=0.0s)]
*  All the clamor on campus keeps spreading. A clash of more than ideas. Riot gear at Ohio State. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=7.44s)]
*  Tasers at Emory University in Atlanta. Mostly pro-Palestinian protesters, at times scuffling [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  with police, waved on by school administrators with hundreds of arrests. Communities like the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=23.6s)]
*  University of Texas turning on each other. Israel's war on Hamas has another front line. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=29.6s)]
*  A free speech and hate speech campus debate that's anything but academic. If you want to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  protect free speech then you don't break up peaceful protests. People didn't seem to be aware [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=45.84s)]
*  of how bad the situation for free speech and academic freedom already was on campus until [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=50.72s)]
*  October 7th. Greg Lukianoff of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a group [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=55.28s)]
*  defending the right to free speech. Do you have the sense that any of this is moving the ball [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  forward? Some of the ways the protest has been going on on college campuses has been alienating [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  more of the public than bringing it in. On Columbia University's West Lawn, civil disobedience, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=72.0s)]
*  this ongoing tent city, galvanized national protests. They want the university to divest [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=78.8s)]
*  investments in Israel and companies they say profit off repression of Palestinians. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=85.2s)]
*  Dueling protests at Columbia, pro-Israel, pro-Palestinian, reflect a larger welter [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=92.56s)]
*  of opinion and emotion, passion and perceived prejudice. People would be up in arms and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=98.4s)]
*  protesting that right away but because it's the Jews I feel like nobody cares. All this coast to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=104.24s)]
*  coast commotion is well into its second week and what began here at Columbia has now rippled [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  overseas. From Paris to London university students occupied buildings and marched in the streets. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=116.32s)]
*  They're echoing this U.S. student movement at times a moment that's been unflattering even dark [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=124.08s)]
*  from intolerant protesters to stumbling universities. A lot of campuses are teaching [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=130.96s)]
*  young people to think like activists and less like scholars. When you're reduced to just shouting [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=137.28s)]
*  at each other that is a failure of some of the things that makes higher education so special. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l5OtHtZ5E&t=143.44s)]
