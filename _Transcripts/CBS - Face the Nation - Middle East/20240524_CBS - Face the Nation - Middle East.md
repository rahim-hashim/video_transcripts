# Will Israel comply with ICJ's order to halt Rafah operations?
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY)
*  The UN's top court has ordered Israel to immediately halt its operations in southern Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=0.0s)]
*  The International Court of Justice says the Israeli military must withdraw its troops from Ra'afa. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=5.12s)]
*  It is also calling for the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages Hamas [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=10.8s)]
*  is holding within the war-torn territory. The ruling came down just hours after the Israeli [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=14.96s)]
*  army said it recovered the bodies of three additional hostages from Gaza. Initial reports [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=19.68s)]
*  reveal the three victims were killed during the October 7th attack. Their bodies were taken back [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=24.8s)]
*  to the territory after the assault. Meanwhile, Israel is ramping up its strikes on the war-torn [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=29.44s)]
*  enclave. At least a dozen people are dead after an aid distribution center in central Gaza was hit [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=34.56s)]
*  multiple times overnight. Let's bring in CBS News foreign correspondent MTS Tayyab in East Jerusalem. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  So MTS, will Israel comply with the ISTJ's order? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=45.44s)]
*  The short answer is no, it will not. Aside from its official statements from its own defense [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=52.08s)]
*  minister, we have reporting now from our colleagues who are in Gaza who can tell us that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=58.56s)]
*  there are, and I'm quoting here Lindsay, unprecedented levels of bombing going on in Ra'afa [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=64.48s)]
*  right now. Specifically areas of the Shabora camp and around the Kuwaiti hospital, making it very [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=72.56s)]
*  clear that Israel will not be heeding the ICJ's orders to stop its assault on Ra'afa. Ra'afa were [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=80.08s)]
*  around 400,000 civilians are currently sheltering. What more are we learning MTS about the recovery [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=87.28s)]
*  of the three bodies of hostages from Gaza? That's right, the remains of three hostages were found by [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  the Israeli military in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, in the same area where the remains [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=105.04s)]
*  of three other Israeli hostages were found earlier this week. It's not, it's rather not [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=111.28s)]
*  insignificant that they were found in Jabalia where Israel re-entered just a few weeks ago [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=119.2s)]
*  to battle what it's been describing as a resurgent Hamas and now we're hearing that the remains of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=125.44s)]
*  these hostages have now been found. Now we've heard from the father of one of those hostages [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=132.48s)]
*  who has been calling on the Israeli military to put aside politics and to free everyone [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=139.52s)]
*  still in Gaza. So that said, French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting officials from several [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  key Arab states today to discuss a ceasefire in Gaza. This follows Israel ordering its war [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  cabinet to re-engage in hostage release negotiations. So does this signal to you a new push for ceasefire [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=157.84s)]
*  talks? Yeah, it's very clear that the Israeli government is on a huge amount of pressure to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=163.2s)]
*  restart those talks now that we are starting to receive the remains of hostages, many who were [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  killed on October 7th. All of that of course has been animating these mass demonstrations that we've [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=178.16s)]
*  been seeing all across Israel here in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and in towns and cities across Israel. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=184.56s)]
*  Many Israelis will say that they relive October 7th over and over again because on any street you [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=190.8s)]
*  drive down in Tel Aviv and elsewhere you will see posters of these hostages. In fact we were speaking [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  to one of the sisters of the five Israeli female soldiers who were seen in a video that these [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=203.12s)]
*  families released just earlier this week showing them as they were taken into Gaza by Hamas saying [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=211.44s)]
*  that she doesn't want her sister to be remembered as a poster. She wants her sister to be known as [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=218.8s)]
*  a person, a person that is still inside Gaza and that her government has the power to free if only [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  they come to a deal with Hamas. And those negotiations as you say are ongoing international [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=232.4s)]
*  negotiations not only involving the U.S. and indeed other western powers but also Qatar and Egypt [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=238.4s)]
*  who are saying to Hamas and of course working with Israel to try to come up with some sort of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=245.28s)]
*  agreement which will see a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages. That was such a powerful [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  interview. Our thanks to you and your crew for bringing that to us. MTS Tyab, thank you. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzGLuxT8tY&t=257.04s)]
