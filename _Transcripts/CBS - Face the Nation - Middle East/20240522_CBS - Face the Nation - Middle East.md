# Israel condemns Spain, Ireland and Norway's recognition of Palestinian state
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA)
*  We begin our report in Europe, where three nations have made a gesture to the Palestinians. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=0.0s)]
*  The leaders of Spain, Ireland and Norway said they will recognize a Palestinian state, which [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=5.92s)]
*  they had not done before. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=10.96s)]
*  The Wednesday announcements come seven and a half months after the start of the war in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=12.08s)]
*  Gaza and despite Israel's repeated objections. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=16.16s)]
*  They join more than a dozen European nations that have already done so. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=19.72s)]
*  Many countries, including the United States, advocate for a two-state solution, but the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=23.8s)]
*  Biden administration argues the move must be negotiated. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=28.68s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent, MTS Tyab, has more. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=32.44s)]
*  MTS. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=36.16s)]
*  Well, this is an extraordinary move by the leaders of these three countries to formally [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=37.16s)]
*  recognize a Palestinian state. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=42.0s)]
*  In a statement, they all collectively said that this was a time for peace and made it [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=45.0s)]
*  clear that they believe that peace and safety could only be achieved through the recognition [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  of a Palestinian state and indeed the safety of future generations of Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=56.7s)]
*  But of course, as we've been hearing, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=64.14s)]
*  with fury saying that this was not the time to recognize a Palestinian state, saying that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=69.02000000000001s)]
*  it was quote a reward for Hamas. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=74.66s)]
*  In fact, we've heard from Israel's finance minister saying that he will also suspend [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=78.18s)]
*  tax transfer payments to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=83.66s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority in the West Bank is already strapped for money, and this is [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=88.42s)]
*  certainly going to be a very punitive measure for them. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=92.25999999999999s)]
*  But we have to be clear between a potential arrest warrant for alleged war crimes that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=96.5s)]
*  the ICC is pursuing for Prime Minister Netanyahu, the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=101.78s)]
*  state by these European powers. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=107.97999999999999s)]
*  And we've been hearing anguish pleas from hostage families to bring their loved ones [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=110.54s)]
*  home. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=115.66000000000001s)]
*  The Israeli leadership, Prime Minister Netanyahu specifically, is under extraordinary pressure [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=116.66000000000001s)]
*  from all sides as he desperately tries to cling on to power. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=122.54s)]
*  John. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=127.22s)]
*  Imtiaz Tayyab, thank you. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=128.22s)]
*  And now we go to CBS News Chief Foreign Affairs correspondent and Face the Nation moderator [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  Margaret Brennan who joins me. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=135.22s)]
*  Margaret, help me understand what Norway, Ireland and Spain are up to here, the role this plays [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=137.54s)]
*  in this question of a Palestinian state and is this purely symbolic? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=143.54s)]
*  Well, John, it's symbolic in that it doesn't have a practical implication on the ground [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=147.74s)]
*  for independence, but it is aspirational and shows that Israel is increasingly isolated. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=152.36s)]
*  It's now like 140 of the 190 countries at the UN have recognized a Palestinian state. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=158.26s)]
*  The United States says they want one, but as the result of a negotiated settlement with [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=165.73999999999998s)]
*  Israel to work out how this would actually take place, they also currently, the Biden [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  administration are trying to have a complete revitalization of the Palestinian Authority, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=176.5s)]
*  which is the governing entity in the West Bank, so that it has younger, more capable, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=181.94s)]
*  less corrupt officials running it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=187.14s)]
*  But this is also something that there are members of the War Cabinet who are supportive [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=190.06s)]
*  of within Israel. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=194.78s)]
*  You had the defense minister of Israel, Galant, coming out and saying that this needs to be [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=196.22s)]
*  talked about. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=201.52s)]
*  Who's going to run this place? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=202.52s)]
*  Gaza, after Israeli troops leave. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=203.66s)]
*  And that debate over whether Israel would actually try to take over control and hold [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=205.94s)]
*  it is something that far-right nationalist ministers of the Netanyahu government are [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=211.5s)]
*  pressing for. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=216.44s)]
*  And that's why this is also so delicate. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=217.44s)]
*  Adding to this discussion is the question of Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=220.02s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke about efforts to normalize relations between Israel [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=224.66s)]
*  and Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=228.45999999999998s)]
*  Here's some of what he said. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=229.45999999999998s)]
*  In order for normalization to proceed, Saudi Arabia has made very clear that even with [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=231.78s)]
*  the agreements between us completed, they have to have two things. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=235.98s)]
*  They have to have calm in Gaza and they have to have a credible pathway to a Palestinian [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=239.38s)]
*  state. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=243.38s)]
*  Whether a government in Israel in this moment is able to engage on that basis, I don't [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=244.38s)]
*  know. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=252.7s)]
*  So, there we hear it again. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=253.7s)]
*  Support for a Palestinian state. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=255.85999999999999s)]
*  How do you read into, there were a lot of ums in Blinken's testimony. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=257.46s)]
*  How do you read into the ums and the delicate dance the U.S. is trying to do here with the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=260.7s)]
*  Saudis? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=266.9s)]
*  Oh, that was very delicate, John. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=267.9s)]
*  And I really would have loved a sharp follow-up question to the I don't know because Antony [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=269.38s)]
*  Blinken was really trying to avoid taking on the complications within the Israeli political [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=274.94s)]
*  system right now when he was answering that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=279.28s)]
*  And also avoid saying that Prime Minister Netanyahu has been completely defiant of all [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  requests to date that President Biden has been making of him, including on this, which [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=288.35999999999996s)]
*  President Biden has sought as this sort of crown achievement to deliver to Israel a security [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=293.08s)]
*  compact by normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia, the most influential and important [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=299.0s)]
*  Arab Muslim country in the world. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=304.7s)]
*  That's the carrot that President Biden is dangling out there saying, hey, if you want [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=307.44s)]
*  to cement your legacy as actually making Israel more secure, then perhaps do this and compromise [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=312.18s)]
*  on the Palestinian state element of this. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=320.04s)]
*  But it is not at all clear that Prime Minister Netanyahu would make that calculation. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=323.34000000000003s)]
*  And in fact, the Biden administration officials have increasingly been saying that they believe [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=329.12s)]
*  he is making calculations based on his own political survival and not necessarily the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=333.52s)]
*  security of the state. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  And you heard a member of his war cabinet suggest as much as well. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=340.52s)]
*  Benny Gantz gesturing to it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=344.32s)]
*  Let me switch to Ukraine before you have to go, Margaret. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=346.32s)]
*  Last week, Blinken visited Kyiv to reiterate U.S. support for Ukraine. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=350.0s)]
*  What for you is the what is the key issue right now in that conflict that you're paying [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=353.56s)]
*  attention to? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=358.64s)]
*  Well, John, the ambassador from Ukraine was on Face the Nation this weekend and said there's [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=360.44s)]
*  no such thing as fast enough when it comes to delivery of weapons. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=364.36s)]
*  The reason that this moment is so sensitive is because of that delay and of six months [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=367.44s)]
*  or more in delivery. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=373.38s)]
*  And Russia has really been able to exploit it in a significant way. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=375.08s)]
*  At a time when Ukraine is even short on troops, they just rolled over rolled out a new draft, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=379.36s)]
*  for example. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=384.56s)]
*  So they need everything, include on the weapons front, including air cover. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=385.62s)]
*  They're asking for two Patriot systems. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=390.62s)]
*  They're asking for other kind of support as well, including training of their troops, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=392.46s)]
*  more of it and where that takes place, who does it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=399.66s)]
*  All of that is still being worked out. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=402.42s)]
*  And President Zelensky wants, at least based on his remarks in The New York Times, on Tuesday, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=404.74s)]
*  he wants NATO to shoot down Russian missiles that have entered Ukrainian airspace. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=411.18s)]
*  He says, that's just defending us. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=415.26s)]
*  That's not an aggressive act. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=416.9s)]
*  How big of an ask really, though, is that for Zelensky? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=418.28s)]
*  Bigger than anything NATO has been willing to do to date. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=422.14s)]
*  That New York Times interview, he laid out a number of prescriptive things that NATO [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=425.42s)]
*  has just not been willing to do, the Biden administration has not been willing to do. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=430.02s)]
*  And he points out that the United States was willing to do that for Israel, for example. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=433.3s)]
*  Israel's an ally of the United States. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=438.9s)]
*  Ukraine is not a treaty ally of the United States, nor is it part of NATO. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=441.54s)]
*  And the United States to date has really been trying to walk that line of not escalating. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=446.26000000000005s)]
*  Using anything under the NATO brand is super sensitive because Vladimir Putin's trumped-up [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=451.70000000000005s)]
*  version of events is that he's at war with NATO, and the U.S. doesn't want to give cover [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=457.54s)]
*  for any of that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  And that applies as well to the training of troops, whether those are conducted by NATO [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=463.96000000000004s)]
*  or whether those are conducted by members of NATO is parsed here. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=469.88s)]
*  Diplomats are OK with members of NATO doing training. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=474.28000000000003s)]
*  They're a little more sensitive when anything under the NATO umbrella gets involved. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=477.0s)]
*  Base the Nations, Margaret Brennan. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=481.76s)]
*  Thank you so much, Margaret. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=483.24s)]
*  Thanks, John. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urIne5zHbrA&t=484.24s)]
