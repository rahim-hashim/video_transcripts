# Mixed messages from Israel after Trump ceasefire announcement
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU)
*  It has been a little more than a week since President Trump announced a ceasefire between [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel and Iran. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=4.8s)]
*  The two countries fought for 12 days, launching strikes at each other. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=6.38s)]
*  Israel said its goal was to destroy Iran's nuclear program. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=10.94s)]
*  The U.S. did not take part at first, but President Trump eventually joined Israel by attacking [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  three Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=19.76s)]
*  The Trump administration claims Iran's program was obliterated, but Iran says it is still [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  assessing the extent of the damage. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=27.16s)]
*  And the head of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog says the country may be able to resume enriching [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=29.48s)]
*  uranium within months. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  Mona Yukubian is a senior advisor and director of the Middle East program at the Center for [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=37.6s)]
*  Strategic and International Studies. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=42.5s)]
*  Mona, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=44.56s)]
*  One week later, does it appear the ceasefire is holding? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=46.96s)]
*  Yes, it does appear the ceasefire is holding. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=50.2s)]
*  There's been no exchange of fire, no claims of violations. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=53.6s)]
*  But we are entering into a period, I think, of escalating tensions. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=58.24s)]
*  And so we're going to have to watch very, very closely in the coming days. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=62.5s)]
*  Do you see any opportunity for diplomacy between the U.S. and Iran or Iran and Israel? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=67.54s)]
*  I think there had been clearly some opportunity for diplomacy between the U.S. and Iran. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=73.64s)]
*  And Trump spoke of that possibility right after the ceasefire was initiated. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=79.4s)]
*  But unfortunately, I think now we're seeing not only the rhetoric, but actions going in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=84.64s)]
*  the other direction, especially with Iran's announcement today that it was suspending [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=91.56s)]
*  cooperation with the IAEA, the nuclear watchdog. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=97.04s)]
*  And Mona, Iran has suspended cooperation, as you mentioned, with the U.N. agency that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=103.2s)]
*  monitors its nuclear program. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=106.84s)]
*  How significant is that? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=108.68s)]
*  I think it's very important. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=111.64s)]
*  First, it's without the IAEA ability to go in and observe and supervise what's going [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=113.4s)]
*  on on the ground or monitor what's happened on the ground, we can't know for sure the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=120.36000000000001s)]
*  extent of the damage done to Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=125.92000000000002s)]
*  So that's the first point. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=129.88s)]
*  The second is that that cooperation is essential for any talks to go forward and will be core [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=131.44s)]
*  to any deal that's negotiated, because it will necessarily include the need to be able [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=138.44000000000003s)]
*  to monitor Iran's nuclear activity going forward. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=144.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, looking ahead, what are you going to be looking out for in the days and weeks? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  I think we'll be watching Iran's actions and words very, very closely. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=154.72000000000003s)]
*  Is there any indication that Iran is beginning to somehow resume any activity, any attempt [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  to rebuild its nuclear facilities? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=167.16s)]
*  How do the Israelis respond to what we're seeing so far? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=169.72s)]
*  Where does President Trump stand on all of this? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=173.28s)]
*  We'll be watching very, very closely, in particular, though, I think both the words and the actions [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=175.72s)]
*  of Iran going forward. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=180.84s)]
*  All right, Mona, you could be and thank you so much. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK49FHUOIVU&t=182.44s)]
