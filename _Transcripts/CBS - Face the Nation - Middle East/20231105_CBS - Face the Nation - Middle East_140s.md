# War between Israel and Hamas is fueling anger in the U.S. as hate incidents rise
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8)
*  The war in the Middle East has fueled anger and outrage in the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=0.0s)]
*  Our Mark Strassman reports. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=4.0s)]
*  Furies march. Pro-Palestinians, tens of thousands of them, rallying this weekend in Washington. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=6.0s)]
*  Palestine won't be free! [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=14.0s)]
*  Sentiment simmering here, but seething elsewhere. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=17.0s)]
*  Venom and menace on the prowl, elbowing aside empathy and grace. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=21.0s)]
*  From in-person bullying to online barbarity. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=28.0s)]
*  From the first Hamas gunshot on October 7th, the internet became a welter of hatreds, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=34.0s)]
*  scuttering across mainstream and extremist platforms. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=40.0s)]
*  In London, Hannah Rose with ISD, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, monitors online hate speech. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=44.0s)]
*  It's still far higher than at regular levels. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=52.0s)]
*  And is that true of all hate speech? Muslims, Jews as targets? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=55.0s)]
*  It's true of anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hatred. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=59.0s)]
*  In the three days after the initial Hamas attack, ISD reports anti-Semitic comments on conflict-related YouTube videos, increased by almost 5,000 percent. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=62.0s)]
*  Anti-Muslim keywords spiked more than 400 percent. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=74.0s)]
*  What we know about online anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hatred is that it never stays online. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=78.0s)]
*  A Palestinian-American boy of six stabbed to death near Chicago. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=84.0s)]
*  His attacker reportedly yelled, you Muslims must die. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=89.0s)]
*  In New York, this suspect allegedly punched a woman in the face. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=93.0s)]
*  He told her, because you are Jewish. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=97.0s)]
*  America's Jewish community is understandably skittish. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=100.0s)]
*  Less than 3 percent of the country's population, they're the targets of roughly 60 percent of all religious hate crimes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=104.0s)]
*  And that was before the October 7th Hamas attacks. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=111.0s)]
*  This is a threat that is reaching in some way sort of historic levels. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=114.0s)]
*  FBI Director Christopher Wray testified this week the threat is real. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=118.0s)]
*  This is not a time for panic, but it is a time for vigilance. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=123.0s)]
*  Everyday Americans a half world away from Gaza, but caught in the crossfire, including horrifically a six-year-old boy. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm7N8XpQi8&t=128.0s)]
