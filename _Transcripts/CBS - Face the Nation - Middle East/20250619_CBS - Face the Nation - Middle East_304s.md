# Pentagon beefing up U.S. military presence in Middle East amid Israel-Iran conflict
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4)
*  All right, so CBS News national security correspondent not far from where Willie is. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=0.0s)]
*  He's over the Pentagon now. Charlie, the Pentagon is where the pulse of the military really [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  beats the strongest and the hardest. What are the preparations? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=8.88s)]
*  Well, you know, interestingly, it's Juneteenth and I can't remember a time I've walked through [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=14.32s)]
*  the building and haven't seen a single soul. I saw one person when I was here in this building that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=19.12s)]
*  houses potentially 27,000 people, if that's any indication at all. However, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=24.479999999999997s)]
*  the DOD is in the business of preparing for war. It's what they do every day. So the idea that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  they might be preparing for military action there in that combatant command, central command, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=36.72s)]
*  I can tell you that the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group is in place and with it a whole slew [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=42.0s)]
*  of destroyers, cruisers, F-18s, F-35s, that's already there. In addition, there are two other [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=48.24s)]
*  carrier strike groups that are headed in that direction. One of them, the Nimitz, which is [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=54.96s)]
*  coming out of Indo-Pacom or in the Indo-Pacific, sorry, getting all military here. Another one [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  headed to the European command area, the Gerald R. Ford. And with it, once again, you will have [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=64.56s)]
*  those assets. They always travel with essentially a flotilla of destroyers. Destroyers, by the way, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=70.8s)]
*  that have already been active in the defense of Israel for incoming missiles from Iran. So you've [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=76.32s)]
*  got a couple off the coast of the Mediterranean. You got a number of them in the Red Sea. That's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  important because of the Houthi presence there, because this isn't just about providing force [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=87.36s)]
*  protection for as many as 40,000 U.S. forces that are spread throughout that area. But it's to have [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=92.24s)]
*  a military presence, a sort of forward operating military presence. Yes, it's a show of force, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=99.83999999999999s)]
*  and we do know that there are more aircraft on the way, specifically F-16s, F-22s, F-35s. So when [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=105.6s)]
*  you start looking at the big picture, because what the defense secretary is trying to do is to give [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=113.6s)]
*  the White House as many options as possible. It's not just the weaponry that's headed there, but the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  kinds of weapons. There are refueling tanks that were sent, tankers, I should say, that were sent [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=122.88s)]
*  a few days ago. This is important and critical because it allows fighter aircraft to loiter [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=128.88s)]
*  among on top of areas where they're for force protection, but it also gives long-range bombers [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=134.88s)]
*  a longer range if they should be called in for any kind of potential fight. Charlie, if I'm the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  parent of a young man or a young woman who is stationed anywhere in the Middle East, I am wondering [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=147.92s)]
*  what the reality is for my son or my daughter. What are you hearing about the number of troops [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  there, their readiness, their capability, and what the reality is for them right now? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=159.52s)]
*  Yeah, well first of all, Reid, I think we have to kind of break that down to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  the kind of military installations that we're talking about. So if you say, you know, my son [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=169.68s)]
*  or daughter are based in Bahrain, right, where the 5th Fleet is based, that is going to be a heavily [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=174.4s)]
*  fortified naval base. It's got several layers of defense throughout the UAE, parts of Kuwait. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=179.76s)]
*  These are firmly established large U.S. military bases, including the ones in Qatar and UAE. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=189.76s)]
*  Where there is more of a vulnerability are the places like Al-Assad, which has already come [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=197.28s)]
*  under attack. Now this is a base inside Iraq itself, about 2,500 service members there. There's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  another base in northern Iraq near Erbil. Again, that has come under attack. And I'll remind you, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=207.44s)]
*  Al-Assad came under the largest ballistic missile attack from Iran after Soleimani was assassinated, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=213.2s)]
*  again under President Trump's watch. So they have shown that they can attack those bases. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=220.56s)]
*  There were a lot of TBI's injuries because of the ferocity of the attack, but that is a vulnerability. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=227.44s)]
*  Now what are they doing in terms of reinforcing that? They also have to be worried about Iranian-backed [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=234.88s)]
*  proxies. So as I understand it, it's been told to me by U.S. officials, they'll have more [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=239.84s)]
*  fortification outside. They've got to be keeping an eye on, you know, car bombs, mortars, any of the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=244.48s)]
*  bad actors, of which there are several in that Iraq region. So you know, the further out you go to more [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=250.24s)]
*  of a sort of combat outpost rather than a huge military installation, there is a vulnerability [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=256.32s)]
*  there, not just from Iran, but from Iranian-based proxies. And of course, we can't rule out the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=261.68s)]
*  Houthis. We have U.S. warships within reach of the Houthis, and they have attacked before. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=267.36s)]
*  That's been put on hold, but they may rejoin this fight if Iran were to come under attack. So you [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=274.16s)]
*  know, first and foremost, this is about force protection. As I'm told, even though they're [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=279.36s)]
*  flooding this area with U.S. military assets, that is to protect U.S. forces in the region, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  not necessarily putting themselves in an offensive position. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  Charlie Daggett, outside the Pentagon. On this Juneteenth, thank you so much for that update. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=294.72s)]
*  So much to keep track of. So many pieces there on the board. We appreciate it so very much. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1S6J6XY4&t=299.28000000000003s)]
