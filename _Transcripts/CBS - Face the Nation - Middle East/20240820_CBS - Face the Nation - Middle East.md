# Blinken on latest Gaza cease-fire talks, says Israel agreed to bridging proposal
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [August 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig)
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken is speaking in Doha, Qatar, about efforts to secure a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=0.0s)]
*  ceasefire deal in the Middle East. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=6.44s)]
*  The ceasefire can make good on the commitments that they've made in the agreement. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=7.44s)]
*  So that's a process that's ongoing at the same time. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=12.96s)]
*  We're engaged every single day with Israel, and our Qatari and Egyptian partners are engaged [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=16.54s)]
*  with Hamas. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=23.44s)]
*  Over the coming days, we are going to do everything possible to, one, get Hamas on board with [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=26.759999999999998s)]
*  the bridging proposal, and then to make sure that both parties work on and agree to necessary [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=33.48s)]
*  details of implementation that would allow everything to go forward. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=41.56s)]
*  So that's where we are, and I just returned to what I started with, which is a strong [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=45.64s)]
*  commitment on the part of the United States, Egypt, Qatar, and for that matter, many other [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=52.96s)]
*  countries, on the fierce urgency of now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=59.28s)]
*  This needs to get done, and it needs to get done in the days ahead, and we will do everything [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=62.68s)]
*  possible to get it across the finish line. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=66.86s)]
*  Tom. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=69.86s)]
*  Tom. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=70.86s)]
*  Well, Tom, here's what I can say first, going back to the very early days when we put out [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=100.86s)]
*  the so-called Tokyo principles about the future. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=107.86s)]
*  One of them is very clear that the United States does not accept any long-term occupation [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=114.86s)]
*  of Gaza by Israel. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=121.86s)]
*  The United States does not accept any long-term occupation of Gaza by Israel. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=124.86s)]
*  More specifically, the agreement is very clear on the schedule and the locations of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=129.86s)]
*  IDF withdrawals from Gaza, and Israel has agreed to that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=136.86s)]
*  So that's as much as I know. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=141.86s)]
*  That's what I'm very clear about. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=144.86s)]
*  Again, I'm not going to go into details of the details, but I'm going to say that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=147.86s)]
*  I'm not going to get into the details of the agreement, but it is laid out in the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=154.86s)]
*  agreement, an agreement that Israel has endorsed, and it is specific as to the locations and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=164.86s)]
*  the schedule for withdrawals. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=170.86s)]
*  I can't speak to the details. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=173.86s)]
*  I can't speak to what he's quoted as saying. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=184.86s)]
*  I can just speak to what I heard from him directly yesterday when we spent three hours [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=187.86s)]
*  together, including, again, Israel's endorsement of the bridging proposal and thus the detailed [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=192.86s)]
*  plan, and that plan, among other things, as I said, includes a very clear schedule and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=199.86s)]
*  locations for withdrawals. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=206.86s)]
*  The other thing is it's so clearly in the interest of all concern, starting with Israel, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=209.86s)]
*  to bring this to a close, and I think that was also reflected in the conversation that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=217.86s)]
*  I had. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=222.86s)]
*  The hostages depend on it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=223.86s)]
*  The security of the country depends on it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=225.86s)]
*  The ability to really ensure that we don't have the conflict spreading to other places, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=227.86s)]
*  because Gaza is in many ways the key to making sure that we can actually move things in the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=233.86s)]
*  north, in Lebanon and Hezbollah in a better direction. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=238.86s)]
*  It's the key to helping make sure that we can take down the temperature in the Red Sea [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=242.86s)]
*  with the Houthis. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=246.86s)]
*  It's the key to seeing if we can pursue a normalization agreement between Israel and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=247.86s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, which both countries remain very interested in. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=251.86s)]
*  It's the key to actually putting everyone, starting with Israel, on a path to greater [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=255.86s)]
*  peace and security. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=262.86s)]
*  And of course, it's key to getting the hostages home, which Israelis desperately want to see [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=264.86s)]
*  happen, and we want to see happen. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=270.86s)]
*  We need to see happen. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=272.86s)]
*  There are Americans who remain hostage in Gaza, and I was very clear about the American [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=273.86s)]
*  interest in making sure that our people come home to their families and that the remains [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=278.86s)]
*  of those who have perished are brought back. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=283.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=286.86s)]
*  Robert. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=288.86s)]
*  If this bridging proposal was endorsed and agreed to by both the Egyptians and Qataris, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=290.86s)]
*  can you help us understand how the proposal was advanced over the course of your stops [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=295.86s)]
*  today? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=299.86s)]
*  And you've received the assurances from Israel, and you've had the support of Egypt and Qatar [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=300.86s)]
*  as negotiating partners and intermediaries. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=304.86s)]
*  Has the needle moved at all when it comes to Hamas, and are you more confident today [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=308.86s)]
*  that they will agree to this proposal when you left Israel? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=312.86s)]
*  And if I may, what are your expectations as to the outcomes of talks over the next coming [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=315.86s)]
*  days when negotiators are such a weak link? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=319.86s)]
*  So the bridging proposal was put forward on behalf of all three of our countries. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=323.86s)]
*  The United States put it forward with the full support of Egypt and Qatar. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=329.86s)]
*  And what's happening now is, among other things, both Egypt and Qatar, in their engagements [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=333.86s)]
*  with Hamas, making very clear as necessary what's in that proposal, explaining it as [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=340.86s)]
*  necessary, if there's any confusion, so that Hamas fully understands it and agrees to it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=348.86s)]
*  As I said before, the bridging proposal is based on the May, the late May agreement that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=358.86s)]
*  President Biden put out, endorsed and incorporated in the U.N. Security Council resolution. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=365.86s)]
*  And then we heard from both parties different comments on it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=371.86s)]
*  We tried to reflect some of those comments in this bridging proposal. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=376.86s)]
*  And a bridge, by definition, has two parties to it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=380.86s)]
*  There are two points to a bridge. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=386.86s)]
*  So we've tried to reflect that in the bridging proposal. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=389.86s)]
*  And now the process is making sure that Hamas fully understands it and what's in it. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=392.86s)]
*  And I believe that they should, again, they should be prepared to endorse it, just as Israel is endorsed it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=398.86s)]
*  And then the critical thing is getting clear understandings on implementation of the agreement. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=405.86s)]
*  And there are some complicated pieces of business that are involved there. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=412.86s)]
*  That's exactly why it's so important that the negotiators who are working the details of this [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=418.86s)]
*  have maximum flexibility from the Israeli government and also from Hamas's leadership, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=423.86s)]
*  so that we can actually bring this to a conclusion, bring it over the finish line. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=431.86s)]
*  And in this, as I said, the United States, Egypt and Qatar are absolutely united. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=436.86s)]
*  But they have a unique role in being able to engage with Hamas. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=441.86s)]
*  We, of course, are deeply engaged with Israel. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=446.86s)]
*  And the three of us working together, I believe, can get this to where it needs to go. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=449.86s)]
*  But as always, these things sometimes take more time than you want. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=456.86s)]
*  What we are all united on is the urgency of the moment, because, as I said, with every passing day, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=462.86s)]
*  more bad things can happen to more good people who don't deserve it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=469.86s)]
*  And we're united in that, and we're going to continue to do the work. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=474.86s)]
*  There's one other thing I should actually have shared with all of you, which is that, of course, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=479.86s)]
*  we were intensely focused on Gaza during this visit. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=483.86s)]
*  But in Egypt in particular, but also here in Qatar, we had extensive discussions about Sudan. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=488.86s)]
*  And it's very important that people focus on that, too, because with everything else going on in the world, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=494.86s)]
*  the worst humanitarian situation in the world right now is in Sudan. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=501.86s)]
*  There are more people in Sudan who are suffering from fighting, from violence, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=505.86s)]
*  from lack of access to food and basic humanitarian assistance. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=511.86s)]
*  And we are very determined to try to move that to a better place as well. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=516.86s)]
*  We convened talks in Switzerland that are ongoing. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=521.86s)]
*  At the same time, we've been working very closely with Egypt, with Saudi Arabia, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=525.86s)]
*  with the United Arab Emirates, with the African Union, not only to try to get a cessation of hostilities [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=531.86s)]
*  and bring the parties together around that and a way to verify the agreements that they hopefully will reach, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=539.86s)]
*  but also to get humanitarian assistance into the tens of millions of people who need it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=545.86s)]
*  We have an agreement now over the last couple of days that critical access points in Sudan [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=552.86s)]
*  to allow humanitarian assistance to get in will be opened by both the SAF and the RSF, the two competing parties. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=558.86s)]
*  And we obviously need to see that move forward, but that's critical in bringing life-essential assistance to people who desperately need it. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=568.86s)]
*  And as we're doing that, of course, we're working on trying to get a broader agreement on a cessation of hostilities. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=577.86s)]
*  And there, again, the work and the coordination with Egypt has been absolutely critical. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=582.86s)]
*  And I didn't want to leave this without telling you that this is something that we spent a fair bit of time on as well. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=587.86s)]
*  Thanks, everybody. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=592.86s)]
*  Thanks, guys. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=593.86s)]
*  We've been listening to Secretary of State Blinken there on the tarmac in Doha, Qatar. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=598.86s)]
*  This is part of his on-the-ground diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=608.86s)]
*  He did confirm that Israel has already agreed to the bridging proposal. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=613.86s)]
*  It's now in Hamas' court. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=617.86s)]
*  Hamas has been working with Egypt and Qatar to communicate. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=619.86s)]
*  And so he says the time is now. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=623.86s)]
*  They are all united in their urgency. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=625.86s)]
*  He also mentioned the humanitarian crisis in Sudan. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=627.86s)]
*  Much more news at the top of the hour. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=629.86s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvuguCLHpig&t=631.86s)]
