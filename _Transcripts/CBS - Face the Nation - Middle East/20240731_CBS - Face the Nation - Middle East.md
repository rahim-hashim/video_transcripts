# Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh's assassination in Iran draws reactions
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0)
*  Meanwhile, we expect to hear more from the White House today about growing concerns of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=0.0s)]
*  a conflict in the Middle East that could spread to the region. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  And top of mind, this headline, the killing of a top Hamas leader in Iran. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  So Iran blames Israel, who so far has not owned that strike. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=12.52s)]
*  That leader was in Iran's capital city for the swearing in of Iran's president when the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=16.36s)]
*  airstrike hit. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=20.14s)]
*  But this is an escalation Secretary of State Atty. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=21.62s)]
*  Blinken has tried to avoid. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=23.92s)]
*  In fact, we just got these comments from the Secretary of State from his post in Singapore. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  Well, of course, I've seen the reports. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=30.64s)]
*  And all I can tell you right now is I think nothing takes away from the importance of, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  as I said a moment ago, getting to the ceasefire, which is manifestly in the interest of the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=40.92s)]
*  hostages and bringing them home. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=48.04s)]
*  It's manifestly in the interest of Palestinians who are suffering terribly every single day. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  Children, women, men in Gaza who've been caught in this crossfire of Hamas' making. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=54.48s)]
*  It's profoundly in the interest of trying to put things on a better path, not only in [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  Gaza but actually throughout the region. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=67.72s)]
*  He's on a better path than trying to keep a lid on all of this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=70.12s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News correspondent Imtiaz Tayyab. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=73.52s)]
*  Imtiaz, you're in Beirut. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=76.12s)]
*  This strike in Iran follows a strike where you are in Beirut. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=78.22s)]
*  What is the response there in Beirut and also out of Iran today? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=82.1s)]
*  Yeah, Reid. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  Fury is the answer. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  There is fury here in Lebanon. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=93.69999999999999s)]
*  There's fury, of course, from Hamas and Gaza and fury from Tehran following these two assassinations, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=95.38s)]
*  which really has sort of pushed us to a place where we haven't been in a very long time [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=102.74s)]
*  which is this concern that we could see a wider war spread across the region involving [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=110.54s)]
*  actors who are incredibly well-armed and incredibly powerful and incredibly determined to fight. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=117.04s)]
*  Now, as we've been hearing from the secretary, that he said that it was in the interest of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=123.38000000000001s)]
*  everybody to try to de-escalate the situation. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=127.26s)]
*  But when we focus on the assassination of Ismail Haneeh in Iran, in Iranian territory, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=130.58s)]
*  as a guest of the Iranians attending the inauguration of the new Iranian president, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=136.5s)]
*  not only is this a major breakdown of Iran's security apparatus, it is devastatingly humiliating [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=142.3s)]
*  for them as well. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=148.98s)]
*  Now, many, of course, fearing that Iran will carry up some sort of retaliatory attack, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=150.58s)]
*  but we've been hearing from sources inside Iran that at this very moment the Iranian [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=155.62s)]
*  leadership is really trying to understand how this security breakdown could happen, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=160.62s)]
*  that Ismail Haneeh could be assassinated inside their home, as they described it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=165.98000000000002s)]
*  And so, many are hoping that any kind of retaliation, if it's going to come, won't come soon, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=171.3s)]
*  but that doesn't mean the situation here is any less tense. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=177.26000000000002s)]
*  Of course, the issue with the worries of a widening regional conflict, very much top [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=180.3s)]
*  of mind of leaders, but also we understand there is some reporting that the person who [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=185.66000000000003s)]
*  was killed in Iran was part of some talks, some hostage release negotiation talks, and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=190.74s)]
*  now those talks relative to the release of hostages could be in jeopardy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=196.98000000000002s)]
*  What do you know about that? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=200.3s)]
*  Yeah, no, look, let's be clear. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=201.3s)]
*  Ismail Haneeh is one of the most well-known Hamas leaders. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=206.3s)]
*  He was the political leader and has a very long history in Palestinian politics and, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=210.34s)]
*  of course, with Hamas, and he was the lead negotiator. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=215.34s)]
*  This is a man who negotiated indirectly with the U.S., indirectly with Israel. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=220.38s)]
*  And he's widely seen, relative to Hamas, it has to be said, but widely seen as far [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=226.7s)]
*  more pragmatic than the military leaders inside of Hamas who are directing the war in Gaza, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=231.74s)]
*  which we've seen, is so devastating. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=237.98000000000002s)]
*  So the fact that Ismail Haneeh would be assassinated by Israel, although, as we've been saying, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=240.18s)]
*  Israel remaining silent, not saying anything about it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=245.42000000000002s)]
*  Although, of course, Hamas and Iran saying that they're behind this assassination. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=248.66s)]
*  The fact that he's been killed, the man who is negotiating with Israel, with the U.S., [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=254.1s)]
*  albeit indirectly, says, or at least we've been hearing from the Hamas leadership and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=260.1s)]
*  from others as well, that to kill somebody who was so directly involved with the negotiations, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  that these negotiations are all but dead. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=271.9s)]
*  Jim Tiaz-Tejab, thank you so much for that live report. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=275.86s)]
*  The world watches and waits. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-Tn9pzzx0&t=278.78000000000003s)]
