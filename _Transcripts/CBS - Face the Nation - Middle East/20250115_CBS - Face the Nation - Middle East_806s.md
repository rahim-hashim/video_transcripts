# Israel and Hamas agree on ceasefire and hostage release deal, U.S. officials say
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ)
*  This is a CBS News special report. I'm Errol Barnett. We have breaking news for you coming out of the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire and hostage deal after 15 months of war. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=7.28s)]
*  This deal comes after many months of negotiations brokered through the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=13.68s)]
*  This chapter of the conflict began, you may remember, when Hamas orchestrated a terror attack on Israeli soil back in October of 2023. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  That killed 1200 and they took another 250 people hostage. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=28.4s)]
*  Nearly 100 hostages are still inside Gaza and at least a third are believed to be dead. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=33.12s)]
*  Now the Hamas-led attack also led to an Israeli military invasion into Gaza that killed more than 46,000 Palestinians. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=38.4s)]
*  We want to bring in Face the Nation moderator and our Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent, Margaret Brennan, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  who has been working the phones to get the latest information on this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=52.88s)]
*  Margaret, tell us what is part of this agreement? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=56.24s)]
*  This is a breakthrough deal as you just described it. It's also going to be incredibly difficult to implement, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=59.92s)]
*  but what it could mean is that as soon as this weekend, as soon as Sunday, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  you could see hostages released from Gaza handed over by Hamas back to Israel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=71.44s)]
*  We will be watching to see the implementation of this. What we know is that on paper, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=79.6s)]
*  Hamas and Israel have agreed to a deal that has multiple stages. The first phase, perhaps the most important, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=84.72s)]
*  particularly to some of those American families who have been waiting to see their loved ones return. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=91.44s)]
*  This is a 42-day implementation during which 33 of those hostages, some alive, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=96.72s)]
*  some status unconfirmed, would be released in small numbers during which time we would also see [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  some redeployment of troops. We would also see aid go into Gaza, aid that is very much needed [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=111.2s)]
*  as famine-like conditions exist inside. Israel controls the entire security perimeter [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=118.48s)]
*  of that Palestinian territory, which is so embattled. What we know is that this announcement [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=123.68s)]
*  is expected to come in Doha, Qatar. That's because it is Qatar, a U.S. partner and the United States [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=130.72s)]
*  that have forced this deal to come together. The U.S. pressing the Netanyahu government, Qatar and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=138.08s)]
*  Egypt pressing Hamas to get to this deal today. It has been negotiated with the agreement of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=144.24s)]
*  the brother of Yahya Sinwar, the architect of that brutal assault on Israel that you described. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=152.08s)]
*  His brother signed off on this deal, I am told, by high-level U.S. and local sources who say this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  means it's official. Even just within the past hour, Errol, this thing could have fallen apart. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=164.48s)]
*  As you saw there, I think, pictures there of a press conference being put together where the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=172.88s)]
*  details will be released. But the bottom line here is of the hostages that were taken, seven [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=177.12s)]
*  of them still in captivity are U.S. citizens. Three of them assessed to be alive. We will [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=184.64s)]
*  have to see if this deal is fully implemented, meaning this is little by little, a few hostages, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=193.04s)]
*  movement on each side. If all the steps go through and this is fully implemented, they could see the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=199.84s)]
*  return, for example, of 64-year-old Keith Siegel, Eden Alexander, a U.S. citizen, Segi Chen. We will [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  be watching for that as well as the remains of some of the hostages that remain in Hamas captivity. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=214.08s)]
*  Errol, this is really striking because it comes in the final days of the Biden administration. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=219.52s)]
*  It was President Biden who sent his diplomatic team saying, get this done. In fact, U.S. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=224.56s)]
*  negotiator Brett McGurk has been there for the better part of a month trying to get negotiations [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=230.56s)]
*  closed. And what's so fascinating here is he had assistance from Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=236.0s)]
*  Steve Witkoff. And I am told by sources in the region and U.S. officials that they were [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=242.96s)]
*  working really as a team representing the United States, pressing Israel to agree to concessions, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=248.8s)]
*  pressing Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to agree to these concessions. In the next few days, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=256.08s)]
*  this will be critical. Back in Israel, because it is a democracy and they have a process for that, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=263.76s)]
*  the deal will still have to be agreed to by the cabinet. It will still have to go before the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=268.72s)]
*  Knesset. And one thing to watch here that could really lead to political blowback, and I know our [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=274.08s)]
*  Ramey and Asensio is in the region watching this, is the names of the Palestinian prisoners who will [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  be released. There are a number of Palestinians who are part of this deal who have been in Israeli [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=284.96s)]
*  detention facilities for some time. As their list of names is made public, we could see court cases [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=290.32s)]
*  challenging the release here. So there is a process here that could make this very difficult [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=297.92s)]
*  in just the next 48 hours, but the U.S. at this point believes they have gotten [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=304.24s)]
*  Israel and Hamas over the finish line here with the assistance of Qatar and Egypt. And for Joe [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  Biden in the final days of his administration, this is the deal that he was really wanting to see [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=316.32s)]
*  to bring to end such an incredibly bloody war that has killed over 47,000 Palestinians in Gaza, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=323.12s)]
*  that has upended the entire Middle East and also weakened one of the biggest adversaries [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=330.32s)]
*  of the United States in the Middle East, Iran. But we will be watching this carefully to see [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=337.2s)]
*  implementation follow through. But a big diplomatic win for him just to get to this point. Now we have [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=341.28s)]
*  to watch the implementation of it. Margot, Brendan laying out the headline here on a breakthrough [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=346.88s)]
*  ceasefire deal agreement between Israel and Hamas. And as you just laid out, Margot, though, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=352.8s)]
*  it is tenuous, 42 days of a ceasefire where we could see hostages released as early as this Sunday, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  but there are so many components to it. Stay close with us. We want to cross over now to CBS [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=363.92s)]
*  News foreign correspondent Remy Inosensio. He's been on the ground covering this war from both [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=368.64s)]
*  sides since the beginning. He joins us from Tel Aviv. And I know, Remy, you've been in contact [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  with many relatives of hostages and other victims. I'm curious what they've been telling you lately [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=379.52s)]
*  as we've been hearing that this deal could be imminent and what you're hearing from them today. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=385.76s)]
*  Errol, yes, that's right. In terms of the reaction that I'm getting from some families of hostages [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=392.08s)]
*  I'm texting right now is that there is relief coming from many, as you would expect. But from [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=398.64s)]
*  one complication, the older brother of the hostage, Evitar David, Elie David, who I spoke to in Jerusalem [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=404.32s)]
*  just messaged me and said, it's complicated. He says, I hate this deal because his brother and [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=412.88s)]
*  21 other men are actually not on this list of the 33. Of course, he is hoping that there's a [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=419.28s)]
*  comprehensive deal here. But this is showing the cynicism that people have been thinking about when [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=424.4s)]
*  it comes to Hamas in its dealings with Israel. The relief, no doubt, that many people are feeling here [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=432.4s)]
*  mixed with, you would imagine, emotional torture, if you will, over the past 466 days ever since the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=440.15999999999997s)]
*  events of October 7, 2023. You can also imagine that this is not just one generation. We're talking [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=449.35999999999996s)]
*  generational trauma here from hostages as young as one year old to hostages as old as 85 years old. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=455.84s)]
*  Another brother of another hostage, Michael Levy, talked about his brother Or Levy, who was abducted [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  from the Nova Music Festival. I asked him, how does he keep hope alive? He said that's the only [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  thing that he can actually hold onto. He also said, talking about the intergenerational anxiety, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=476.32s)]
*  he said that while his brother was abducted, hopefully still alive, his brother's wife [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=484.72s)]
*  was killed in the events of October 7 when a grenade was hurled into her shelter. But their [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=493.12s)]
*  three-year-old son, Almag, turned three years old without his parents. I asked Michael, Almag's uncle, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=500.08000000000004s)]
*  if he was asking less about his parents. He didn't say that they were asking less about him, but that [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=508.16s)]
*  he was actually forgetting faces, thinking that strangers were actually his parents. So this is the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=513.92s)]
*  the ebb and the flow of the emotions that have been happening here. No doubt a lot of relief, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=519.04s)]
*  but again, talking, messaging with some of the hostage families right now, as one says, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=523.5999999999999s)]
*  it's complicated because of course everyone wants to see all of their families, all of these hostages [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=528.24s)]
*  home immediately. And that's understandable. And Remy, you made a point about these these first 33. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=532.8s)]
*  We understand, according to details from earlier today, that that would include women, children, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=538.24s)]
*  older hostages. Margaret Brennan mentioned Keith Siegel among them. He's an Israeli American. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=543.44s)]
*  CBS News spoke with his wife. I spoke with his wife Aviva months ago. She's 63 now. He's 64. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=548.8000000000001s)]
*  And while she was a hostage and released a month later during the first hostage release, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=556.48s)]
*  you know, she worries about about his psychological state, which is so understandable. Can you give us [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  a quick update on the latest on the fighting? Because that, of course, has continued this entire time. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=566.88s)]
*  Yes, the fighting that has continued on in Gaza has been actually ramping up over the past few [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=574.0s)]
*  days. Our CBS News team in Gaza has been messaging us saying that they feel it might be Israel's [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=581.84s)]
*  attempt to try to destroy as much of Hamas as it has been trying to do over the past 15 months [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=589.5200000000001s)]
*  before any kind of deal has been clinched. But even in just the past [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=596.48s)]
*  hour or so, we even got reports of the killing of the deaths of a few more journalists. Tragic in [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=601.0400000000001s)]
*  that this has happened just as this deal has been reached. But when you look across the whole entire [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=607.2800000000001s)]
*  15 months, the death toll from the Hamas run health ministry is pushing 47,000 people [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=615.0400000000001s)]
*  over nearly 470 days. You can do the math there. So many people losing their lives, men, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=623.5200000000001s)]
*  women and children. We have been talking about the hostage families. And to your question, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=629.84s)]
*  it is so important to look across just miles south of where I'm standing here in Tel Aviv [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=635.2800000000001s)]
*  with the devastation, with the destruction that you are seeing on your screens right now that [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=641.44s)]
*  have been continuing in Israel's avowed promise to destroy Hamas, still very much clearly intact [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=645.76s)]
*  as we see them very apparent in negotiations that have finally, as we see, come to the ceasefire [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=654.0s)]
*  right now. Remy Anosensio giving us the latest from Tel Aviv on this breaking news. Remy, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=659.92s)]
*  thank you. And we are standing by for a press conference update of sorts out of Qatar. This [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=664.72s)]
*  Gulf nation helped mediate this deal. As soon as that happens, we'll bring you updates. Let's first [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=670.24s)]
*  cross to our CBS News national security contributor, Sam Vinograd. She served as former assistant [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=675.6s)]
*  secretary for counterterrorism at the Department of Homeland Security. Sam, we understand this [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=681.04s)]
*  agreement as significant as it is, will take place in phases. But what can you tell us about how we [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=686.56s)]
*  got here? Because it's not necessarily a slam dunk guarantee. We've almost gotten here before. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4PqnA6zJQ&t=692.48s)]
