# Israel "disregards the need to protect civilians" in war, Doctors Without Borders chief says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck)
*  Over 200 humanitarian aid workers have been killed in Gaza since October 7th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=0.0s)]
*  We're joined by the executive director of Doctors Without Borders in the U.S., Avril [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=6.16s)]
*  Benoit. She joins us from New York City. And Save the Children president, Yanti Serypto, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=10.8s)]
*  is back with us here in Washington. And I want to say condolences to both of you and your [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=15.6s)]
*  organizations for the workers that you've lost in this conflict. And I appreciate you being here [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=21.2s)]
*  with us. Yanti Serypto, you testified before the UN just this week about this ongoing problem. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=26.96s)]
*  You said more children have been killed in this conflict than have been killed in all [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=36.32s)]
*  armed conflicts globally every year over the past four years. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=41.36s)]
*  Yeah, I know, Margaret. It sounds almost unbelievable when you say it out loud. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=48.08s)]
*  It's horrific. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=53.76s)]
*  It is horrific. And people stop hearing, I think, when we hear all those numbers, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  thousands, and they forget that behind all those thousands there is a child and their families behind [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=61.2s)]
*  it. Children. And Avril Benoit, I want to go to you on this because you and the people who you [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=67.84s)]
*  work with provide help, medical aid, to those who are injured, who might be able to survive [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=77.68s)]
*  what is happening there. I want to ask you why you think we've seen this outcry this week in the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=84.48s)]
*  wake of the killing of the seven World Central Kitchen workers, including an American, but we [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  didn't hear the same after 225 aid workers were killed. Why do you think that is? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=99.04s)]
*  It certainly warrants an outcry, and it warrants an outcry every time these things happen. Not [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=110.56s)]
*  only have we seen so many civilians killed and injured, 33,000 killed, roughly 75,000 people [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=117.36000000000001s)]
*  injured, and it's proportionate to the population. So in terms of the number of children, women who [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=126.16s)]
*  are injured and killed, it's very matching. And so you ask yourself, is this a war against Hamas [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=132.24s)]
*  or a war against civilians? And among the civilians, we also have a pattern of attacks [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=138.0s)]
*  against journalists, and we see a pattern also of attacks against aid workers who are there to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  do nothing more than alleviate suffering and save lives. In our case, Doctors Without Borders has [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=151.36s)]
*  lost five colleagues, and they were in situations in some cases where they were literally at the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  bedside of patients in hospitals when they were killed. I'll be less diplomatic. Do you think [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=161.84s)]
*  that there was an outcry because these weren't Westerners? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=170.72000000000003s)]
*  No doubt the fact that World Central Kitchen, the victims of the attack, were internationals, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=174.08s)]
*  is the kind of thing that attracts more attention. It certainly finally attracted the attention of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=182.24s)]
*  President Biden, and that, of course, should concern us all, because every life should be [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=187.2s)]
*  considered of similar value, of great value, whether it's a Westerner or a American, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=192.88s)]
*  whether it's a Westerner or a Palestinian. And so you can draw conclusions. We certainly [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  are concerned about the fact that it took this attack for there to be the kind of international [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=209.68s)]
*  outcry that we've seen, although frankly, we do think it's warranted. There has been, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=215.76s)]
*  in this incident, just a sense that it was just an accident, that it was an isolated event, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=222.4s)]
*  and that is far from being the case when you actually look at the pattern of attacks on aid [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=228.56s)]
*  workers thus far. That is why I asked John Kirby about that pattern and if there was evidence of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=232.88s)]
*  what you say, that it was deliberate. Yanti, you said this week at the UN as well that this is not [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=240.24s)]
*  just about dehumanizing the victims. It dehumanizes all of us. Explain what you mean for people who [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  think this is far away and doesn't matter to them. I think the fact that these, yes, attacks on aid [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=255.76s)]
*  workers, attacks on schools, on hospitals, to Avril's point, is continually allowed to happen. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=263.36s)]
*  I mean, there are rules of war. Even in war, there are rules. There are laws against this [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=269.76s)]
*  wanton destruction of homes, of schools, of hospitals, the killing of civilians. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=276.48s)]
*  And we're just watching this unfold. And I do think that it is dehumanizing for all of us, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=282.48s)]
*  even more so for us, actually, than it is of the civilians caught up in this horrific conflict. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=288.16s)]
*  Secretary Blinken did lay out specific metrics in terms of not just trucks, but aid workers getting [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=295.44s)]
*  in. And he also said the reversal of some of the measurable impacts of famine. That takes time. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  How long does it take to reverse a famine? Well, I guess the answer back is always, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=308.08s)]
*  it depends. How much unfettered access can we get? How much supplies are we going to have allowed in? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  It is great to hear some more outrage from the president and from Secretary Blinken. And yet, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=320.32s)]
*  despite that outrage, the next day, we signed off more arms to go to Israel. So I would love to see [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=326.0s)]
*  So, you know, I would love to see some action behind those words, because we're not seeing it [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=333.52s)]
*  on the ground. We are not seeing more supplies coming in. We're now hearing noises about crossings, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=339.6s)]
*  more crossings opening, potentially better access to the north from the south. That would all be [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=346.16s)]
*  incredibly welcome. Long, long overdue, but very welcome. But we have yet to see some of that really [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=351.36s)]
*  happen on the ground and to see more details when this arrest crossing is actually opening, for whom [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=356.8s)]
*  it is opening, when the port can be ready. But actually, there are thousands of trucks with food [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=363.2s)]
*  and water and medical supplies on the border in Rafa. I saw it myself two weeks ago, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  thousands of trucks waiting. You can just let them in. That's a political decision. That's right. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=373.84s)]
*  Avril, before I let you go, your organization's asking for an investigation into the deaths of [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=380.08s)]
*  workers. Why hasn't there been a response? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=386.8s)]
*  Well, there hasn't been a response because what we have seen time and again for the last six months [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=392.48s)]
*  is that Israel is conducting this war in a way that completely disregards the need to protect [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=399.12s)]
*  civilians at all costs. I mean, there is there are norms of war, the Geneva Conventions, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=406.8s)]
*  international humanitarian law, and we see systematically that this is disrespected. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=412.32s)]
*  So we would expect an answer on that. But just on the question of the famine and acute malnutrition, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=416.08s)]
*  it's a medical condition at this point. It's a slow motion massacre of people to subject them [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=421.36s)]
*  to the kind of deprivation of food and water that they have been subjected to for the last six months. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=427.6s)]
*  It requires a medical response, massive influx, not just of food, of trucks, of flour, of lentils, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=432.56s)]
*  but of medicines and of trained personnel who know how to bring a child who is in complete organ [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=439.28s)]
*  failure back to health after suffering this kind of malnutrition. Thank you both for joining us today. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyfPYIpyck&t=445.44s)]
