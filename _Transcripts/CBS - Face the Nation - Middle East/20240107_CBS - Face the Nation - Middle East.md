# Sen. Chris Van Hollen says situation at Rafah crossing is a "24/7 humanitarian crisis"
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [January 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE)
*  Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen spent the last several days in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=0.0s)]
*  He and Senator Jeff Merkley visited the Rafa crossing between Egypt and Gaza, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=5.76s)]
*  and he joins us this morning from Amman, Jordan. Senator, what is the choke point? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=10.96s)]
*  Why isn't aid making it into Gaza? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=17.92s)]
*  Well, Margaret, Senator Merkley and I went to the Rafa crossing to find out exactly that question. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=20.24s)]
*  There are two big things that are happening. One is the unnecessarily cumbersome process going [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=32.64s)]
*  through the Israeli screening process, which I believe is the result of political decisions [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=40.44s)]
*  by the Netanyahu coalition. For example, many items that should be allowed to go into Gaza, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=47.36s)]
*  water sort of filtration systems, other systems like that, were in a warehouse of rejected items [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=56.4s)]
*  that we visited. While we were there, we saw a truck turned away that had a big box from UNICEF, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  which is of course the UN organization that helps children. It was a unit to help with water [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=72.88s)]
*  desalinization. It was rejected. And when one item on a truck is rejected, the entire truck [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=79.44s)]
*  is rejected. The other big issue is within Gaza, the so-called deconfliction process, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=87.36s)]
*  which is just a fancy name for those who are providing humanitarian assistance to have the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=93.52s)]
*  confidence that they can deliver it without being killed. And according to all the international [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=98.56s)]
*  NGOs that we talked about who've been operating in conflict zones around the world, they've never [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=105.2s)]
*  seen a worse process for assuring the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance. And so that, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=111.04s)]
*  of course, makes it very difficult to get the help to people who need it, people who are [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=119.2s)]
*  starving and where they're on the verge of outbreak of cholera and other diseases. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=125.2s)]
*  France and Jordan made the decision to airdrop aid in because of those issues going in by land. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=131.12s)]
*  Should the United States do the same? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=139.04s)]
*  Well, I think we should consider every means to try to get desperately needed humanitarian assistance [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=146.96s)]
*  in to Gaza. The problem with airdrops is it's just not at scale. In other words, it's good. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=152.48s)]
*  But what we need is far more trucks to be able to cross into Gaza. After all, before the war [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=159.2s)]
*  started, you had 500 trucks crossing into Gaza. And today, this last week, it was around 150 [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  trucks per day. We need to make this a 24-7 operation. The Israeli screening sites [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=177.28s)]
*  are only operating on like an eight-hour-a-day schedule, taking some days off. This is a 24-7 [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=186.0s)]
*  humanitarian crisis. And we need a system that will recognize that people are dying every day. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=193.84s)]
*  Of course, some from bombs. We have over 22 people dead, two-thirds of them women and children, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=203.2s)]
*  but also this humanitarian crisis. You said you believe aid's not getting in because of a political [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  decision by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. If that's the case, does that government [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  need to face consequences from the United States, their ally? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=223.67999999999998s)]
*  Yes, I do think there have been, have to be consequences. And Secretary Blinken and President [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  Biden have been right to insist on two things, a reduction in the unacceptable levels of civilian [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  casualties and much more cooperation when it comes to providing humanitarian assistance. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=248.0s)]
*  We've not seen that. This is one reason why I and other senators have proposed an amendment [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  that would apply to every country that the United States provides military assistance to, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=260.8s)]
*  whether it's Ukraine, Israel, or any other country, that would require that country to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  cooperate fully with the United States in providing humanitarian assistance in an area of conflict [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=270.16s)]
*  where U.S.-provided weapons are being used. It would also require all recipients of U.S. military [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  assistance to abide by international humanitarian law. These are some basic principles that should [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=283.6s)]
*  be universally applied by the United States. The White House so far has not signed on to that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=289.84s)]
*  Before I let you go, sir, I want to ask you, since you're coming back to Washington to work, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  63% of Americans, according to our polling, believe Joe Biden needs to get tougher at the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=303.76s)]
*  U.S. border. I'm wondering if you are comfortable with provisions that would tighten asylum law [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  and give more expulsion authority to turn away migrants coming to the United States? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=315.6s)]
*  Well, Margaret, President Biden is well aware of the unacceptable challenges that we're facing [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=326.88s)]
*  right now at the U.S. border, which is why he provided a large number of additional proposed [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=332.32000000000005s)]
*  additional resources for border patrol agents. As you know, there's a bipartisan group of senators [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  discussing various policy changes. I'm looking forward to hearing the results of those discussions. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=346.0s)]
*  I'm told that both the Democratic Senate caucus and the Republican Senate caucus may be briefed [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=353.52s)]
*  as early as this week on a framework, although I don't know for sure. I'm going to have to look [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=358.79999999999995s)]
*  at every proposal before I make any final decision. I can tell you that some of the House proposals [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=364.56s)]
*  are way too extreme. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyMVz9mEhE&t=370.47999999999996s)]
