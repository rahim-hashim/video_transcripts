# Iran, Hezbollah's retaliatory attack on Israel could come with little to no warning
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [August 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA)
*  Israel, the United States, and other allies are on high alert for possible retaliation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=0.0s)]
*  by Iran and Hezbollah after a pair of high-profile assassinations. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  CBS News has learned attacks on Israel could be launched with little to no warning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=9.8s)]
*  Yesterday, President Biden, alongside leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, issued [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=13.96s)]
*  a joint statement calling on Iran to stand down on its threats against Israel. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=18.78s)]
*  It also said they discussed the, quote, serious consequences for security if Iran does attack. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=24.6s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Innocencio is in Tel Aviv, Israel, covering this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  Remy, first, let's back up a little bit because there are often so many, forgive the wording, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  tit for tats here. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  How did we get to this point and what is Iran saying about potential retaliation? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=41.78s)]
*  Lindsey, hi there. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=46.52s)]
*  Yeah, well, the most proximate reason for where we are right now are the twin high-profile [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  assassinations that happened two weeks ago. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=54.76s)]
*  The first assassination happened in Lebanon and it was the death of Hezbollah leader, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=57.8s)]
*  Fouad Shouker, at the hands of Israel. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=64.0s)]
*  The Israel military did acknowledge that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=66.0s)]
*  The other one happened a day later on July 31st. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=68.68s)]
*  That was even more high-profile. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=72.0s)]
*  Hamas's chief of its political wing, Ismail Haniyeh. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=74.08s)]
*  And Israel has not acknowledged that assassination, but Iran does lay the blame on Israel's military. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=78.52s)]
*  And Israel's military, for its part, has not commented. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  In terms of what Iran is saying, in terms of any retaliation, they say that Israel has [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=88.36s)]
*  brought it upon themselves. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  They labeled Israel as the aggressor and they say that because of Israel's actions, they [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=94.28s)]
*  have the right to retaliate. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=98.64s)]
*  But as you say, if we want to walk this further back, past two weeks ago, there were a number [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=100.24s)]
*  of tit-for-tat retaliations, strikes back and forth. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=105.68s)]
*  We could keep on going far back into the distant past. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=110.2s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=112.68s)]
*  So what is the United States positioning if Iran retaliates? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=113.68s)]
*  Could we see increased involvement? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=116.92s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=120.04s)]
*  Well, the positioning militarily is there. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=121.84s)]
*  We have been seeing that over the past week, week and a half or so. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=125.6s)]
*  Right now, we know that the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group has been ordered [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=129.23999999999998s)]
*  to speed up its sailing from the Western Pacific. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=136.64s)]
*  The last known position was about 19, 20 days ago off the coast of Western Hawaii. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=139.32s)]
*  And it is sailing towards the Mideast. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=144.28s)]
*  It is equipped with F-35 fighters. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=146.0s)]
*  In addition, the Pentagon has also publicly acknowledged the presence and the deployment [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=148.76s)]
*  of the USS Georgia. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=154.16s)]
*  This is a submarine that has cruise missiles, Tomahawk missiles that are often mostly used [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  for offense. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  In addition, that will be supplementing what is already here in the Mideast, the F-18, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  additional F-18 fighters that arrived last Monday and then F-22 fighters that arrived [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  on Thursday. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  All of this to say is that the force posture of the United States is increasing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=173.44s)]
*  And what would it do if Iran did decide to do those retaliatory strikes? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=176.76s)]
*  They would do potentially the same thing that they did exactly four months ago this evening, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=181.04s)]
*  which is to target drones and missiles that were coming from Israel. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=185.28s)]
*  And we know that four months ago, the United States helped down about 80 drones and about [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=190.48s)]
*  six cruise or ballistic missiles. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=196.48s)]
*  You had mentioned the twin assassinations, Remy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=198.88s)]
*  One was a part of the ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=201.76s)]
*  Where do those talks stand right now? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=206.52s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=208.52s)]
*  Well, we're two days away from at least the date of those talks. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=209.52s)]
*  So we understand those will be held in Qatar. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=214.2s)]
*  And right now, they are still set to go ahead. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  Where it stands is that Israel has said that they will attend. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=221.48s)]
*  However, Hamas, just in the past 36, 48 hours, has said that in a statement, they said that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=225.92s)]
*  they wanted to go back to a proposal that they had agreed to from early July. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=231.39999999999998s)]
*  They didn't say that they wouldn't not attend the ceasefire talks this Thursday, but they're [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  saying that they want to go go back to that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=243.28s)]
*  In addition, we also know that the U.S. is sending the president's envoy to the Middle [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=245.56s)]
*  East, Brett McGurk, and there is talk and expectation that at some point Secretary of [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=251.32000000000002s)]
*  State Antony Blinken will attend. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  There had also been talk, by the way, that Iran might send a delegation, but just in [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=257.68s)]
*  the past hour or so, the Iranian delegation at the United Nations said that they have [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=261.12s)]
*  not been part of the indirect talks and they don't plan on sending any delegation to those [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=265.76s)]
*  talks. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  OK, Remy, appreciate that last update. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=270.96000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqfs965Q4VA&t=272.8s)]
