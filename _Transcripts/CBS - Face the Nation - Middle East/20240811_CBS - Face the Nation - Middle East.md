Video Description: Retired Gen. Frank McKenzie, the former commander of U.S. Central Command, predicted on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" Sunday that Lebanese Hezbollah could soon be involved in the border conflict with Israel. "I think we are hours, maybe days — not weeks — away from Lebanese Hezbollah entering this fight." "The are the largest non-state military entity in the world," McKenzie told Brennan. Tensions have been rising in the Middle East, where fears of an expanding regional war have been growing a week after Israel killed a top Hamas leader in Iran and two Hezbollah commanders.

# Retired Gen. Frank McKenzie believes Lebanese Hezbollah close to entering Middle East conflict
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [August 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA)
*  Tensions are high in the Middle East where fears of an expanding regional war are growing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=0.0s)]
*  A week after, Israel killed the top Hamas leader in Iran and two Hezbollah commanders. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=5.4s)]
*  For more, we go to retired General Frank McKenzie, who was the former commander of U.S. forces [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=10.96s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=16.3s)]
*  Good to have you back. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=17.3s)]
*  Good to be here, Margaret. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=18.3s)]
*  General, we've talked a number of times in recent months, and the scenario you have flagged [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=20.96s)]
*  is the most concerning is one it seems we are on the brink of, and that is Lebanese [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=25.56s)]
*  Hezbollah entering this conflict potentially in a significant way. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=30.82s)]
*  How do you characterize where we are right now? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=36.46s)]
*  Margaret, I think we are hours, maybe days, not weeks away from Lebanese Hezbollah entering [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=40.0s)]
*  this fight, and that's always been the big variable. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  They are the largest non-state military entity in the world, you know, a parasite on Lebanon, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=49.2s)]
*  they have tens and tens of thousands of highly accurate rockets and missiles, and they can [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=54.839999999999996s)]
*  challenge Israel in a way that Iran and the Houthis, for that matter, are unable to do [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=59.339999999999996s)]
*  so because of their geographic proximity, because of the number of weapons that they [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=63.92s)]
*  have, and that's very concerning. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=68.32s)]
*  I've thought all along the most dangerous turn in events would be if they chose to enter [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=70.96s)]
*  at scale. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  Now, Hassan Nasrullah, the leader of Lebanese Hezbollah, has got to make a very strategic [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  decision on this because he will be open to a withering Israeli counterattack should he [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=81.76s)]
*  choose to enter at great scale, and what would great scale be? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=86.64s)]
*  Don't know. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=90.48s)]
*  I would say if he chooses to attack Israeli population centers, I would say if significant [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=91.48s)]
*  casualties are caused by a Hezbollah attack, that will bring the IDF back in with great [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=97.36s)]
*  force, and he recognizes that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=102.84s)]
*  The last point I'd just make is Hassan Nasrullah and Lebanese Hezbollah are perhaps weaker [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=105.4s)]
*  in Lebanon now than they've been in many years because of the destruction of the economy, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=109.84s)]
*  the countries and the governmental gridlock, lots of problems in Lebanon that he has to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  think about before he chooses to fight Israel toe to toe. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=120.48s)]
*  And that certainly is something the diplomats who are trying to cool things off are very [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=124.2s)]
*  aware of. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=128.68s)]
*  Your successor, CENTCOM commander General Karila, was twice in Israel this past week. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=129.88s)]
*  We know the United States has sent F-22 jets to the region. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=135.52s)]
*  What do you expect the scope of U.S. involvement to be? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  I think we saw a taste of that last April, Iran's 13 April attack on Israel, which was [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=145.12s)]
*  not a successful attack, and it was not successful for several reasons, one of which was Israeli [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  competence. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=156.0s)]
*  The second was U.S. assistance and some assistance from other nations in the region. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=157.0s)]
*  All of those things militated to blunt and really turn aside the Iranian attack. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  I think that General Karila will probably strive to reproduce those same capabilities, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=167.27999999999997s)]
*  that same approach this time. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=172.0s)]
*  It will be a significantly harder task, though, again, if Lebanese Hezbollah chooses to enter, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  because now you face a multi-axis attack. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  Iran from the east, Lebanese Hezbollah from the north. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=182.64s)]
*  I'm sure Hamas will chime in to the limits of their ability, and the Houthis will come [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  in. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=189.32s)]
*  It will be a significant test for Israel. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=190.32s)]
*  We are committed to their defense. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  I think that Central Command has done a great job of assisting them as they prepare for [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=194.76s)]
*  this attack, which I believe is imminent. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=198.48s)]
*  Is imminent. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=201.4s)]
*  You would expect to see U.S. jets in the air there, intercepting as they did last time. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=202.4s)]
*  I think we would see the same model that was used last time. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=209.04s)]
*  Now here's the thing. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  The Iranians and Lebanese Hezbollah have had the opportunity to study that template. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=213.2s)]
*  I'm sure they'll try to make some adjustments that will make it more difficult. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=216.96s)]
*  On the other hand, we too are an adaptive learning organization, so we'll be looking [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=220.44s)]
*  at our tactics. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  We've got very good commanders who can fight an air battle, and it will be an air battle [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  that's going to be fought. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=228.88s)]
*  I think we can be very successful here. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  Do you think the U.S. strategy of trying to focus in on August 15th and a ceasefire in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=233.46s)]
*  Gaza should still be the centerpiece for lowering tensions throughout the region? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  We should try to get to some post-conflict state in Gaza. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=246.56s)]
*  That's an objective that needs to be there regardless of whatever else is going on in [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=249.96s)]
*  the region. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=253.52s)]
*  I'm not certain, though, that the current Iranian efforts against Israel are directly [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=254.52s)]
*  related to what's going on in Gaza. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=259.08s)]
*  The Iranians' fundamental to Iranian philosophy of life is destruction of the state of Israel. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=261.92s)]
*  We should take them at their word on this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=266.0s)]
*  They're not actually going to attack or come into conflict with Israel because of what's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=268.12s)]
*  going on in Gaza. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  Their reasons are the existence of Israel itself, and those transcend anything going [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=274.22s)]
*  on in Gaza. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=278.3s)]
*  Sir, before I let you go, August 15th is the anniversary of the Taliban's cease and control [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=279.3s)]
*  of Afghanistan a few years ago. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=285.94000000000005s)]
*  I wonder what you think about U.S. security currently. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=288.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think about it a lot, Margaret. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=292.90000000000003s)]
*  Three years on, our ability to see inside Afghanistan is quite limited. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=297.70000000000005s)]
*  The violent extremist organizations characterized by ISIS-K and other groups, we believe they're [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=302.18s)]
*  actually expanding. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=308.54s)]
*  They carried out a successful attack in Russia a few months ago. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=309.66s)]
*  I am concerned about the growth of those organizations, and I'm concerned about the relative lack [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=312.74s)]
*  of our ability to see what they're doing and act against them should it prove necessary [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=317.1s)]
*  to do so. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=321.22s)]
*  So I think we're in a weaker state now than we were a year ago or two years ago, and I [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=322.22s)]
*  am concerned about the future. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=325.86s)]
*  General, always good to talk to you, and we'll all be on edge, as you said, for the coming [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=328.7s)]
*  days. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=335.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ladfSXEqA&t=336.26s)]
