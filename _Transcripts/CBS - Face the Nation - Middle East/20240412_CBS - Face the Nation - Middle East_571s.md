# Everything we know about a possible Iranian attack on Israel
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc)
*  But first, U.S. officials say Iran is on the brink of launching an attack on Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=0.0s)]
*  A direct attack on Israeli soil would be a major escalation in an already tense region. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=5.12s)]
*  Israel's war with Iranian-backed Hamas has lasted more than six months. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=10.88s)]
*  Iran had promised to retaliate for a strike nearly two weeks ago that killed multiple [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=15.44s)]
*  Iranian military officers in Syria. Iran blames Israel for that strike. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=20.0s)]
*  The U.S. is watching closely, and President Biden has issued a warning. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=25.2s)]
*  Here's CBS News' senior White House correspondent, Weetia Shah. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=29.12s)]
*  A U.S. official tells CBS News that the size of the planned attack aimed at military targets [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=33.44s)]
*  in Israel has grown in recent days. It could include more than 100 drones, 150 cruise missiles, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=39.6s)]
*  and even ballistic missiles used for long-range strikes. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=47.52s)]
*  Tonight, a warning from President Biden to Tehran. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=51.6s)]
*  Mr. President, what is your message to Iran in this moment? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=55.92s)]
*  Don't. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=58.96s)]
*  Iran has vowed to retaliate, blaming Israel for an airstrike that demolished its consulate [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=60.48s)]
*  in the Syrian capital of Damascus. Iranian state media claims 13, including two senior [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=66.56s)]
*  Iranian generals, were killed. A spokesperson for the IDF says Israel is not only on the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=73.44s)]
*  defensive, but we are also prepared to go on the offensive. We are prepared to strike with a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=80.0s)]
*  variety of capabilities, he said. Today, the Pentagon's top commander for the Middle East [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=87.68s)]
*  arrived in Israel as preparations continue, and Biden once again pledged the U.S.'s ironclad [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  support. We are devoted to the defense of Israel. We will support Israel. We will defend, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=101.12s)]
*  help defend Israel, and Iran will not succeed. The State Department is warning American diplomats [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=107.44000000000001s)]
*  not to travel outside Tel Aviv or Jerusalem, while the U.K. has gone further, advising people [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=114.08s)]
*  to leave Israel if they can. General Frank McKenzie, the former head of Central Command, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=120.8s)]
*  said an Iranian attack could lead to a broader conflict in the region. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=126.96s)]
*  If there's a significant mass casualty event inside Israel, then I think the possibility [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=131.68s)]
*  of escalation is very, very high. And Weijia joins me now. So tell us, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=136.24s)]
*  what is the Biden administration prepared to do if Iran follows through with this strike? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=141.92s)]
*  Well, Lana, that really depends on what an attack results in, right? I mean, it is one thing to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  continue to support Israel, to give it all of the aid it needs to defend itself and to respond to it [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  if it is only Israel that is impacted. But there are also U.S. facilities and personnel in the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  region, and it would be a very different conversation if there were any U.S. casualties [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=167.92s)]
*  and certainly fatalities. What we do know, our colleague Margaret Brennan reported that, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=173.44s)]
*  according to sources, Iran has been funneling weapons to countries surrounding in the area. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=180.0s)]
*  And so there is new concern about what that means, because they're funneling these weapons and assets [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=189.6s)]
*  to other groups, to their proxy groups. So there are big questions about what that could mean for [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=196.24s)]
*  U.S. personnel as well as facilities in the area, Lana. And Weijia, we all know that Iran has several [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=202.56s)]
*  proxy groups in the region. Could we see those groups play a role in this expected attack? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, that is one big outstanding question, because we don't know exactly how this [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=216.24s)]
*  attack will be carried out. But certainly, as we have seen before, they have stepped in. They've [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=220.4s)]
*  been proxies for Iran in other aggressions, especially with regard to the Red Sea that we [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=225.44s)]
*  saw earlier this year. And so nobody really knows exactly how this is going to play out. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=232.72s)]
*  But we can tell you tonight that the Pentagon has sent additional U.S. resources, including [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=240.88s)]
*  repositioning a Navy ship to join another warship that is already in the region, along with other [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=247.04s)]
*  assets to beef up deterrence and to protect the U.S. forces that are there. Lana. Weijia, thank you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=253.28s)]
*  Israel is already facing attacks near its border with Lebanon. Our Deborah Pata is in Tel Aviv. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=262.48s)]
*  The Iranian back group has vilified a barrage of missiles from Lebanon into northern Israel earlier. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=269.04s)]
*  This is what the night sky looked like a short while ago. The Israeli Defense Force says most [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=274.96s)]
*  of the missiles were intercepted, the rest falling on empty land with no injuries. Israel remains on [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=280.0s)]
*  high alert, bracing itself for the possibility of an attack by Iran in retaliation for the bombing [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=286.88s)]
*  of its consulate in Damascus. A former Mossad official, Seema Shine, told us that there's a [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=293.6s)]
*  real fear that the region could be on the brink of an expanded conflict. She believes the attack [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=299.52s)]
*  could either come from a number of Iranian proxies in Lebanon, Iraq, or Yemen, or directly from Iran. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=305.92s)]
*  And if it resulted in mass casualties, this would have the potential for significant escalation. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=314.24s)]
*  Lana. All right, Deborah, thank you. For more CBS News Face the Nation moderator and Chief Foreign [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  Affairs correspondent, Margaret Brennan joins me now. Margaret, President Biden has said that he [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=328.16s)]
*  expects military action sooner rather than later, and CBS News has learned that Iran is planning to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=332.72s)]
*  attack Israel with a barrage of rockets and drones. I'm wondering what you can tell us is the latest [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  that you're hearing. Well, Lana, we know from our Pentagon reporters that there are more [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=342.8s)]
*  U.S. military assets also being shifted into the region, ships redirected. That's just showing that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  forces are on standby for what may come next. We also know that the Biden administration is [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  providing warnings and planning to Americans who are in Israel, to U.S. personnel there [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=362.48s)]
*  as well and in the surrounding area of any kind of risk of escalation from this latest strike that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=369.6s)]
*  is expected, a strike that Iran says it has to carry out because its top generals were killed by [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  Israel on April the 1st in a strike Israel conducted without giving the United States a heads up. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=384.56s)]
*  And that frustrated the Biden administration because they weren't able to protect U.S. forces [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=390.64s)]
*  and personnel in the region in advance of it. They're basically trying to do that right now. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=395.84s)]
*  And so we will be watching really, I think, hour by hour what happens next. And Israel's response [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=401.35999999999996s)]
*  will be determined most likely by how successful Iran is at evading their defenses and potentially [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  causing fatalities. And Margaret, as you're talking about the potential for escalation, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=413.84s)]
*  I'm hoping you can walk us through the potential implications. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=418.48s)]
*  Well, since October 7th and the beginning of this war in Israel, the concern has been what could be [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=422.64000000000004s)]
*  the event that would spiral this into a regional conflict. And to date, Iran and the United States [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=429.12s)]
*  have been sending messages to each other saying, we—neither of us want to escalate this. And [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  this series of events, with Israel carrying out that strike inside Syria that killed Iranian [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=442.72s)]
*  generals, really was an escalation. And that makes us a state-on-state potential conflict, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=449.04s)]
*  not just Iran's proxy forces, not just the militias it funds and provides weapons to. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=458.08000000000004s)]
*  And it is that definition that is really causing great concern here. What we know is that all the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=463.36s)]
*  diplomatic work behind the scenes—this is not just the U.S. sending written messages to Iran. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=470.32s)]
*  This is a full-court press. Germany, the United Kingdom, Oman, Qatar, every country in the region [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=475.92s)]
*  is really trying to say, let's not broaden this, because if it does, things can spiral. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  As you know, this is going to have implications potentially for the U.S. forces, 2,500 in Iraq, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=487.6s)]
*  900 in Syria, military presence in Jordan. We have diplomats throughout the region. We have U.S. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=493.84s)]
*  citizens throughout the region. And we also know that global financial markets react. You saw, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=499.12s)]
*  by the end of the day, oil prices up 1 percent. There is a spillover effect when there is global [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=505.04s)]
*  conflict. And right now, we have it on so many fronts. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=511.76s)]
*  And given how high these stakes are, Margaret, is there any chance that Iran might pull back? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=514.0s)]
*  This has been the hope, Lana, because the messages last week the United States and Iran [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=520.24s)]
*  passed back and forth. Iran was clear that it wasn't seeking conflict with the United States. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=525.2s)]
*  The United States was clear, don't hit U.S. personnel and facilities. They're trying to [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=530.0s)]
*  establish guardrails. And since October 7th, Iran has been fairly restrained in a way that surprised [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=534.24s)]
*  a lot of diplomats. And so they are seeing some of these things potentially and hoping [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=543.6800000000001s)]
*  that Iran just carries out a face-saving move, that they have to do something but not something [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  significant enough that it causes a tit-for-tat that goes back and forth between Israel and Iran. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=555.9200000000001s)]
*  Margaret Brennan, always appreciate you providing all of that important context so that we can [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=562.88s)]
*  better understand this. Thank you. Thanks, Lana. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAolCVePrHc&t=567.52s)]
