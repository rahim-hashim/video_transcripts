# U.S. to send Israel a missile defense system, troops to operate it
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk)
*  To the Middle East now, where the US is now funneling resources and troops to help protect Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=0.0s)]
*  The US says it will send a missile defense system to Israel, along with nearly 100 US troops to operate it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=5.5s)]
*  That announcement came as Hezbollah launched a deadly drone attack on an Israeli base. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=13.0s)]
*  That attack killed four Israeli soldiers and wounded more than 60 others. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=18.0s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Ramia Inosincio joins us now from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=22.5s)]
*  Ramie, what prompted the US to send its troops and air defense system to Israel? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=27.0s)]
*  Liz, hi there. Right. Major move. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=33.0s)]
*  The Pentagon said that this new deployment is part of broader adjustments to keep supporting Israel [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=35.0s)]
*  and to keep protecting Americans who live here from attacks from Iran and militias across this region [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=40.0s)]
*  that are also aligned with that country. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=46.0s)]
*  And this green light came straight from President Biden. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=47.5s)]
*  And we're talking about the FAD defense system. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=50.0s)]
*  And that stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, which can specifically shoot down ballistic missiles. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=52.5s)]
*  A US official confirmed that, that around 100 US troops are being deployed here to help operate it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=58.5s)]
*  And, you know, through the context of what's happening, this is happening as we wait for Israel to potentially retaliate against Iran. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=63.5s)]
*  That's after Iran retaliated against Israel two weeks ago. That was on October 1st. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=69.5s)]
*  And that was with about 180 ballistic missiles. Liz. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=74.5s)]
*  And Ramie Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for the drone attack on an Israeli base. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=77.5s)]
*  It's now considered the deadliest strike by Hezbollah since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon nearly two weeks ago. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=82.5s)]
*  What do we know so far about that attack and how Israel might respond to it? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=89.5s)]
*  Liz, yeah, you're right. And not just in the past few weeks was it the most lethal attack. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=94.5s)]
*  It's one of the most lethal strikes to hit Israel since Hamas even invaded on October 7th of last year. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=97.5s)]
*  And what Israel is trying to learn right now is how that drone got through the country's advanced air defenses. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=104.5s)]
*  We know those defenses are precise. We know they're high tech and we know that they're some of the best maybe even in the world, we could say. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=110.5s)]
*  Some local media reported that that drone was flying low to the ground, which may have helped it evade surveillance. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=115.5s)]
*  It was then able to fly south by at least 60 to 65 miles from the Lebanese border and those Hezbollah positions. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=121.5s)]
*  Target that air base, target the Galani air base, which we understand trains up raw recruits into the military and then smash through the roof of that dining hall as we saw in pictures killing and wounding all of those soldiers. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=128.5s)]
*  That attack also shows that Hezbollah can very much strike deeper into Israel beyond the border area. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=139.5s)]
*  The militant group earlier said that it was in retaliation for two Israeli strikes in Beirut. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=145.5s)]
*  That was last Thursday. They killed more than 20 people. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=150.5s)]
*  And it would not be misplaced to say that we're just seeing the start of even more violence, more aggression and more warfare in between the two countries. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vLVdF0sEk&t=153.5s)]
