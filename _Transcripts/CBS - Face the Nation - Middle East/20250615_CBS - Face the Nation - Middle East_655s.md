# Sen. Tom Cotton says Trump has "made clear" that the U.S. backs "Israel to the hilt"
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ)
*  We're joined now in Washington by Senator Tom Cotton, who is the chairman of the Intelligence [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=4.48s)]
*  Good morning and happy Father's Day to you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=5.48s)]
*  Thank you, Margaret. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=7.2s)]
*  So I know you are staying on top of all these events. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=8.76s)]
*  When it comes to what President Trump has said publicly, he seems to be indicating not [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=12.32s)]
*  just that the U.S. had nothing to do with the attack on Iran, but he's saying this is [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=17.14s)]
*  not America's fight unless Iran hits the U.S. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=21.62s)]
*  Should it be such a bright line? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  Well, what the president said in his overnight post was a clear message to the Ayatollahs, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=27.56s)]
*  that if you hit America in any way, whether our troops or our citizens or our ships, for [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=32.28s)]
*  instance, then you're going to feel the full force and strength of the U.S. military in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=37.0s)]
*  a way no one's ever seen. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=41.0s)]
*  That's a clear deterrent message, setting aside the threat that the nuclear program [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=43.32s)]
*  poses to Israel and to the United States, because let's remember, the Iranian regime has been [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=46.84s)]
*  terrorizing Americans. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=52.04s)]
*  It's killed thousands of Americans. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=53.44s)]
*  It's taken them hostage. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=55.04s)]
*  It still chants death to America, and it's building missiles that can strike not just [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=56.6s)]
*  our troops or our friends in the region, but soon enough here in the United States as well. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  That's why President Trump has been consistent for his 10 years in political life, that we [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=64.36s)]
*  cannot allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=68.72s)]
*  We cannot allow them to have a path to a nuclear weapon with uranium enrichment. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=71.16s)]
*  That's the deal that he was trying to negotiate for the last two months, but as he said early [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=75.08s)]
*  last week, Iran was simply too stubborn. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=79.04s)]
*  They weren't willing to come to the table and negotiate. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=81.7s)]
*  I have to disagree with the reporter who said that Israel strikes in Iran ended those negotiations. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=84.68s)]
*  It was Iran's stubbornness that ended them. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  President Trump was clear about that, and he is still clear that there is time, if they [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=93.0s)]
*  want to come back to negotiate an end to the uranium enrichment program, that he would [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=96.0s)]
*  accept that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  But he's given them chance after chance, as he said. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  In terms of the line he's drawing on military force, should the U.S. involvement be purely [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  defensive and deterrent, or should the U.S. be willing to be engaged in these military [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  operations? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=113.56s)]
*  I don't think he's drawn that line. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=114.64s)]
*  He's been very clear that all options remain on the table to defend our own people, to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  support Israel. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=120.52s)]
*  He hasn't said that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=121.52s)]
*  Well, he said that for 10 years, and he said it for months leading up to this moment. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=122.52s)]
*  He said that Iran can make a deal and live happily without death, or there will be bombing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=126.8s)]
*  So I think he's appropriately kept all options on the table. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  He made clear in the early days of this conflict, on Thursday night and Friday morning, that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=136.16s)]
*  we back Israel to the hilt. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=140.88s)]
*  There's almost 700,000 Americans in Israel at any time, so of course we're going to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=142.96s)]
*  protect Israel, and that we have the best military technology in the world. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  He said that he has proudly provided Israel with those weapons, both in his first term [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=149.8s)]
*  and in this term as well. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=154.88s)]
*  So we back Israel to the hilt all the way, but he's appropriately keeping all options [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=156.36s)]
*  on the table. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=160.08s)]
*  But he's emphasizing again and again, this isn't us, this isn't America, this isn't [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=161.08s)]
*  an American operation. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  So far in this operation, we have not been involved in offensive strikes. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=165.42000000000002s)]
*  We've been involved in other ways, through our provision of Israel with weapons over [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  the years, or our defense of Israel and its citizens and our citizens in Israel. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=172.52s)]
*  Now he has said his objective remains the same, which is Iran's nuclear disarmament. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  And he has said that that can happen still through a deal. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=182.44s)]
*  He prefers diplomacy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=184.72s)]
*  And he would like Iran to come back to the table, I think now that Iran sees that Israel [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=186.56s)]
*  and America means business, and surrender its enrichment capabilities voluntarily. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=192.24s)]
*  If that doesn't happen though, I think these strikes are going to continue. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=198.78s)]
*  But to the point, if it's really about destroying the nuclear program that Iran has, you know [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=201.88000000000002s)]
*  this very well, that there's this underground facility at Fordow, very deep, under a mountain. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=207.36s)]
*  It's long been assessed that only the US has the capability with a bunker buster bomb to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  take it out. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=217.52s)]
*  Should the United States offer that kind of massive ordinance penetrator to Israel to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  finish the job? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=224.08s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to speculate about the methods that the United States or Israel might [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=225.08s)]
*  use to protect our own interests. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=229.28s)]
*  I'll simply say this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=231.48s)]
*  It is, as you say, widely known that Israel does not have heavy bombers. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=233.28s)]
*  It doesn't have those 30,000 pound penetrating munitions. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=237.39999999999998s)]
*  But as we saw with Hezbollah last fall, as we saw in Iran on Thursday night when the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=241.6s)]
*  Mossad had infiltrated officers and agents and manufactured drones in Iran, Israel has [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=247.6s)]
*  more than a few tricks up their sleeve. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=253.76s)]
*  And I wouldn't be surprised if Israel has other cards yet to play. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=255.88s)]
*  So when it comes to differences in intelligence assessments, the US intelligence that was [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  made public in March said at the time, the US does not assess Iran's building a nuclear [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=265.3s)]
*  weapon and that the Supreme Leader has not reauthorized the nuclear weapons program that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  he suspended back in 2003. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  Was there more recent US intel sharing or intel indicating that there was some kind [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=278.52s)]
*  of sprint for a bomb? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=283.24s)]
*  Because that seems a very different assessment from what Israel's claiming. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=285.0s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, Iran enriched a lot of uranium to near weapons grade over the four [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=288.8s)]
*  years of the Biden administration. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  But that's not weaponization. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=295.2s)]
*  They are close to having enough pure weapons grade uranium for several weapons. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=296.94s)]
*  Now that's not the only step to having a weapon. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=304.44s)]
*  You also have to have the weapon design. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=306.8s)]
*  We've seen indications that Iran is once again exploring those weapon designs. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=308.91999999999996s)]
*  And then if you want to use a missile, obviously you have to marry up the warhead to the missile. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=313.52s)]
*  But Iran has other delivery methods as well through terrorist proxies. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=317.16s)]
*  So I think that's one of the reasons why both President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=320.56s)]
*  thought we're things that were coming to a head. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=324.52000000000004s)]
*  A second reason is Iran is rapidly producing ballistic missiles, both medium range to target [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=326.6s)]
*  Israel and short range to target our troops. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=332.76000000000005s)]
*  And they add substantially to those stockpiles every single month. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=334.92s)]
*  And at a time when Iran is both continuing its work on its nuclear program and trying [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=339.36s)]
*  to rebuild its offensive missile capacity, that the window to actually stop Iran from [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=346.32s)]
*  entering that zone of immunity was rapidly closing. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=352.36s)]
*  But why Thursday night? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=356.12s)]
*  There seems to be a difference in the idea of a sprint. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=357.12s)]
*  Well as President Trump said on Friday morning that he had given Iran 60 days to make a deal. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=361.88s)]
*  And that was day 61. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=366.2s)]
*  And he scheduled talks on day 63. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=367.2s)]
*  You know that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=368.88s)]
*  I mean this wasn't really a hard deadline. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=369.88s)]
*  He gave them 60 days on day 61. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=372.8s)]
*  The strikes began. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=374.68s)]
*  On day 63, Steve Wittkopf wanted to meet with him. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=376.52s)]
*  But if this was a covert race to weaponize though, it raises questions here because it [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=378.96s)]
*  appears President Trump's offer is to negotiate with the existing regime that is in place [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=385.0s)]
*  in Iran. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=390.76s)]
*  Do you support a deal with the existing regime in Iran to stay in place? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=391.92s)]
*  Do you support his push for diplomacy? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=398.44s)]
*  President Trump has always said his goal is to end Iran's nuclear weapons program, which [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=400.76s)]
*  means the surrender of its uranium enrichment capability. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=406.04s)]
*  But this would be offering them a lifeline, wouldn't it? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=408.56s)]
*  Well it would be protecting our interests and securing Israel's interests as well and [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  Iran not having a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=415.84s)]
*  We've seen what happens when they don't have nuclear weapons. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=417.32s)]
*  They're deliberately targeting civilian areas in Israel. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  We've seen their campaign a tear against Americans over the decades. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=423.8s)]
*  That's why we can't allow them to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=427.56s)]
*  For 20 years, presidents have said that. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=430.68s)]
*  George Bush said it, didn't act on it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=432.64s)]
*  Barack Obama and Joe Biden frankly aided and abetted Iran's nuclear program. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=434.88s)]
*  Only Donald Trump has drawn that line and is willing to enforce that line. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=439.12s)]
*  But he's not enforcing that line. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=442.24s)]
*  It is Israel that's bombing. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=444.04s)]
*  As you just said, the United States is not involved in these offensive operations. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=445.4s)]
*  We are helping. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=449.2s)]
*  But do you share the president's assessment that the way to finish this is through negotiating [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=450.2s)]
*  with the existing regime that the Israelis have called for the Hezbronian people to rise [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=454.52s)]
*  up against? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=458.52s)]
*  I think there's multiple ways to eliminate Iran's enrichment capability. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=460.03999999999996s)]
*  They are today what they were Thursday morning before these strikes started. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=464.44s)]
*  As the president has said repeatedly, they can make a deal or there's going to be bombing. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=468.28s)]
*  I want to move to some domestic issues, but very quickly, I know in the past you have [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=472.68s)]
*  said that former officials who have a direct threat against them from Iran should continue [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=477.24s)]
*  to receive security. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=481.47999999999996s)]
*  President Trump pulled it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=482.84s)]
*  Should they get it now? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=483.84s)]
*  I think we should probably revisit the threat that all persons face. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=484.84s)]
*  Remember, President Trump faces assassination threats from Iran as well. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=488.32s)]
*  This moment of tension to ensure that no one who worked for President Trump in the first [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=491.72s)]
*  term or works for him now could be the target of Iranian agents. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=495.68s)]
*  And that security detail was pulled by the president himself. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=499.32s)]
*  On immigration, the Trump administration has decided to pull back its policy a little bit. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=501.98s)]
*  They are pausing raids on farms, hotels and restaurants. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=507.0s)]
*  Arkansas has a lot of agricultural business in your state. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=510.56s)]
*  Do you support this decision? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=514.16s)]
*  I think we need to have robust worksite enforcement. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=515.92s)]
*  I don't think ICE is going to show up at one or two restaurants where they have an illegal [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=519.36s)]
*  migrant working. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=523.52s)]
*  Usually it's unscrupulous employers who have large numbers of illegal immigrants working [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=525.02s)]
*  in their worksites. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=529.6999999999999s)]
*  And whatever worksite it is, whatever industry it is, ICE has to be able to go and enforce [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=530.8s)]
*  our immigration laws and remove illegal immigrants. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=536.36s)]
*  But the president has pulled back from that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=539.78s)]
*  That was the change in policy this week when it came to farms. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=542.4599999999999s)]
*  I don't think we should pull back on any kind of enforcement at all. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=545.8s)]
*  I think worksite enforcement in all industries needs to be able to move forward. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=548.68s)]
*  And I think ICE agents on the front lines need the support of political leadership. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=553.84s)]
*  You would want more enforcement, including in manufacturing, including in construction, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=559.3199999999999s)]
*  where it could impact the economy. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=563.36s)]
*  We should not declare any industry or any worksite that uses large numbers of illegal [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=564.52s)]
*  immigrants off limits for enforcement of federal law. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=569.9s)]
*  I also want to ask you about the enforcement today. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=573.9599999999999s)]
*  As you know, there has been outcry. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=577.16s)]
*  We've seen protests across the country because of the enforcement policies. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=579.92s)]
*  You wrote an op-ed supporting President Trump's decision to send in federalized National Guard [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=584.7199999999999s)]
*  troops and active duty Marines to California. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=589.8399999999999s)]
*  You referred to it as the threat from the radical left, an overwhelming show of force [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=593.0999999999999s)]
*  to end the riots, and talked about communities being terrorized. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=597.4799999999999s)]
*  Given the amount of tension in the country right now, is that really the language to use? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=602.2800000000001s)]
*  Yes, when you see left-wing street militias who are throwing bricks and frozen water bottles [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=607.2800000000001s)]
*  at police officers and shooting them with fireworks. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=612.08s)]
*  And unfortunately, you have mayors and governors in some places that won't allow police to [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=614.84s)]
*  maintain order. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=618.96s)]
*  The next step is to call in the National Guard. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=620.2s)]
*  And if the governor won't call in the National Guard, then the president has to federalize them. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=622.1600000000001s)]
*  We always hope that the local police are allowed to do their job and have sufficient numbers [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=626.1600000000001s)]
*  to do their job to maintain order and protect innocent life and property. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=631.12s)]
*  But if they can't or they're not allowed to, the National Guard has to be on scene to restore civil order. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=635.4399999999999s)]
*  LAPD says they were handling when things turned violent yesterday. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=639.92s)]
*  They fired rubber bullets, but they said they had it under control. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=644.8399999999999s)]
*  The LA police chief said last weekend that his forces were overwhelmed and they couldn't [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=648.0s)]
*  manage the situation. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=651.16s)]
*  Senator Cotton, thank you very much for your time today. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KibgQkWaTQ&t=652.8399999999999s)]
