*  That Hamas is giving up its demand for the IDF [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkuXhm00MI8&t=29.56s)]
*  That's the Israeli military to end the war first and to completely pull out of the strip and in Israel the defense [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkuXhm00MI8&t=32.8s)]
*  Minister said that this is the closest they've been since the last deal more than a year ago [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkuXhm00MI8&t=40.68s)]
*  Which led to the release of more than 100? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkuXhm00MI8&t=45.64s)]
*  hostages now prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under a lot of pressures namely from [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkuXhm00MI8&t=49.56s)]

*  Some kind of a deal to end the war in exchange for those hostages [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkuXhm00MI8&t=72.98s)]
*  So the domestic pressures in Israel are also quite intense and now also for the first time in a long time [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkuXhm00MI8&t=77.98s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has enough support within his coalition to survive members of that coalition [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkuXhm00MI8&t=84.02s)]
*  Leaving in protest over a ceasefire deal [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkuXhm00MI8&t=91.61999999999999s)]
*  That's been the threat for many many months that some of these more hardline members of his coalition who were [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkuXhm00MI8&t=94.74s)]
*  Against a deal to end the war would walk out and that could topple his government [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkuXhm00MI8&t=100.94s)]
*  But now Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has the support to survive that kind of a thing and so for the first time [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkuXhm00MI8&t=106.06s)]
*  We're seeing more and more hope that a deal could come through that said we also spoke to family members of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkuXhm00MI8&t=112.94s)]
