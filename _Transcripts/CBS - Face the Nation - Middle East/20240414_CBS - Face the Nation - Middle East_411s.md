# NSC's John Kirby says Iran was "utterly unsuccessful" in strikes against Israel
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw)
*  Now to coordinator for strategic communications at the White House, National Security Council, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=0.0s)]
*  John Kirby. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=4.96s)]
*  Good morning and welcome back. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=5.96s)]
*  Thank you, Margaret. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=8.64s)]
*  Well, do you believe that Iran intended these strikes to be successful and lethal or just [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=9.64s)]
*  look like they could be? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=14.72s)]
*  Oh, no question. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=16.52s)]
*  I mean, look at the size and the scale, the scope of what they fired at Israel from Iran [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=17.52s)]
*  proper. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=22.16s)]
*  More than 300 missiles and drones. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=23.16s)]
*  They wanted to cause damage. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=24.88s)]
*  No question about that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=25.96s)]
*  But they were utterly unsuccessful in doing so. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=27.24s)]
*  Well, Israel clearly has the military upper hand here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=30.08s)]
*  But the Israeli foreign minister said days ago that if that Israel will respond if Iran [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=34.44s)]
*  attacks from its territory, as you just said, they did exactly that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=40.28s)]
*  So has Israel committed to the US that they will give a heads up before they take action [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  against Iran? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=51.76s)]
*  I don't think I'm going to go into the details of the conversation that that we had last [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=52.8s)]
*  night between the president and the prime minister. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  It was a good it was a good conversation, really focused on the incredible success that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=58.92s)]
*  that Israel achieved last night with their partners. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=64.56s)]
*  I mean, to really think that things are clear about last night. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  One, Israel doesn't stand alone and the United States stands with them as well as others. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=70.36s)]
*  And two, the Israeli military does have superior capability to be able to defend itself. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=74.64s)]
*  But as for what the what the next steps are, I think I will leave that to the prime minister [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=80.06s)]
*  and the war cabinet to talk about. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=84.54s)]
*  And that war cabinet meeting is ongoing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=87.18s)]
*  But I ask because, as you know, the US has significant presence in the region, troops [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=89.22s)]
*  in Iraq, in Syria, in Jordan. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=93.94s)]
*  We do indeed. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=95.7s)]
*  And there is risk to them. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=96.7s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=97.7s)]
*  And you said and Pentagon spokesperson said that the US was not notified in advance by [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=98.7s)]
*  Israel before they carried out the April 1st attack that started this chain of events. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=103.86s)]
*  Should they have forewarned the United States? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=109.98s)]
*  And as a matter of principle, what is the US position on bombing what Iran says was [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  a diplomatic facility? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=117.86s)]
*  Again, I won't talk about the details of that particular strike. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=119.10000000000001s)]
*  To the larger point, obviously, we do have a lot of troops in Iraq and Syria going after [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  ISIS. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  We have a lot of facilities elsewhere in the region and ships at sea. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=128.82s)]
*  And so what happens there certainly has an effect on us. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=131.86s)]
*  And we do want to make sure that the conversation we want to make sure the conversations [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=136.02s)]
*  we're having with the Israelis are as contextual as possible so that we can make the necessary [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=139.94s)]
*  preparations for our own troops and facilities. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=144.48s)]
*  The other message the president sent over the last few days, and certainly it was discussed [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=147.2s)]
*  last night, is we're going to take whatever steps we need to take to protect our troops, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=151.1s)]
*  our ships, our facilities in the region going forward. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=156.62s)]
*  And that was the case last night before the strikes last night. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=159.82s)]
*  And it's going to be the case today going forward. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=162.74s)]
*  Does the US need to be prepared to draw down a presence from any of our diplomatic facilities? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=164.78s)]
*  That's a conversation that the president and Secretary Blinken are having literally in [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=169.66s)]
*  real time. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=173.38s)]
*  They talked about that as well yesterday. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=174.38s)]
*  I won't speak for Secretary Blinken in the State Department. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=175.70000000000002s)]
*  They'll make those kinds of force protection decisions as they see the threat in the region. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=178.1s)]
*  But the threat changes from time to time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  And you're always monitoring that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=185.06s)]
*  I know you don't want to go into a phone call between leaders, but the fundamental premise [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=186.54000000000002s)]
*  of what we're talking about here is the blowback for the United States. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=191.22s)]
*  So do you have reason to believe that Prime Minister Netanyahu shares the desire not to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=195.7s)]
*  escalate this further, which the president has made clear is his intent? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=201.57999999999998s)]
*  I would say that the prime minister is well aware that the president is not looking for [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  a conflict with Iran, that the president doesn't want the tensions to escalate anymore, and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=211.06s)]
*  that their president is doing everything it has since the 7th of October to try to keep [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=215.29999999999998s)]
*  this from becoming a broader regional war. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=220.01999999999998s)]
*  One of the reasons we were able to help the Israelis knock down so many of these missiles [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=222.42000000000002s)]
*  and drones is because the president made decisions in recent days to pre-position additional [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=227.06s)]
*  ships in the eastern Mediterranean and an extra fighter squadron in the region that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=230.94s)]
*  literally had a huge impact on last night. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=235.98000000000002s)]
*  To deter what could have been worse. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=238.86s)]
*  To prevent a greater sense of destruction inside Israel. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=241.16000000000003s)]
*  Would the U.S. participate in offensive action if there is an Israeli reprisal? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=246.22s)]
*  I'm not going to get into hypotheticals, Margaret. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=250.74s)]
*  As I said, the president's made it clear. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=252.54s)]
*  We're not looking for a war with Iran. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=255.34s)]
*  We're not looking for a broader regional conflict. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=256.7s)]
*  And everything we've been doing since the 7th has been designed to prevent that outcome. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=258.62s)]
*  Because the IRGC chief of staff went on TV saying they sent a message to the U.S. via [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=263.3s)]
*  the Swiss embassy saying if the U.S. participates in an Israeli reprisal, U.S. bases and personnel [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  will not be in the security zone. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=273.62s)]
*  Yeah, I'm mindful of the comment and the statement. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=275.65999999999997s)]
*  Again, I'm just going back to what I said before. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=278.3s)]
*  We're not looking for a war with Iran. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=280.3s)]
*  Not looking for a broader regional conflict. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=281.98s)]
*  But the other thing the president has made clear is we will do what we have to do to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=283.86s)]
*  help Israel defend itself. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=287.98s)]
*  And we did last night. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=289.64s)]
*  And we will do everything we need to do to make sure our troops, our facilities, and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=291.06s)]
*  our ships at sea in the region are also protected. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=294.3s)]
*  We have interest in the region, too. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=297.04s)]
*  Now, obviously we're all focused on Israel and rightly so. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=298.42s)]
*  But we have broader national security interests in the Middle East. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=301.02s)]
*  We have a forced posture that we're constantly monitoring to make sure we can meet those [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=303.66s)]
*  interests. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=307.14s)]
*  The president takes that seriously. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=308.14s)]
*  And that has been communicated to Iran as well. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=309.46s)]
*  And the Iraqi prime minister will be at the White House this week talking about that troop [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=312.0s)]
*  presence as well. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=316.4s)]
*  Tomorrow. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=317.4s)]
*  Tomorrow. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=318.4s)]
*  Yes, we do anticipate having a good discussion about not just the forced posture, but the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=319.4s)]
*  mission set inside Iraq and what that looks like. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=324.3s)]
*  I think you know it's an advise and assist mission. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=326.48s)]
*  It's to help the Iraqi defense forces and their operations to go after ISIS inside Iraq. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=329.34s)]
*  The Mossad announced this morning that Hamas rejected this latest proposal for the release [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=336.29999999999995s)]
*  of hostages, saying it proves Yajas and Wahar, the Hamas leader in Gaza, does not want a [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=340.96s)]
*  deal. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=346.52s)]
*  Does the U.S. share that assessment? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=347.52s)]
*  Is the diplomacy dead or is this just another bump in the road? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  We're not considering diplomacy dead. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=352.4s)]
*  There is a new deal on the table that Director Burns negotiated a week or so ago in Cairo. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=353.82s)]
*  It is a good deal. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=358.88s)]
*  It would get dozens of the most at risk women, elderly, the wounded out, get us a six-week [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=359.96s)]
*  ceasefire so a little bit more calm, and get us an opportunity to get more humanitarian [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=366.44s)]
*  assistance in. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=370.28s)]
*  The Hamas leaders need to take that deal. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=371.28s)]
*  And we're not considering this dead at this point. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=374.2s)]
*  So that Mossad rejection is not closing the door. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=376.64s)]
*  We're not considering it a dead letter. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=379.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  Last Sunday when you were here, you told us that the U.S. expected to have talks with [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=382.03999999999996s)]
*  Perhaps as soon as this week about their plans to go into southern Gaza, in Tarafa. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=387.16s)]
*  When is that happening? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=392.12s)]
*  Do we have any further details? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=393.12s)]
*  We think that discussion, first of all, there's been some staff technical level talks even [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCD8cMfVKw&t=394.84s)]
