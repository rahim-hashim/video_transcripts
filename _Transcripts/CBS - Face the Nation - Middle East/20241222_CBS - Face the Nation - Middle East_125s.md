*  Like the most simple basic human right is to know if someone is alive or dead. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNmrL2ciY28&t=80.38s)]
*  While we were talking, one person, after the other, showed us photos of their disappeared [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNmrL2ciY28&t=84.98s)]

*  A shared strength found at this seemingly endless wall of pain. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNmrL2ciY28&t=115.74s)]
*  In Fiyad Tayyab, CBS News, Damascus. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNmrL2ciY28&t=121.53999999999999s)]
