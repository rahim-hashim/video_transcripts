# Man identifying as American named Travis Timmerman freed from Syrian prison
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4)
*  Welcome back. A man identifying himself as an American from Missouri says he was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=0.0s)]
*  freed from a Syrian prison after rebel forces overthrew the president. He tells [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=5.0s)]
*  CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer he was held in [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=10.56s)]
*  captivity for half a year. The first we knew of him was in a social media post [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=14.56s)]
*  this morning showing a bearded man on a mattress and local people claiming he [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=21.6s)]
*  was an American prisoner who'd been locked up in one of the regime's most [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=26.56s)]
*  notorious jails. We found the house about 15 miles south of Damascus and there was [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=30.04s)]
*  Travis Timmerman from Urbana, Missouri. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=36.32s)]
*  Timmerman had been imprisoned for seven months after crossing Syria's border [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=43.12s)]
*  illegally on a Christian pilgrimage. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=48.32s)]
*  What was the hardest part for you being in prison? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  There really there wasn't a hard part. It wasn't too bad. It wasn't bad. I was [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=55.68s)]
*  never beaten. The only really bad part was that I couldn't go to the bathroom [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=62.44s)]
*  when I wanted to. I was only let out three times a day to go to the bathroom [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=68.2s)]
*  so that was quite the hardship. And you had food and water? I did. On Sunday night the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  prison guards vanished and Monday morning a group of local men broke down [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=82.28s)]
*  the doors and let everyone go into a brand new Syria whose dictator had been [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=86.44s)]
*  toppled by Islamist fighters. Timmerman had no idea. The men who freed you are the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=92.36s)]
*  fighters who just come down from Idlib. So they've taken all the main cities in Syria. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=100.08s)]
*  What's there now in control? Did you know that? No. All I've heard is that the old president is he left and that there's a new government. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=107.16s)]
*  You've got more than you bargained for, haven't you? Huh. Well, I'm here. Yeah. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=118.16s)]
*  Now Timmerman said when he was leaving the prison he was trying to head towards [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=126.16s)]
*  Jordan. A woman claiming she's the cousin to Travis Timmerman released a statement [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=130.68s)]
*  as well. She says back in May received an email that he was going somewhere and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=135.16s)]
*  wouldn't have internet for a few days. That was sent to one of his friends. We [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=139.6s)]
*  weren't sure if that was legit or not. We didn't even know if he was being held [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=143.76s)]
*  in prison until this morning. For seven months all we knew was that he disappeared. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=148.48s)]
*  We didn't know if he was dead or alive. This is the best Christmas gift we could [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  have gotten. He went on this trip with his own free will and wanted to take [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=158.24s)]
*  this spiritual journey. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke on this [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=162.96s)]
*  story just moments ago. Let's take a listen to that. In terms of American [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=166.96s)]
*  citizen who was found just today, I can't give you any details on exactly [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=172.72s)]
*  what's going to happen except to say that we're working to bring him home, to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  bring him out of Syria and to bring him home. But for privacy reasons I can't [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  share any more detail than that. Any update on Austin Tice? No update on Austin Tice except to say that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=183.8s)]
*  every single day we are working to find him and to bring him home, making sure [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=190.12s)]
*  that the word is out to everyone that this is a priority for the United States. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEw9OqEbov4&t=196.16000000000003s)]
