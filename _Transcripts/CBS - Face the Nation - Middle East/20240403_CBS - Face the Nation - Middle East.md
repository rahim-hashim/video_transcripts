# Palestinian American doctor on walking out of White House meeting | extended interview
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M)
*  Doctor, thank you for making the time to talk to us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=2.68s)]
*  So you walked out of this meeting with President Biden yesterday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=4.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=8.2s)]
*  What made you come here to Washington and then go to the White House and accept the invitation? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=8.68s)]
*  I mean, I think there's a lot of us right now that have a serious sense of urgency and panic [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=12.88s)]
*  about what's taking place in Gaza and specifically about the looming Rafah invasion that could take place [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=17.28s)]
*  where there are 1.7 million Palestinians. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=23.68s)]
*  Everybody's concerned. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=25.88s)]
*  Everybody in the international NGO community, every Palestinian American, Arab American, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=26.96s)]
*  Muslim American, people who are invested in this, we're very nervous about what's taking place. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  And so it seems to me that there's one person who can maybe make a difference and could put a stop to this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=36.28s)]
*  And that's President Biden. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=42.36s)]
*  Well, President Biden says he is trying to redirect Israel from a full on assault in [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=43.96s)]
*  Rafah, southern Gaza, where there is this concentration of civilians gathered. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=50.28s)]
*  But from what you discussed yesterday, do you think the president's doing enough? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=56.16s)]
*  I mean, I certainly don't think so. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=62.44s)]
*  And it's not just me who believes that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  I was in New York last week prior to the UN Security Council resolution. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=65.84s)]
*  I talked to many member states, many members of the Security Council, and they all felt that if the White [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=69.96s)]
*  House decided to make Rafah a red line, that the war would stop tomorrow, that it just required [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=74.96s)]
*  President Biden to say under no circumstance can this take place. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=80.64s)]
*  Tell me what happened inside the room when President Biden and Vice President [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=84.76s)]
*  Harris sat down at the table. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=88.84s)]
*  Who was there? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=91.12s)]
*  What did you share with them? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it was myself, the only Palestinian American in the room. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  There were other medical professionals who were going to bear witness firsthand, eyewitness [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=97.36s)]
*  testimony to the humanitarian catastrophe. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=101.68s)]
*  They had been in Gaza themselves. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=104.28s)]
*  They had been in Gaza themselves. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=105.68s)]
*  And their testimony obviously was going to be very important because what we heard was that this would [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  be the first time that the president was going to hear from people who had been in Gaza on the ground [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=111.4s)]
*  after October 7th. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=116.76s)]
*  And also, there were various members from the Muslim American community and members of the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=118.32s)]
*  administration. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=122.24s)]
*  And President Biden walks in, says very few words, says something to the effect of, we know you [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=123.32s)]
*  guys have been working hard. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=128.8s)]
*  This is going to be a listening session. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=130.2s)]
*  We know a little bit about what's taking place. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=131.84s)]
*  And then he pointed at me and asked me to start. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=134.48s)]
*  And that's when I just kind of communicated that message about Rafah, about the concerns that I had [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=136.84s)]
*  having been in Khan Yunus and watching the hospital that I was in fall under siege and become [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  defunct and all of the massive amount of people that migrated to Rafah and were sheltering there [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  now and that there's no way, there's no alternative. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=153.0s)]
*  There is no safe way to do this. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=155.8s)]
*  It would be an absolute massacre if there's an invasion into Rafah. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  And then I asked to be excused out of respect for my community who's mourning, who's grieving, who [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=161.44s)]
*  has really wanted to be heard and has felt silence and excluded this entire time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=166.64s)]
*  And I handed him a letter from an eight year old. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=171.55999999999997s)]
*  Her name is Hadil. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  She's an orphan and she's in Rafah right now. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  And basically she said she was begging the president not to invade. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=176.67999999999998s)]
*  And you shared that letter with us as well. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=181.6s)]
*  Tell me, as a Palestinian-American who has also gone in and worked in the hospitals in Gaza, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=185.0s)]
*  what did you see? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=192.04s)]
*  And I understand you're going back. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=193.44s)]
*  Why is it worth the risk when so many aid workers have been killed going in just trying to help? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=196.16s)]
*  Why are you volunteering to go in? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=202.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, there's a couple of things. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=205.44s)]
*  We were at Nosset Hospital. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=206.6s)]
*  It was the second largest hospital in the Gaza Strip, the last remaining hospital that could do [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=207.8s)]
*  multiple surgeries at the same time. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=213.12s)]
*  And we were overwhelmed treating people on the floor. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=214.88s)]
*  I mean, there were families sheltering in and around the hospital, 10,000 of them literally in the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=217.68s)]
*  hallways of the hospitals. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=221.68s)]
*  That's where they were sheltering. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=222.88s)]
*  And we had no space. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=224.28s)]
*  We had no medicine. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=225.6s)]
*  And then we watched that hospital get raided. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=226.72s)]
*  Seventy of the health care workers abducted. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=229.48s)]
*  Already 400 health care workers have been killed. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=231.76s)]
*  By who? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  By the Israeli military. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=234.6s)]
*  And it's important to note that the Israeli military has done this to multiple hospitals. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=236.04s)]
*  I mean, this is not just a one-time incident. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=240.2s)]
*  So what I saw were families in these hospitals. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  I saw children playing ring around the rosy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=244.76s)]
*  I saw kids who were affected by this war, who had been injured by it, who had been traumatized by it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=246.76s)]
*  And it's been Al-Nasir, Shifa, Al-Rantiisi, Kamal Adwan. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=251.4s)]
*  I can list hospital after hospital. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=256.0s)]
*  And so that's really what makes me want to go back, is realizing that these people in the Gaza Strip [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=258.04s)]
*  are under a tremendous amount of pressure and pain, including the health care workers, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=263.0s)]
*  including the aid workers. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  And if it's not people like us who are going to stand with them because the entire world has [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=268.88s)]
*  turned their back on them, then who else is going to do it? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=273.24s)]
*  When you were working in the hospital, did you and your fellow doctors witness any terror [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=275.8s)]
*  infrastructure, any work from Hamas or other terror groups operating in the area? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=281.16s)]
*  We saw the opposite of that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=285.92s)]
*  We saw tiny mattresses where families of four and five would be staying in hospital corridors and in hallways. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  We saw rooms that were flooded with kids, with elderly people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=293.48s)]
*  I mean, a room that should be having one or two patients had six. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=297.16s)]
*  We saw pharmacies that were essentially out of all of stock, no antibiotics, no anesthetics. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=300.72s)]
*  We saw blood that was everywhere on the floor because we didn't have enough water to clean it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=306.8s)]
*  So I didn't see any of that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=310.24s)]
*  Did you share those details with the president and vice president? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=311.68s)]
*  You know, I've been sharing those details since I've come back. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=314.76s)]
*  I've been sharing those details with anybody that will listen, senators, congressmen. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  I said that to the president and the vice president prior to leaving, that there are real people that are there, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=321.47999999999996s)]
*  innocent people, families, and they've been displaced multiple times. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=326.88s)]
*  They've lost so much, including their homes. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=330.59999999999997s)]
*  They've lost their everything, their livelihood. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=333.0s)]
*  And that the idea of an invasion in Tarafah by the Israeli military is just something that could be so disastrous [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=335.2s)]
*  to a place that's already seen so much disaster and humanitarian suffering. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=343.16s)]
*  You are a doctor in Chicago in an ER, the south side of the city. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=346.72s)]
*  You know what it can be to work in a tough neighborhood. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=352.88s)]
*  How does that compare? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=357.2s)]
*  Were you in any way prepared for what it was like? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=358.72s)]
*  There's no comparison. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=362.2s)]
*  I mean, it was overwhelming. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=363.16s)]
*  But with the injuries. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=364.64s)]
*  Yeah, overwhelming from day one. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, with respect to, we see gunshot wounds in the south side of Chicago. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=367.64s)]
*  We see stab wounds penetrating trauma. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=371.48s)]
*  We see fires and car accidents. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=373.64s)]
*  What's happening in Gaza is that you're seeing this on a massive scale. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=376.08s)]
*  There is a real intense war taking place in a very urban environment. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=379.76s)]
*  And so you see some of these injuries, but on a massive level that no system, not even the United States, would be able to handle. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=384.52s)]
*  And to be frank with you, I felt very overwhelmed. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=391.64000000000004s)]
*  And if it wasn't for my Palestinian health care workers that were holding my hand for the first several days that I was there, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=394.48s)]
*  I would have been useless and been an additional burden on them. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=400.12s)]
*  And so, I mean, I have to tip my hat to them because they are absolutely heroes in every sense of the word. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=403.12s)]
*  These are people who are not being paid. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=408.76000000000005s)]
*  These are people who have also been displaced, people who have lost family members, and they show up to work every single day. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=410.32000000000005s)]
*  And they're doing so much with so little. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=416.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, they deserve so much credit not to be detained like 200 of them are or 400 of them that have been killed. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  They deserve to be praised as heroes. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=424.96000000000004s)]
*  And that's really unfortunate. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=426.76000000000005s)]
*  You went in with the World Health Organization, is that right? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=428.92s)]
*  That's right. I'm with MedGlobal, a nonprofit organization that under the World Health Organization, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=432.24s)]
*  we joined one of their emergency medical teams into Gaza. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=436.72s)]
*  What were the majority of victims that you saw? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=440.36s)]
*  Were they adult males? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=443.8s)]
*  Were they women? Were they children? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=446.04s)]
*  What did you witness? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=448.0s)]
*  I mean, the vast majority were women and children. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  You know, we saw some fathers and brothers and young men, but the vast majority were women and children. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=451.12s)]
*  And I remember specifically an elderly woman, 66 years old, was on the back of a donkey cart because there's no fuel in Gaza. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=458.36s)]
*  So there's not a lot of cars driving around. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=465.44s)]
*  And she was hit by a drone. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=467.40000000000003s)]
*  And I remember her coming into the emergency department and just wondering what did she do to deserve that lung collapsed and paralyzed from the waist down [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=468.96000000000004s)]
*  because the bullet was lodged into her spine. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  So tell me again, though, if the importance is bearing witness, why walk out of that meeting with the president? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=479.04s)]
*  Why not make your case and sit in front of him if, as you say, he has not heard from eyewitnesses before? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=485.56s)]
*  I mean, that's an excellent question. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=493.56s)]
*  And it's something that I debated within myself of what should I do? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=494.76s)]
*  What's the proper moment here? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=497.68s)]
*  There were other physicians who were going to bear witness to the testimony. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=499.6s)]
*  They were going to make sure that that message got out. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=502.36s)]
*  You coordinated. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=504.68s)]
*  Absolutely. And I wanted to make sure that we all knew what could take place. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=505.64s)]
*  I wasn't sure that I was going to walk out of this meeting unless it felt like it was the right thing to do. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=509.56s)]
*  And when the president really didn't even mention Gaza or Palestine in his first initial comments to me, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=513.68s)]
*  I felt that I needed to get out and I needed to at least express the hurt and the pain that the entire Palestinian-American community is feeling. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=518.68s)]
*  I don't speak on their behalf. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=525.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm just one Palestinian-American. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=526.92s)]
*  But the fact that there were no other Palestinian-Americans in the room and that so many people are suffering right now, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=528.72s)]
*  it was important for me to at least communicate that hurt and to walk away from the president like we felt he's walked away from us. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=534.76s)]
*  Why do you think there were no other Palestinian-Americans in the room? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=540.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, there aren't large numbers of Palestinian-American doctors to turn to that are sort of organized and lobbying right now. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=543.44s)]
*  No, you're right. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=552.28s)]
*  And there are plenty of Palestinians who are educators, who are experts on what's going on, lawyers. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=552.84s)]
*  There are organizers, activists, many people who can contribute to the discussion and can contribute [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=559.2s)]
*  in a very meaningful way. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=564.12s)]
*  And what we've heard from them is that over the last six months, they haven't been given that opportunity. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=565.6s)]
*  Maybe a few of them have, but the vast majority feel like they've been excluded. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=570.04s)]
*  But you have in the past been a supporter of President Biden and Vice President Harris, is that right? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=574.0s)]
*  I have been a supporter. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=579.16s)]
*  I was very, very excited when President Biden was elected. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  I thought that this was going to mean a lot of different things for a lot of different people, but mostly good things. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=584.36s)]
*  And I thought that it was going to bring a change with respect to policy in the Middle East for more peace there. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=590.04s)]
*  I'm not a political person, but I was hoping for peace. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=595.04s)]
*  I'm a physician. I care about people suffering. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=597.24s)]
*  And unfortunately, these last six months have disappointed not just myself, but many people. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=599.7199999999999s)]
*  Do you know then, will you go and will you vote? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=605.68s)]
*  And will you be able on an issue of conscience for yourself? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=608.4s)]
*  Will that affect how you end up at the ballot box and which lever you pull? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=613.88s)]
*  I mean, Margaret, to be honest with you, it's affecting how I feel about the next couple of days. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=619.5999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm very it's changed everything with respect to our lives. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=623.4799999999999s)]
*  Palestinian Americans will tell you our lives are upside down. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=626.64s)]
*  We don't even know what we're going to do for the celebration for the end of month of Ramadan. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=629.2399999999999s)]
*  We don't know how what next week is going to look like. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=633.1199999999999s)]
*  We're all worried about what's happening in Gaza. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=635.28s)]
*  And so, you know, people. Yeah, we know people. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=637.3199999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. And, you know, there has been intense following of this, of what's going on. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=639.8399999999999s)]
*  We know the intimate details of people who are suffering in Gaza. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  We know their names. We know the family members that have been lost. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=647.0799999999999s)]
*  We know about the kids that haven't been in school for six months. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=649.76s)]
*  And so for us, it affects everything in our lives. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=652.64s)]
*  And it's going to affect how we vote. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=655.52s)]
*  It's going to affect how we feel about the political engagement that in this country, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=656.8s)]
*  it's going to affect how we feel about policy in the Middle East. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=660.8399999999999s)]
*  And I can tell you that it's not just people who are angry and frustrated. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=663.56s)]
*  It's people who are mourning and grieving. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=667.4s)]
*  Do you believe that you were able to attend that meeting because of the political risk? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=670.04s)]
*  Or because there is an openness to policy change? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=676.72s)]
*  Oh, I think, yeah, I think I was able to attend that meeting because there is some posturing [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=681.24s)]
*  or there is a change in rhetoric. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=687.1600000000001s)]
*  And I can acknowledge that there is a change in rhetoric with respect to what's happening in Gaza. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=689.24s)]
*  By the Biden administration. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=693.36s)]
*  By the Biden administration, acknowledging the humanitarian suffering. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=694.4s)]
*  But at six months, it needs to be a lot more than rhetoric. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=697.44s)]
*  And I think what people are looking for are concrete steps towards peace, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=700.12s)]
*  towards a ceasefire, towards a fighting and invasion of Rafah and towards getting people food and water. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=704.56s)]
*  And so that's not what we're seeing. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=710.64s)]
*  And I think that's what we're demanding. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=712.24s)]
*  Dr. Ahmed, thank you for your time. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=714.84s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4xdh485M&t=716.4s)]
