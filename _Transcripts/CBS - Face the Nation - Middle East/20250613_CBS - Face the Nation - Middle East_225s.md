# Examining Israel's intelligence capabilities inside Iran
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ)
*  When it turned out of Sam Vindman, Sam Vinograd, forgive me, national security contributor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=0.0s)]
*  here at CBS News. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=6.22s)]
*  Talk to me about how this played out in terms of evaluating Israeli intelligence inside [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=7.9s)]
*  Iran. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Well, Major, I've worked with Israeli intelligence, the Mossad as well, particularly when it comes [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  to Iran. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  And let me tell you this, intelligence operations just don't happen overnight. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  And there is reporting in the Times of Israel and elsewhere that really speaks to the fact [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=25.98s)]
*  that this operation inside of Iran was months, if not years, in the works. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=30.02s)]
*  Mossad, for example, yesterday evening, assassinated top nuclear scientists. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=36.06s)]
*  There were Mossad operatives on the ground that engaged in these assassinations. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=41.74s)]
*  There were Mossad operatives on the ground that helped launch drones from inside Iran [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=45.78s)]
*  to strike targets. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=51.42s)]
*  And so what that tells us is that this operation was being planned for a long time, sources [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=52.42s)]
*  were cultivated, and somehow the Mossad was able to do all of this under the radar of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=57.5s)]
*  Iran's own intelligence services. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  So this is a black eye to Iranian intelligence, while also this operation served to actually [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=65.26s)]
*  damage Iranian capabilities. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=70.7s)]
*  The Israeli assumption is right now Iran is vulnerable. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=73.12s)]
*  proxies, Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Syrian regime. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=77.18s)]
*  And this penetration, intelligence penetration of Iran would also suggest it's vulnerable [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=83.58000000000001s)]
*  even beyond the way the map makes it look vulnerable. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=89.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=92.78s)]
*  And as you may recall, Israel launched other assassinations within Iran over the past year. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=93.78s)]
*  So it's very clear that Iranian intelligence just can't keep up with the Mossad and that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  senior Iranian officials, top military brass, top nuclear scientists, are all accessible [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=104.74s)]
*  targets to Israeli intelligence. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=111.22s)]
*  At the same time, Israel's last strike several months ago took out Iranian air defense systems. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=113.38s)]
*  What that means in layman's terms is that Iran has less capability to defend against [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=119.33999999999999s)]
*  missiles. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=124.46s)]
*  So on many fronts, Iran is vulnerable. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=125.46s)]
*  Israel is not sitting back on its heels, however. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=128.42s)]
*  Israel is activating its own air defense system to try to protect against an Iranian response. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=131.34s)]
*  Israel is very much expecting that Iran is going to up the ante and try to hurt Israel [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=136.82s)]
*  as much as Israel has hurt Iran. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=140.78s)]
*  What should we watch for in the next 48, 72 hours? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=142.5s)]
*  Well, we should watch to see whether Iran actually tries to target U.S. assets, both [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=145.46s)]
*  overseas in the Middle East, in Israel, in other parts of Europe, for example, or even [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=150.54s)]
*  here in the homeland. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=156.54s)]
*  In my experience, within our own borders, Iran could choose to activate proxies to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=157.54s)]
*  strike targets in the U.S. if Iran thinks that the U.S. was actively involved in this [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=162.66s)]
*  operation. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=167.78s)]
*  We know that the U.S. did provide support to Israel intercepting Iranian missiles striking [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=168.78s)]
*  Israel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  What we don't really know yet, Major, is whether the U.S. was involved in Israel's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  strike against Iran in some capacity. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=181.01999999999998s)]
*  It would be an enormous risk for Iran to strike out at the United States at this particular [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=182.86s)]
*  moment, would it not? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  It would, although sometimes Iran denies culpability. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=189.22000000000003s)]
*  They activate their proxies. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=193.14000000000001s)]
*  A proxy is really someone that's not directly identifiable. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=194.5s)]
*  Traceable. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=197.94000000000003s)]
*  Yes, and loosely affiliated with the Iranian regime. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=198.94000000000003s)]
*  Iran could activate its proxies and say, we didn't have full control over this. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=202.38000000000002s)]
*  When I was in Iraq, they did that all the time, using their proxies there. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=205.94000000000003s)]
*  Iran could seek to activate its proxies or to activate some kind of cyberattack against [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=210.5s)]
*  the U.S. and deny culpability just to send a message to the United States to back off [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=214.82000000000002s)]
*  and not support Israel in this endeavor. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=219.66000000000003s)]
*  Sam Vinograd, great to have you here at the family table. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=221.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=223.46s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=224.46s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0UrT9iLQ&t=225.46s)]
