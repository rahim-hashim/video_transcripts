# Latest updates on the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8)
*  That's very interesting that you mentioned those European countries, because the relationship [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=0.0s)]
*  with our typical allies has been so rocky for the past few months. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=4.26s)]
*  So it will definitely be interesting to see how these other nations respond to this attack. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=9.3s)]
*  Let's take a look at the history of how this came to be at this moment in terms of the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=14.42s)]
*  situation with Israel and Iran. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=21.22s)]
*  Talk about that a little bit, Courtney, and how we got involved at this point. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=23.72s)]
*  Well, we'll go back to 1979 with the Islamic Revolution. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=28.78s)]
*  The U.S. had been a great supporter of the Shah, and the Shah was deposed. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=34.1s)]
*  And what took the Shah's place was an Islamist organization group that believes that the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=39.18s)]
*  12th Imam was supposed to come back to the world and for that Imam, that saint, to be [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=47.540000000000006s)]
*  received well, that Iran needed to be in the hands of fundamentalists, people that were [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=55.06s)]
*  pious but believed in all sorts of culture that many find extremist. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=59.940000000000005s)]
*  So there were crackdowns, and women had to wear hijab, and there was all sorts of ways [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=65.58s)]
*  that people could not have any human rights in Iran. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=71.2s)]
*  Also Iran saw Israel as an enemy and the U.S. as an enemy, especially with the U.S. getting [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=74.98s)]
*  involved in places like Beirut during the Lebanese Civil War. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=80.94s)]
*  There was the U.S. Marines' barracks bombings. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=86.3s)]
*  There was the U.S. Embassy bombings and the annex bombings. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=88.78s)]
*  Iran had basically stood up proxy militias trained in the Beqaa Valley of Lebanon to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=92.53999999999999s)]
*  base themselves in southern Lebanon and fight Israel, and that would be Hezbollah. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=98.18s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, after what's been happening in Gaza, last October he ran roughshod over [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=106.14s)]
*  Lebanon and pretty much diluted and got rid of and decapitated the leadership of Hassan [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=112.98s)]
*  Mastrolla. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=120.62s)]
*  He died in an airstrike, which pretty much took all the power away from Hezbollah, so [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=121.82s)]
*  that doesn't menace Israel. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=126.78s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu is intent on not really having a ceasefire Hamas until he [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=129.94s)]
*  can say that every Hamas member is dead. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=135.1s)]
*  And while there are question marks about that, he has taken Hamas and it basically neutralized [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=137.5s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=143.66s)]
*  So these were issues that were kept up in America in the 80s and Iran bombing in Buenos [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=144.66s)]
*  Aires and Israeli terrorists in Bulgaria and regional wars popping up every now and then. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=151.58s)]
*  But it's never really happened between the two foes, the two archenemies, which are Israel [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=159.82s)]
*  and Iran, but then also the U.S. and Iran, and that comes from history pre-1979, the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=165.85999999999999s)]
*  mullahs taking over and saying that the U.S. is the great Satan, and then the U.S. getting [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  involved and Iran striking back with terrorist attacks. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=181.7s)]
*  So there is history here. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=185.01999999999998s)]
*  But there also had been a nuclear deal that President Trump took us out of, tried to get [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=187.7s)]
*  one back, clearly wanted the peace and the deal. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=193.02s)]
*  And that's not how this has gone since Israel bombed Iran several days before what was supposed [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=196.82s)]
*  to be the sixth round of talks between the U.S. and Iran. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=204.98s)]
*  Instead, Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government acted unilaterally [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=209.82s)]
*  and launched airstrikes all over Iran and different places, including some of the nuclear [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=216.7s)]
*  plant they could degrade from above ground and also against oil refineries, gas depots, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=221.7s)]
*  straight into Tehran, which is densely populated. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=229.66s)]
*  This was not something that President Trump had signed onto. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=234.1s)]
*  And now he's reacting. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=238.5s)]
*  He's gone a step further with this U.S. involvement for the first time being offensive, not defensive [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=241.34s)]
*  in this since Israel bombed a week, nearly a week and a half ago. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=248.5s)]
*  And in the president's truth social message, was there any indication as to what made him [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=253.1s)]
*  decide that the U.S. would do this today of all days? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=259.24s)]
*  No. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=263.94s)]
*  And I say that a little bit surprised because it came out of I wasn't expecting it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=265.9s)]
*  It came out of nowhere. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=271.38s)]
*  I like I said, I'd seen that B-2 bombers had been moved to Guam by knowing that they were [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=272.38s)]
*  no longer just in the states. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=277.5s)]
*  That meant by closer proximity that they could be used. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=279.66s)]
*  But there was no expectation and no heads up that they would be used today. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=284.1s)]
*  There's no post information about why President Trump did it today rather than any other time, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=290.26s)]
*  maybe by the element of surprise on a Saturday. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=298.62s)]
*  But there are no significant dates or anything that could be mentioned right off the top [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=301.94s)]
*  of my head. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=305.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=306.74s)]
*  Especially considering that he gave Iran a new deadline saying that he would decide within [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=307.74s)]
*  the next two weeks whether this would be taking place or not. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=312.34s)]
*  Here we are today that three sites in Iran have been bombed. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=316.22s)]
*  We have a map of the location, Courtney. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=321.22s)]
*  Let's go over once again which areas in Iran were hit right now and how far away these [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=323.70000000000005s)]
*  areas are to populated cities in Iran. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=330.46000000000004s)]
*  I would have to because I'm on the phone, I'm not going to be able to see that map. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=335.94s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=342.3s)]
*  So I'm not going to really be speaking to population centers right now, but I think [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=343.62s)]
*  you can point to see that there's, there, Isfahan is near the town of Isfahan for instance. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=348.38s)]
*  You can see that how large the country is. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=359.22s)]
*  You want to see how close or far away it is from Tehran. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=363.98s)]
*  If you can point, if there's something that says Tehran, look to Tehran and then look [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=368.34000000000003s)]
*  at the borders of Iran and where these three places are. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=372.65999999999997s)]
*  You're looking for Natanz, you're looking for Fordow and you're looking for Isfahan. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=376.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, we're looking at those areas right now. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=385.65999999999997s)]
*  Fordow, you've mentioned. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=387.78s)]
*  Now the thing is what you're talking about which is really crucial too is what kind of [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=388.78s)]
*  radioactive levels above ground would this create for any populations nearby? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=393.18s)]
*  And when Natanz had been hit earlier, several days ago, earlier in the week, the IAEA announced [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=401.18s)]
*  that there was danger from chemicals inside Natanz but not outside. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=408.62s)]
*  And that Isfahan was fine and that Fordow really hadn't been touched. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=416.90000000000003s)]
*  Now if Fordow is completely gone, we have to start thinking about radioactivity levels [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=421.98s)]
*  as well. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=428.06s)]
*  So the top nuclear that I know says this is just too early to tell. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=431.21999999999997s)]
*  Too early to tell. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=441.86s)]
*  OK, so what do we know about the conditions of these sites right now, Courtney? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=442.86s)]
*  We know that there are nuclear plants and we know that the U.S. president decided to [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=449.14s)]
*  bomb them. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=454.98s)]
*  We know that he's speaking at 10 p.m. tonight Eastern time, that he will hopefully give [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=456.02000000000004s)]
*  more information that he has on that breaking news that he put out on Truth Social. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=461.70000000000005s)]
*  He says Fordow is gone. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=466.74s)]
*  There were B-2 bombers that had been moved to Guam. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=469.78000000000003s)]
*  If the U.S. used a B-2 bomber with a 30,000 pound bomb, which only the U.S. has, which [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=473.70000000000005s)]
*  Israel does not, we're going to need to hear that from the president. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=479.38s)]
*  He probably is preparing his remarks, but President Trump does what President Trump [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=484.90000000000003s)]
*  needs to and wants to at the time. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=491.34000000000003s)]
*  So I would advise monitoring his Truth Social and waiting for his remarks to this nation. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=492.98s)]
*  Which will come at 10 p.m. Eastern time, which is just about an hour and 15 minutes from [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=500.86s)]
*  now. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=506.54s)]
*  We will be hearing from the president to see what made him make this decision. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=507.54s)]
*  Very shocking to the world. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=512.86s)]
*  The BBC was on discussing this. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=515.22s)]
*  The entire world is discussing this as to why the president made this decision after [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=517.7s)]
*  saying that he would be giving Iran two weeks to do what it needed to do. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=522.22s)]
*  Let's talk about that a little bit. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=527.66s)]
*  What did he want Iran to do? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=529.1800000000001s)]
*  What was this deadline? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=531.42s)]
*  What did he expect Iran to do within these two weeks that he said that he would be giving them? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=532.54s)]
*  He didn't really stay any expectation. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=538.94s)]
*  I think he was expecting diplomacy and he wanted Iran to talk to him. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=541.62s)]
*  He wants the deal. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=546.98s)]
*  He wants to be the deal maker. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=548.82s)]
*  I mean, obviously, Bernie Sanders is announcing Trump's quote, illegal attack on Iran. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=550.74s)]
*  But the president has not been into making wars. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=557.54s)]
*  He's been into making peace. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=562.42s)]
*  But now, these GBU-57 bunker-buster bombs were dropped on Iran's underground nuclear [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=564.62s)]
*  facility reportedly in Fordow. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=572.58s)]
*  And the president is going to have to tell us more about that. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=575.14s)]
*  The speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, was reportedly informed at events about this. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=578.42s)]
*  It remains unclear whether the full gang of eight were also informed on time. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=584.1s)]
*  That's the speaker of the House, the House Minority Leader, the Senate Majority Leader, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=589.62s)]
*  and the Senate Minority Leader, as well as the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=595.14s)]
*  Committee, among others. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=599.34s)]
*  So we have, we're going to have to wait. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=601.58s)]
*  Carolyn Levitt, the White House press secretary, is just saying tune in at 10 p.m. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGN3fieoD8&t=606.06s)]
