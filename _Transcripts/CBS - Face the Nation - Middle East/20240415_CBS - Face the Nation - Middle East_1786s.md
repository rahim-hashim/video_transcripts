# Pentagon discusses U.S. response to Iran's attack on Israel and more
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts)
*  Good afternoon, everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks for your flexibility today. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=3.04s)]
*  A little bit later, just a few things, and then we'll get right to your questions. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=5.2s)]
*  First of all, as you saw over the weekend at the direction of the President and in support [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=10.56s)]
*  of Israel's defense, U.S. forces in the Middle East intercepted dozens of missiles and uncrewed [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=14.64s)]
*  aerial vehicles after Iran and its proxies launched more than 300 air threats on the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=20.32s)]
*  of April 13 and the morning of April 14 from Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen en route to Israel [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=26.56s)]
*  to include over 110 medium-range ballistic missiles, over 30 land attack cruise missiles, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=32.96s)]
*  and over 150 UAVs. U.S. Central Command highlighted in their press release that CENTCOM [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=39.36s)]
*  forces, supported by the U.S. Navy destroyers USS Arleigh Burke and USS Kearney, currently [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=46.32s)]
*  assigned to the European Command AOR, successfully engaged and destroyed more than 80 one-way [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=52.64s)]
*  attack UAVs and at least six ballistic missiles intended to strike Israel from Iran and Yemen. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  This included a ballistic missile on its launcher vehicle and seven UAVs destroyed on the ground [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=64.08s)]
*  in Iranian-backed Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen prior to their launch. Secretary Austin [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  is grateful for the professionalism and skill of the brave U.S. troops who took part in the defense [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=74.8s)]
*  of Israel and who continue to stand guard to prevent further conflict or escalation. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=79.6s)]
*  Throughout the weekend and into today, Secretary Austin has held multiple calls with international [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=85.52s)]
*  partners and allies, as well as with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, senior DOD leaders, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=90.8s)]
*  and the CENTCOM and UCOM commanders to actively monitor the situation and reinforce U.S. and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  international resolve in the face of Iranian aggression. Secretary Austin has also been in [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=101.84s)]
*  frequent contact with his Israeli counterpart, Minister Golan, speaking to him three times over [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=108.16s)]
*  the weekend. During their most recent call yesterday, the two leaders reviewed the successful [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=113.2s)]
*  combined operation by the United States, Israel, and their partners to defend Israel from these [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  unprecedented attacks by Iran and its proxies and emphasized that while the United States does not [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=122.96s)]
*  seek escalation, we will continue to take all necessary action to defend Israel and U.S. personnel. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=129.04s)]
*  Shifting gears, Secretary Austin welcomed Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Sha'at al-Sadani to the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=136.32000000000002s)]
*  Pentagon today to discuss the strategic nature of the U.S.-Iraqi bilateral defense relationship [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  and Iraq's role as a leader in ensuring regional security. Upon conclusion of the meeting, which is [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=147.28s)]
*  occurring as we speak, we'll issue a full readout. Finally of note, Secretary Austin also spoke today [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=152.8s)]
*  with his counterparts from Germany, Kuwait, and Qatar. Readouts from these calls will be published [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  later today on defense.gov. With that, I'd be glad to take your questions. We'll go first [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=163.68s)]
*  to Associated Press, who believes on the phone. Lita Belldor. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=168.24s)]
*  MS. HARF. Thanks, Pat. I was wondering if you were able at this point to provide any more details [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=171.12s)]
*  on the U.S. response, including do you have the number of U.S. aircraft involved, tankers and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=179.6s)]
*  things like that, any more granularity on U.S. response? And I know it's early, but is there [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=189.44s)]
*  sort of an estimated cost of the U.S. response? And then I have one just on the meeting with [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=196.48s)]
*  Iraq today. Did the Secretary discuss the ongoing issue of the U.S. reducing its troop presence [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=204.0s)]
*  in Iraq? And does what just happened in Israel and the fact that some U.S. forces in Iraq were [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=214.48s)]
*  involved in the response, does that – was that discussed as far as the need to maintain any U.S. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  forces in Iraq? MR. MULLER. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=230.72s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Lita. Ticking your last question first, as mentioned, the meeting is ongoing right [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=233.2s)]
*  now, so of course we'll have a readout of that meeting. As you know, there is ongoing discussion [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=238.72s)]
*  through the Higher Military Commission as it relates to the U.S. support for Iraq, as it relates [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=245.84s)]
*  to the International Coalition to Defeat ISIS, and what that relationship, what that longer-term [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=253.44s)]
*  bilateral relationship will look like. So certainly not going to get ahead of that process, but we'll [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=259.2s)]
*  have much more to read out following today's meeting. As it relates to U.S. forces and the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=264.72s)]
*  response over the weekend, as you know, as a matter of operation security, we're not going to be able [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=270.08000000000004s)]
*  to go into the specifics in terms of the numbers of fighters involved at this time, other than to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=277.04s)]
*  say, again, U.S. fighters were involved in the response and participated in taking down, as I [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=283.76000000000005s)]
*  highlighted, over 80 UAVs that were, one-way attack UAVs that were en route to Israel. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=291.36s)]
*  Thank you. Jennifer. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=298.0s)]
*  Q Were you given a heads-up about the scope and scale of this attack? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=298.8s)]
*  MR. MULLER. So I think what you're asking was, did Iran give us a heads-up? No, they did not. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=303.52000000000004s)]
*  Q But were you given a heads-up through allies? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=311.6s)]
*  MR. MULLER. We were not given specifics by Iran, and to my knowledge, any specifics in terms of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=314.64s)]
*  exact times, dates. We obviously have a robust intelligence network that provides [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=322.4s)]
*  indications and warning. But to answer your specific question, no, Iran did not tell us [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=329.84s)]
*  when and where they were going to attack. Q And just in terms of the – is the U.S. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=334.08s)]
*  concerned that U.S. forces in the region would be in jeopardy if Israel retaliates for Saturday [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=337.68s)]
*  night? And is that why the U.S. is not participating in a potential retaliation? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=343.44s)]
*  MR. MULLER. Well, look, I don't want to get into hypotheticals at this point. Whether or not Israel [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=349.12s)]
*  responds to Iran's attack, of course, is something for Israel to discuss and to decide. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=354.32s)]
*  As Secretary Austin has said both publicly and privately, we don't want to see escalation, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=361.36s)]
*  but we obviously will take necessary measures to protect our forces in the region. And as was [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=368.4s)]
*  demonstrated over the weekend, we'll take necessary measures to defend Israel. Thank you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=372.88s)]
*  Q I think officials had said last week that additional U.S. assets, military assets, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=377.28s)]
*  have been sent to the region. Are those assets still in place or have they been moved out now? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  MR. MULLER. As of right now, those assets are still in place. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=387.12s)]
*  Q You've talked previously about Iran not seeking conflict with the United States. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  Is that still accurate? Do you today believe that Iran is not seeking conflict with the United [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=395.04s)]
*  States or Israel? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=399.2s)]
*  MR. MULLER. Are you asking me if Iran is speaking? I'm not going to speak for Iran. I mean, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=400.0s)]
*  certainly from the United States, we do not seek conflict with Iran. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=404.88s)]
*  Q Conflict before. So today, is that statement still accurate? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  MR. MULLER. Yeah, again, I'm not going to speak for Iran. Thanks. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=413.36s)]
*  Will. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=416.56s)]
*  Q Two questions on the Middle East. Has Israel informed the Pentagon if it plans to respond to [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=416.8s)]
*  the Iranian attack? And does DOD have any message on a potential response in terms of to Israel? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=422.24s)]
*  Second, given the number of drones and missiles that were shot down, is the Pentagon concerned [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=428.24s)]
*  about stocks of either U.S. or Israeli air defense munitions in the region? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=432.48s)]
*  MR. MULLER. Yeah, thanks, Will. So on your first question, again, I'm not going to speak for [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=436.48s)]
*  Israel or any potential response. Again, that's a decision for them to make. As we demonstrated [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=441.04s)]
*  this weekend, we remain focused on the defense of Israel and on the protection of U.S. forces that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=446.88s)]
*  are in the region. And we've been clear from the very beginning that we don't want to see a wider [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  regional war, and we continue to work hard in consulting with our partners and our allies [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=456.88s)]
*  throughout the region to ensure that there is not a larger regional war. And then on your other [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=461.84s)]
*  question, again, I'm not going to get into the specifics in terms of U.S. and partner readiness [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=468.32s)]
*  levels. Again, as we demonstrate this weekend, we have the capability and the capacity to defend [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=473.92s)]
*  Israel and to defend our forces in the region. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=478.8s)]
*  Thank you, General. I had two questions. How critical was U.S. support to defend Israel [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=481.44s)]
*  against this response by Iran? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=487.59999999999997s)]
*  MR. MULLER. Well, I think as our actions demonstrated, the U.S. support for the defense [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  of Israel is robust, and it also demonstrates the longstanding security cooperation relationship [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=494.8s)]
*  that the United States has not only with Israel but with countries throughout the region when it [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=502.08s)]
*  comes to addressing regional threats. And those kinds of things don't happen overnight. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=507.52s)]
*  Those kinds of relationships and the ability to work together, to interoperate together, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=513.68s)]
*  all played out and saved many lives. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=519.04s)]
*  MR. MULLER. And second question, this is not hypothetical. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=521.28s)]
*  Chief of the General Staff of Israel, General Halevi, made it clear today that Israel will [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=525.68s)]
*  respond. The Secretary made it clear the U.S. is not seeking escalation. The President made [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=530.4s)]
*  that clear as well. When Israel responds, do you think this will be counterproductive to your [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=537.76s)]
*  efforts for de-escalation? And will the U.S. support an Israeli response? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=546.3199999999999s)]
*  MR. MULLER. Yeah, thanks, Padi. Just we take slight exception with your question, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=550.9599999999999s)]
*  because to my knowledge right now there has been no Israeli response, so that is a hypothetical. So [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=556.24s)]
*  again, we're going to continue to stay in close consultation with our Israeli partners [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=563.36s)]
*  as we have done throughout the weekend. Again, we don't seek a wider regional conflict, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=568.5600000000001s)]
*  and I'll just leave it there. Lara. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=573.2s)]
*  MS. NULAND. So Saturday night was the biggest aerial attack of this magnitude we've seen [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=574.72s)]
*  quite some time. It's the first big test of this collective integrated air and missile defense [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=579.52s)]
*  system that we've seen that the community has been working on with its allies in the region. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=585.12s)]
*  Can you talk about any lessons that we learned from this attack, about Iran's capabilities, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=590.48s)]
*  about our own capabilities, and were there any surprises? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=596.72s)]
*  MR. MULLER. Yeah, thanks, Lara. Now, to your point, we will learn a lot from this, and we have learned [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=600.16s)]
*  a lot from this. As I'm sure you can appreciate, I'm not going to be in a position to do an [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=608.24s)]
*  after-action report from the podium today, other than to say it's pretty telling that Iran [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=613.36s)]
*  launched over 300 air threats, as I highlighted, and 99 percent of those were knocked down. So it [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=620.32s)]
*  is demonstrative of that close coordination and synchronization between the United States and [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=626.64s)]
*  coalition partners when it comes to addressing air defense threats in the region. So again, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=633.84s)]
*  we'll obviously continue to look at this and study this. Importantly, we'll continue to work [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=638.72s)]
*  closely with Israel when it comes to the defense of Israel and threats from countries like Iran [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=644.24s)]
*  going forward, but I'm sure we'll have much more to learn. Yes, sir. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=650.88s)]
*  QUESTION. Yes, for the Italian television. Is the Pentagon talking to other state in the region, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=654.48s)]
*  like the Saudi, Qatar, and Jordan, in case Israel will go for retaliation and will need [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=660.88s)]
*  military support from those countries, including the U.S.? And are the U.S. ready to use force? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=668.72s)]
*  MR. RHODES. Well, yeah, again, as I mentioned, our focus right now remains on the defense of Israel [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=675.36s)]
*  and on the protection of U.S. forces. If you take a step back and you look at U.S. force presence [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=682.48s)]
*  in the region writ large, we have been focused for a very long time on regional security and [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=687.9200000000001s)]
*  stability, and that's not going to change. When it comes to discussions that we have with our [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=692.72s)]
*  partners in the region, of course, those are opportunities, again, to reassure U.S. commitment [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=698.48s)]
*  towards working towards regional security and stability and our appreciation for the ongoing [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=705.12s)]
*  open communication and the ability to consult with leaders throughout the Middle East and Central Asia. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=712.64s)]
*  So – [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=718.16s)]
*  QUESTION. Use force in case Israel will need military support. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=719.16s)]
*  MR. RHODES. Again, I'm not going to get into hypotheticals. What you saw happen over the weekend [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=721.6s)]
*  was an incredible and extraordinary response by the U.S. and Israel and coalition partners when it [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=728.24s)]
*  came to defending Israel. And I think we've been pretty clear that we don't want to see escalation [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=735.1999999999999s)]
*  into a wider regional war, and I'll just leave it there. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=741.8399999999999s)]
*  Janie. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=744.4s)]
*  QUESTION. Thank you, General. Russia and North Korea – Russia said it would increase the [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=744.88s)]
*  deployment of strategic assets around the Korean Peninsula to keep the U.S. in check [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=752.72s)]
*  and increasing military cooperation with North Korea. What is the U.S. position on that? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=761.28s)]
*  MR. RHODES. Well, look, we've been working closely for a very long time with our ROK and Japanese [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=768.5600000000001s)]
*  allies and other allies and partners throughout the region when it comes to addressing issues like [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=775.84s)]
*  security, stability, prosperity, and to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific. And so that will [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=783.52s)]
*  continue to be our focus. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=788.24s)]
*  QUESTION. North Korea also, they considering participating in the China-Russia military [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=789.36s)]
*  exercise soon. How would you consider about this? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=797.12s)]
*  MR. RHODES. Again, I'm not going to speak for North Korea today. Let me go back over here. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=800.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=805.6s)]
*  QUESTION. Thanks, Pat. There have been reports that are saying that half of the ballistic missiles [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=806.16s)]
*  that were fired by Iran either failed to launch or hit short of the targets. Can you confirm that [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=810.48s)]
*  and then to follow up on that, did some of them land in allied territories like Jordan and Iraq? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=818.08s)]
*  MR. RHODES. Yeah. Thanks, Carla. I don't have any information to provide on that from the podium. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=824.0s)]
*  I'm certainly not going to get into intelligence from the podium. I would say in terms of failures, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=830.64s)]
*  I would just point to the fact that, again, over 300 air threats launched to targets in Israel, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=836.0s)]
*  99 percent of which were taken down. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=844.32s)]
*  MS. NULAND. I want to follow up on Idris's question, if I may. So is there going to be [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=847.12s)]
*  a deployment of additional forces into the region? Does the U.S. feel that they have [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=853.04s)]
*  appropriate force posture in the Middle East right now? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=858.4s)]
*  MR. RHODES. I don't have anything to read out or announce today in terms of force posture. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=861.12s)]
*  Of course, as a matter of course, we're constantly looking at U.S. forces around the world and [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=866.48s)]
*  where we need capabilities and assets, but don't have anything to announce today. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=872.64s)]
*  Joseph. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=876.8s)]
*  QUESTION. Thanks. Can you talk about who from the Middle East helped in these operations, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=877.1999999999999s)]
*  these counter-Iranian operations over the weekend? And then can you talk about – did you guys – did [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=883.28s)]
*  the U.S. provide any assurances that if they were to take part in these, then the U.S. would [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=888.9599999999999s)]
*  help defend any potential responses from Iran? Because we saw Iran did threaten some of these [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=895.5999999999999s)]
*  countries that reportedly took part. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=900.64s)]
*  MR. RHODES. Yeah, thanks, Joseph. I appreciate the question. As you know, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=902.64s)]
*  we're going to allow any partners to speak for themselves, so I don't want to speak for them [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=906.72s)]
*  when it comes to any participation. I'll just leave it there. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=912.08s)]
*  QUESTION. Sorry, just to push you on that. I mean, you guys have said the French and the British [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=915.6s)]
*  helped in these, so you can't talk about any other countries that helped? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=920.08s)]
*  MR. RHODES. I think the French and the British have publicly acknowledged their participation, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=923.6s)]
*  but again, I'd refer you to them to talk about their specific operations. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=928.96s)]
*  Let me go back here and then – T, sir. Yeah, one second. Yes, ma'am. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=933.2800000000001s)]
*  QUESTION. Thanks, Derral. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Kuleva seems to suggest that if Ukraine [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=937.12s)]
*  receives seven more Patriot batteries, they might be willing to stop attacking Russian oil refineries, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=941.76s)]
*  which has been criticized by U.S. officials. Is that something that's being into – taken [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=946.88s)]
*  into consideration by DOD and the Administration, or is it subject of discussions with allies? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=951.0400000000001s)]
*  MR. RHODES. I don't have anything to announce as it relates specifically to Ukrainian aid other [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=957.2s)]
*  than two things. One, we need Congress to pass the supplemental, and two, we're going to continue [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=962.08s)]
*  to consult closely with Ukraine and our allies and partners when it comes to their most immediate [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=967.76s)]
*  needs to defend themselves from Russian aggression. Yes, sir. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=972.32s)]
*  QUESTION. Thank you, General. The Iraqi prime minister is here at the Pentagon today. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=975.92s)]
*  Can you tell us what they discuss about the [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=981.36s)]
*  President's U.S. troops in Iraq and how important to you are relations between the Iraqi army [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=984.64s)]
*  and the Peshmerga forces? And I have a following question. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=991.68s)]
*  MR. RHODES. Sure. As mentioned earlier, the meeting is ongoing right now, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=995.12s)]
*  so we'll have a readout following that meeting, which will provide some additional insight into [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=998.64s)]
*  the discussions. As it relates to our views on the value of Iraqi security forces [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1003.76s)]
*  to the U.S.-Iraqi relationship, I mean, we've been working very closely together for many years now, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1010.56s)]
*  and we value Iraq as a partner, and we greatly appreciate the work and support that we've done [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1017.52s)]
*  with the Iraqi security forces, to include Peshmerga forces. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1025.36s)]
*  Louis. Oh, sorry. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1029.3600000000001s)]
*  QUESTION. As you said, General, missiles from Iraq were fired at Israel. Can you tell us from [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1030.72s)]
*  where in Iraq and which group was responsible? MR. RHODES. I can't – I don't have any [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1037.68s)]
*  information to provide in terms of point of origin other than one of those missiles was [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1044.3200000000002s)]
*  a ballistic missile that was taken down in the vicinity of Erbil that was en route toward Israel. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1048.96s)]
*  And that's all the information I have to provide. Louis. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1055.2s)]
*  QUESTION. Sir, yesterday the White House put out that – President Biden had made a congratulatory [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1058.0s)]
*  call to two Air Force units. Were those two units involved in the shootdown of [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1064.16s)]
*  these drones that you talked about earlier? MR. RHODES. Yes. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1072.72s)]
*  QUESTION. Were those units forward deployed in response – I mean, was this part of the [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1074.56s)]
*  movement of assets that we heard about last week and the possibility of an Iranian retaliatory attack? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1081.28s)]
*  MR. RHODES. We had deployed some additional fighter units into the – into the region, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1088.56s)]
*  but I'd have to refer you to CENTCOM whether or not those units were already in the AOR, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1095.12s)]
*  whether they were additional units that had been deployed in support of bolstering our efforts there. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1100.08s)]
*  Thank you. Yes, sir. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1107.52s)]
*  QUESTION. Thank you, sir. As far as these wars are concerned, finances are affected [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1109.0400000000002s)]
*  of the millions of people around the globe, and now many, many finance ministers are in town for [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1115.0400000000002s)]
*  the World Bank and I have a meeting. My question is that as far as this war is concerned, are we [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1120.0s)]
*  heading to a bigger war and maybe involving many other nations? And also, where do the UN, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1126.5600000000002s)]
*  United Nations, and the NATO stands as far as these conflicts are concerned? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1134.72s)]
*  MR. RHODES. Yeah, for NATO and the UN, as I'm sure you can appreciate, I'd refer you to them. I'm [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1139.04s)]
*  not going to speak for them. And look, from a U.S. Department of Defense standpoint, one of the [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1143.2s)]
*  things we come to work every day working hard to do is to prevent broader regional or global conflict [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1147.44s)]
*  as evidenced by our efforts in the Middle East region, and we're going to continue to stay very [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1154.8799999999999s)]
*  focused on that. Let me go to the phone here. Chris Gordon. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1159.2s)]
*  QUESTION. Thanks, Pat. Was the location of the U.S. aircraft – and I'm not asking you to say [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1162.1599999999999s)]
*  where the aircraft were – coordinated with allies, and I'm not asking you to name which allies [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1168.08s)]
*  in terms of where to operate to be best prepared to defend against this attack? And roughly how [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1173.1999999999998s)]
*  long did this engagement go on with U.S. assets defending Israel? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1179.9199999999998s)]
*  MR. RHODES. Yeah, thanks, Chris. In terms of the duration, I think, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1185.04s)]
*  you know, as you probably saw, most real time in social media, it – you know, we were looking over [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1190.24s)]
*  probably several hours here that this occurred, as I mentioned to my topper, you know, the evening [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1197.8400000000001s)]
*  of 13 April into the morning of 14 April. As it relates to the positioning of U.S. forces [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1204.88s)]
*  in the region, as you highlighted in your question, I'm not going to go into the specifics in terms of [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1212.24s)]
*  where those forces are based. But just as a matter of course, not only in central command, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1217.28s)]
*  but in any command, one of the things that we're constantly looking at is force posture, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1223.04s)]
*  force presence, to be able to address the most likely threats, to be able to be prepared to [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1227.84s)]
*  respond to a range of contingencies. And this was no different in this case. And so, obviously, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1234.6399999999999s)]
*  a lot of planning and coordination that goes into ensuring that we're ready to respond. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1241.52s)]
*  And I think the results speak for themselves as what you saw this weekend, Jennifer. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1247.52s)]
*  Q A senior defense official had said that 50 percent of Iran's missiles failed en route. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1253.04s)]
*  Was there sabotage involved in that, or are they just very bad missiles? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1260.8799999999999s)]
*  MR. RHODES. Again, I've seen those reports. I don't have anything to provide from the podium. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1264.16s)]
*  You know, again, other than the fact that I think it's notable that 99 percent of the aerial threats [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1269.3600000000001s)]
*  that Iran launched toward Israel were taken down. Q I have a China-Russia question, if I may. The [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1276.8000000000002s)]
*  AP is reporting that about 90 percent of Russia's microelectronics are coming from China last year, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1283.6000000000001s)]
*  which Russia has used to make missiles and tanks, et cetera, et cetera, used in the war against [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1290.0s)]
*  Ukraine. Can you confirm that? What more can you tell us on that? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1293.6000000000001s)]
*  MR. MULLER. I can. You know, as you've probably seen, we have indications that the PRC is [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1296.96s)]
*  supporting Russia's war effort by helping to ramp up its defense production with significant [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1303.8400000000001s)]
*  quantities of machine tools, microelectronics, optics, UAV, cruise missile technology, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1310.0s)]
*  which Russia is using to make propellants for weapons. And so this support is actively [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1315.6000000000001s)]
*  enabling Russia's war in Ukraine and poses a significant threat to security, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1322.56s)]
*  international security. So just leave it there. Q 90 percent number, 90 percent of their [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1328.48s)]
*  microelectronics. Can you confirm that as well? Last year? MR. MULLER. I don't have that. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1333.76s)]
*  Q Will this be raised by Secretary Austin in his call tomorrow? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1336.72s)]
*  MR. MULLER. I don't have anything to announce at this point or read out. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1339.44s)]
*  Any other questions? Let me take one more from Fadi, who side? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1345.12s)]
*  Q Yeah, I mean, I asked you a question and you said – I mean, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1350.24s)]
*  Admiral Haggad said this today from the Israeli airbase in Negev, that there will be a response. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1354.32s)]
*  General Halevi said that very clearly. So your response to my question, was that because you [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1363.76s)]
*  haven't been notified? MR. MULLER. No, I apologize. But what you said was, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1370.0s)]
*  if they respond, will the U.S. do something? They've said that they intend to respond, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1375.2s)]
*  but to my knowledge, there has been no response. So I'm not going to talk about a hypothetical [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1383.52s)]
*  about what they may or may not do if something has not been done. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1388.08s)]
*  Q Okay. So in that – so if you acknowledge that they said that, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1392.32s)]
*  do you think these statements contribute to what this administration is trying to do in terms of [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1395.2s)]
*  the escalation in the Middle East? MR. MULLER. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1400.0s)]
*  Again, we are in regular contact with our Israeli partners to include over the weekend, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1403.28s)]
*  as you saw, U.S. and Israeli forces bat down this unprecedented Iranian strike. Certainly, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1411.6s)]
*  when it comes to any type of Israeli response – and again, I'm not going to speak for the Israelis [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1420.48s)]
*  – that is a decision for them to make in terms of what they do, if they do it, and how they do it. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1426.96s)]
*  But again, from a U.S. standpoint, we continue to make very clear that we don't seek a wider [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1432.72s)]
*  regional war and we'll continue to work towards that result. Yes, sir. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1440.0s)]
*  Q Thank you. Ukraine is saying they are running low on air defense interceptors. What is your [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1445.76s)]
*  current assessment? How long will it take till they run out, and what will be the impact when [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1450.24s)]
*  they run out? MR. MULLER. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1455.84s)]
*  Well, certainly, you heard General Kovolny's testimony recently talking about the situation [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1457.6s)]
*  in Ukraine, so I'd point you to those remarks. Look, it's a dire situation right now in Ukraine. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1464.32s)]
*  You've got Russian forces that are making some gains on the front line, and it's absolutely [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1470.8799999999999s)]
*  essential that we get Ukraine what they need to include air defense capabilities so that they can [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1476.96s)]
*  check Russian aggression, defend their territory, and ultimately take back their sovereign [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1482.4s)]
*  territory. So we're going to continue to work very hard towards that end. But the most important [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1488.24s)]
*  thing that could happen right now is that Congress passed the supplemental so that we can ensure [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1491.92s)]
*  Ukraine gets the volume and level of support that they need to sustain that fight. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1496.4s)]
*  Q Sorry. Are we talking weeks or months till the air defense interceptors run out? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1500.4s)]
*  MR. MULLER. Like, I'm not going to get into the specific timeline, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1504.96s)]
*  other than it's just urgent that we get them that capability. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1508.0s)]
*  Q Yeah. Can you confirm these reports that Secretary Austin specifically asked his [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1512.08s)]
*  Israeli counterpart to give him a heads-up in the event Israel does decide to launch an attack [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1517.1999999999998s)]
*  against Iran? MR. MULLER. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1522.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. As I highlighted in the top of my remarks, Secretary Austin did have the opportunity to [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1524.6399999999999s)]
*  discuss the successful combined operation by the U.S., Israel, and our coalition partners [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1530.8s)]
*  to defend Israel from these unprecedented attacks by Iran and its proxies. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1536.3999999999999s)]
*  When it comes to the operations themselves, he praised the extraordinary defensive measures [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1542.0s)]
*  and the strong cooperation that was undertaken to defeat these threats. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1549.6799999999998s)]
*  But beyond that, Mike, I'm going to have to refer you to my readouts. Thank you. Tony. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1553.84s)]
*  MR. MULLER. Speaking of strong cooperation, can you talk a little bit about what impact [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1557.6799999999998s)]
*  the Juniper Oak exercise last year – you actually announced from the podium the largest ever [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1562.3999999999999s)]
*  U.S.-Israeli exercise in air defense and command and control. What impact did that have a year later [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1568.32s)]
*  in terms of the operation over the weekend? MR. MULLER. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1574.0s)]
*  Yeah. So a couple things, Tony. So I alluded earlier to the importance of understanding how [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1576.6399999999999s)]
*  our ongoing efforts over many years to strengthen interoperability and coordination – you see the [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1585.04s)]
*  fruition of that over the weekend. But to your point, Juniper Oak – and for those [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1592.48s)]
*  that aren't tracking, it's a combined joint all-domain exercise that really works to improve our [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1600.08s)]
*  ability to work with Israel on land, air, sea, space, and cyberspace. And so it was notable that [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1605.84s)]
*  the exercise series included U.S. and Israeli command and control and air interdiction, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1612.8s)]
*  both of which were critical on defending Israel Saturday night. And just again, as a reminder, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1619.04s)]
*  this exercise took place in January of 2023 and included 6,400 personnel, 1,100 IDF personnel, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1627.36s)]
*  100 U.S. aircraft, six ships, live-fire exercise, 180,000 pounds of live munitions – just to give [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1634.56s)]
*  you a sense of the scale. And it's this kind of strategic cooperation and combined training that [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1641.84s)]
*  allows us to do what we did together on Saturday night. Joseph. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1647.12s)]
*  Q Can you talk about the drones, at least the ones that the U.S. took down, if they were unarmed or [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1651.76s)]
*  if they had any type of munitions attached to them? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1658.6399999999999s)]
*  MR. RHODES My understanding is these were one-way attack drones, so explosive drones. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1660.7199999999998s)]
*  Q And then, second, does DOD assess that Iran has more sophisticated weapons that it could deploy [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1666.4799999999998s)]
*  in the event of any other attack on Israel or similar? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1674.6399999999999s)]
*  MR. RHODES Iran has demonstrated the capability to launch significant threats in terms of their [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1677.36s)]
*  UAVs, ballistic missiles, cruise missiles. But I'm not going to be able to go into further details. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1685.6s)]
*  Let me go to Heather, U.S. and I. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1691.76s)]
*  MS. HARF Hi. Thank you so much. To go back to the attack on [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1694.0s)]
*  Saturday night, a senior military official said the aircraft came from land and sea. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1699.6s)]
*  I just want to see if you can confirm the sea aspect of that. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1704.6399999999999s)]
*  MR. RHODES That is correct. There were both land-based and sea-based aircraft, U.S. aircraft, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1707.12s)]
*  involved. And last question. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1716.32s)]
*  Q Yeah, if I can do a follow-up question to my previous one. There were some words at the [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1719.68s)]
*  State Department, not officials, obviously, about a potential coordination of the U.S. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1725.44s)]
*  in case of retaliation towards Iran from the Israel. So my question is, are the U.S. again [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1732.32s)]
*  ready to coordinate, as they did on Saturday, a support to the Israeli in case they need? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1740.48s)]
*  MR. MULLER Yeah. So again, kind of just taking a step back here. And just as a matter of course, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1747.52s)]
*  the U.S., to include the Department of Defense, we maintain a very robust [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1755.76s)]
*  set of relationships throughout the region and throughout the world. And we're going to continue [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1763.76s)]
*  to stay in close consultation with our allies and partners when it comes to threats in the [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1768.0s)]
*  Middle East region and beyond to, again, focus on regional security and stability. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1772.48s)]
*  You've seen that play out over the weekend, and that will continue to be the case going forward. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1778.64s)]
*  Thanks very much, everybody. Appreciate it. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86K3mF_oVts&t=1783.76s)]
