# Details on the Iranian strike on U.S. base at Al Udeid in Qatar
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0)
*  All right. And Courtney, we want to bring in CBS News Face the Nation moderator, Margaret Brennan, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=0.0s)]
*  who is on the phone with us right now. Margaret, I know you're talking with your diplomatic [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=4.24s)]
*  sources. What are you hearing? Well, at this moment, it appears that that attack [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  by Iran on Al Udaid Air Base in Qatar has been concluded, though we haven't yet [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=16.32s)]
*  heard that there won't be further attacks later. It seems like for this moment, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=25.04s)]
*  no reported death or injuries from the U.S. military. Sometimes, though, that takes time [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  to actually assess. But what we know is that the United States and Qatar were able to be in [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=36.96s)]
*  communication well in advance of the attack actually being launched to prepare for what was [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  about to come via these short and medium range ballistic missiles that the short and medium [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=49.44s)]
*  range missiles that the Pentagon announced were fired at what is the forward headquarters for [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=55.68s)]
*  all of the Middle East Central Command operations based there in that small emirate of Qatar. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=62.72s)]
*  So this is very much Iran hitting directly at the command that helped to execute the attack on their [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=68.24s)]
*  three nuclear sites that the United States carried out overnight Saturday into Sunday. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=77.04s)]
*  Now, this was calibrated. This point looks limited, but the United States is very much on alert for [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=82.56s)]
*  further potential risk to Americans. They have been warning Americans traveling abroad, in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=89.36000000000001s)]
*  particular in the region, to exercise an abundance of caution. There are certain things you can [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=93.92s)]
*  protect and anticipate, and that would be the category of attack we just saw in terms of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=101.28s)]
*  incoming missiles. There are the other lower level attacks that are harder to prevent against. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=107.04s)]
*  And so that is why Americans are being warned to exercise caution, be aware of their surroundings, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=112.48s)]
*  because America has entered this war that Israel launched on Iran just a few days ago. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=119.36s)]
*  Thank you. We want to bring in CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent Holly Williams, who is in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=125.83999999999999s)]
*  Iraq. Holly, what are you hearing? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  Hey there, Meg. Well, Iran state media reported a while ago that it had launched a missile [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=136.48s)]
*  operation called Annunciation of Victory or Blessings of Victory, depending on how you [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=141.68s)]
*  translate it, against U.S. bases in Iraq and Qatar. Now, we've had those strikes that were [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=146.48s)]
*  intercepted over the U.S. base in Qatar, but so far nothing that we have been able to confirm [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=152.56s)]
*  here in Iraq. There are around 2,500 U.S. troops here in Iraq. We're a few miles from one U.S. base. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=159.12s)]
*  There are others in the southwest of the country and also the capital, Baghdad. Now, this was not [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=165.36s)]
*  unexpected. Iran's foreign minister said yesterday that his country had to respond to those U.S. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=172.16s)]
*  airstrikes against Iran's nuclear facility. We spoke to one Middle Eastern security expert [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=178.32s)]
*  who agreed. He said that if Iran didn't respond, it risked looking weak and being humiliated in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=183.84s)]
*  the eyes of its rivals here in the Middle East, as well as its own people. U.S. forces in the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=189.6s)]
*  Middle East, and there are bases scattered across this region, along with around 40,000 troops. They [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  were already on high alert bracing for a possible Iranian retaliation. You heard that reporting just [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=199.84s)]
*  now from Margaret, that this may have been a kind of calibrated response, perhaps even a bit [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=206.48s)]
*  theatrical, performative. That's really interesting because one possibility here is that this was a [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=211.84s)]
*  kind of face-saving response for the Iranian regime, and we will now start to see diplomatic [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=216.72s)]
*  wheels start to turn, perhaps even an Iranian capitulation, and they curtail their nuclear [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=222.0s)]
*  program. That is clearly what President Trump has been hoping for. The other possibility, of course, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  is that this could potentially spiral out of control into a bigger regional war. We know that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  many countries here in the Middle East were deeply concerned by the U.S. strikes against Iran, even [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=239.12s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, Iran's arch rival. We assume that they are more concerned now. All right, Holly [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=244.0s)]
*  Williams for us in Iraq. Thank you so much. We want to bring in White House reporter Willie James [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=251.04s)]
*  Inman now. And Willie, how are lawmakers reacting? What are you hearing from the White House? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=255.84s)]
*  Hey there, Meg. Good to be with you. Well, the president on his schedule today had a 1 p.m. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=262.56s)]
*  meeting with his national security team. We haven't yet gotten word as to whether or not [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=267.52s)]
*  that has started or if the president moved that meeting to the Situation Room. We, of course, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=273.04s)]
*  know that the White House was bracing for this type of response from the Iranians. In fact, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=277.12s)]
*  the president warned in his remarks over the weekend when he announced this operation to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=281.76s)]
*  the American public or explained the reasons why he said that the United States would respond [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=288.4s)]
*  if Iran retaliated against U.S. interests in the region. We, of course, wait to hear from the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  president himself. He oftentimes will post his message on True Social. But we do know that the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=300.56s)]
*  U.S. and the Department of Defense have been monitoring this development as we see it play out [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=307.28s)]
*  on our screens there at this military base, this Air Force base in Qatar, that Gulf state hosting [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=312.88s)]
*  thousands of U.S. troops, a large air base and one of the largest, in fact, in the region. We, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=320.0s)]
*  of course, know that the U.S. has other assets in the region as well, including in Iraq, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=327.28s)]
*  as Holly mentioned, Syria. We wait to hear from the White House. We do know, as I mentioned, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=332.88s)]
*  that he has that national security meeting, perhaps huddling with officials and watching [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=339.2s)]
*  this play out in real time. But no word from the White House yet in terms of a reaction to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=344.47999999999996s)]
*  this response. But I will point out a defense official says that there were no U.S. casualties [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=351.28s)]
*  saying that this Al Udeid air base was attacked by Iranian missiles earlier today as we saw play [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=356.32s)]
*  out on our screen. But no U.S. casualties in that attack there in Qatar. And Willie, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=363.6s)]
*  what has the response been from Republicans versus Democrats? Yeah, well, we have seen [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=371.12s)]
*  this response to the president's attack play out for the most part, Republicans supporting the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=377.92s)]
*  president in this decision to attack Iran. We know, of course, that the president likely does not want [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  a prolonged conflict. In fact, his officials telegraphed as much over the weekend on Sunday, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=392.47999999999996s)]
*  hitting the airwaves saying that this was a targeted operation. And of course, now we're [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  seeing the Iranian response to that. Some top Democrats, Democratic leaders, including Hakeem [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  Jeffries, have essentially blasted the president for this. And something that Democrats have been [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=407.44s)]
*  warning about or are perhaps concerned about is getting into a prolonged conflict. We are seeing [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  that play out now, this Iranian response, although it appears to be a tempered response, not a [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=419.36s)]
*  wide ranging response in terms of attacking those U.S. interests in the region, but a mixed message, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  a mixed response coming from lawmakers here on Capitol Hill, at least in terms of the president's [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=432.24s)]
*  decision to get involved in this conflict there in the Middle East. And how concerned are they that [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=437.12s)]
*  other countries will now get involved and retaliate possibly against the U.S.? Yeah, that's certainly [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=442.32s)]
*  is a concern. Most of the focus here is on Iran. The president, though, talked about the potential [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=449.44s)]
*  of other nations providing nuclear weapons to Iran. It's unclear what more the president will say [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=458.56s)]
*  on that. But the large part of this, the large focus of this has been on Iran and its proxies [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=468.08s)]
*  in the region. We, of course, know the U.S. has allies in the region, including Qatar, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=475.12s)]
*  other nations that are closely aligned with the U.S. because they provide, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=479.52s)]
*  the U.S. government rather provides defense to those nations in the region. But nonetheless, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=483.76s)]
*  we have seen Iran really just decimated in terms of its military apparatus, its proxies in the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=490.88s)]
*  region, including Hezbollah and Hamas decimated in the region as well. So a weakened Iran, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=497.52s)]
*  as we've been talking about here on our air, responding at least a soft response, if you will, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=503.68s)]
*  in terms of this U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites over the past weekend. All right, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=511.84s)]
*  Willie James Inman at the White House for us. We will check back with you in a little bit. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=517.4399999999999s)]
*  CBS News intelligence and national security reporter Olivia Gazas joins us now from the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=521.92s)]
*  State Department. Olivia, do we know if or how Iran will retaliate against the U.S.? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=527.2s)]
*  Well, from indications right now are that this initial volley against U.S. interests in Qatar [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=534.96s)]
*  has concluded. We are still on high alert as to whether there will be additional strikes against [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=541.9200000000001s)]
*  locations of U.S. troops and diplomatic personnel in other countries in the region. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=547.6s)]
*  Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, none of those have given us the sort of all clear. And so it is still an [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=552.56s)]
*  open question as to whether this is the extent of Iran's retaliatory strikes or if this is just the [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=559.1999999999999s)]
*  beginning of them. Thus far, we understand via Margaret Brennan, who reported via diplomatic [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=564.64s)]
*  sources that the U.S. and Qatar had meetings this weekend. And this response vis-à-vis [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=570.2399999999999s)]
*  al-Udeid base in Qatar was expected and calibrated. This morning at 7 44 a.m. Eastern time, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=576.08s)]
*  the State Department did issue a shelter in place notification for American citizens in Qatar, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=582.96s)]
*  indicating at least that something was notified to the United States that something could happen [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=588.64s)]
*  involving that location. We are asking the question of whether there have been indirect or [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=595.84s)]
*  direct messages passed by the Iranians to the United States. We don't have a firm answer to [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=600.8s)]
*  that yet. But if this is as contained as it has been, if it is the case that there are no U.S. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=605.44s)]
*  casualties, it is an important indication that Iran has done what it needs to do in order to [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=611.6s)]
*  save face and that is reopening the door to a diplomatic solution. But again, we still need [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=617.12s)]
*  to stand by and determine whether this is the extent of the retaliation or not. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=622.5600000000001s)]
*  Olivia, we know that you have reported, Holly has reported, Margaret has reported that this was not [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=629.04s)]
*  a surprise. I think a lot of people now are wondering how quickly could we see another [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=634.0s)]
*  attack come in terms of a timeline? It's unclear, right? It all goes down to the Iranian intention [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=638.3199999999999s)]
*  and that's what U.S. intelligence agencies and diplomats are scrambling to understand right now. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=646.8s)]
*  Is this all that Iran plans to do? And if so, what are the plans? And what are the plans? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=651.28s)]
*  What are the next steps to do? And if so, what are the next steps from here? The fact that there [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=656.48s)]
*  are no casualties, the fact that these are strictly military targets are an important [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=660.72s)]
*  indication that Iran does not at this stage wish to escalate its fight with the United States. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=664.48s)]
*  It would be different if it were targeting civilian targets. It would be different if it [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=670.5600000000001s)]
*  were targeting Americans in a number of Arab countries in the region, which was a concern [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=674.16s)]
*  in the immediate aftermath of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=682.08s)]
*  So time will tell whether this is an opening volley or the extent of the response. We knew [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=687.9200000000001s)]
*  something had to come. We knew that the Supreme Leader and Iranian officials were signaling that [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=694.1600000000001s)]
*  a response would come, but we were all waiting to understand what would be targeted and whether [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=700.08s)]
*  civilian casualties, American casualties would result because that would be determinative of the [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=708.56s)]
*  United States response from here. All right, Olivia, thank you so much. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=714.4799999999999s)]
*  Let's bring in Andrew Voigt, former director of CIA Center for Cyber Intelligence. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=719.04s)]
*  First of all, what are you watching and who are you talking to right now? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=725.28s)]
*  I think Olivia and Margaret have it right. We have to determine what the Iranian intentions are. Is [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=730.4799999999999s)]
*  it a limited strike so that we could get back to a point of negotiations, or is this just the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=736.24s)]
*  opening volley of a retaliation? Earlier today, I spoke to your colleagues about the potential of [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=742.0s)]
*  cyber retaliation against U.S. networks inside the continental U.S. I still think that's a possibility, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=748.48s)]
*  but again, that would be a result in more of a nuisance for Americans than anything definitive, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=755.28s)]
*  such as casualties at our bases in the Gulf. I still don't think anybody can really make a [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=760.8s)]
*  conclusion unless something has been communicated to the administration that we're not aware of, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=767.52s)]
*  that this is the end of it. I hope for the safety of our troops that it is. There is still also the [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=771.76s)]
*  possibility in addition to cyber attacks that the Iranians attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz to [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=777.5999999999999s)]
*  shipping, which would obviously also be an escalation which would have severe economic [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=783.04s)]
*  impact in the region, and I think the United States would have to respond in that case. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=788.08s)]
*  What else are you watching for right now? We keep hearing that there could be another [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=793.2800000000001s)]
*  attack very soon in terms of a timeline. Is there any way to kind of look at that? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=800.88s)]
*  Well, we have 10,000 various military personnel at Al-Adid Air Base in Qatar and near Doha. We [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=807.44s)]
*  have other bases in the region. Could the Iranians use Iraqi Shia proxies to attack some of our bases [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=816.96s)]
*  in Syria, in eastern Syria, or our personnel at embassies around the region? That is what I would [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=824.0s)]
*  be watching. I think both the U.S. military and the U.S. State Department in the field are taking [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=830.0s)]
*  precautions and protecting our people, but if the Iranians are really determined, they could [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=836.32s)]
*  cause U.S. casualties at a number of these locations, and I think we'll be following that [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=841.0400000000001s)]
*  for the next 24 hours at least. What does this mean for Americans that are in the region right now? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=845.92s)]
*  So I think our diplomatic personnel, our U.S. personnel, have protective measures and ways to [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=853.4399999999999s)]
*  defend themselves. What I do worry about is we have a fairly large business footprint. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=861.12s)]
*  American citizens who work across the Persian Gulf region, the Arab Gulf region, I'm worried [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=867.1999999999999s)]
*  their safety because they don't have those defensive measures that some of our government [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=874.96s)]
*  folks do. Is the U.S. prepared for extensive evacuations? We're always prepared for evacuations [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=878.5600000000001s)]
*  as necessary of diplomatic families, U.S. military families. I don't think we'd actually evacuate [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=887.2s)]
*  our combat forces because they have to be prepared to defend Americans or to conduct other strikes [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=894.0s)]
*  on Iran. I think we are prepared for that, but what level of execution on those preparations we [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=901.4399999999999s)]
*  have to do I think will be seen in the next several hours. All right, Andrew Boyd, thank you so much. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=907.3599999999999s)]
*  So CBS News congressional correspondent Nicole Killian is on Capitol Hill. Nicole, tell me, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=913.68s)]
*  what are you hearing from lawmakers? What are their reactions? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=920.88s)]
*  Yeah, well keep in mind that lawmakers are just returning here to Capitol Hill [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=924.64s)]
*  following the Juneteenth holiday and a brief recess, but we did hear a moment ago from speaker [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=929.12s)]
*  Mike Johnson who spoke with reporters. He said that he did receive a classified briefing earlier [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=935.12s)]
*  this morning about the potential for retaliatory attacks. He also said, you know, that so far [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=942.8s)]
*  these are some that this is the retaliation that was expected so far, so good, no casualties so far [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=952.8s)]
*  and he also goes on to say I know that the national security team is in the situation room as we [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=959.36s)]
*  speak. So that coming from speaker Johnson just moments ago, he also, it appears that he was asked [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=964.72s)]
*  about, you know, there are several war powers resolutions that are being proposed by members [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=971.52s)]
*  of Congress both in the House and the Senate, so he did tell reporters that he does not think [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=976.48s)]
*  that that is necessary or that this is an appropriate time to try to hold a vote [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=981.36s)]
*  on something like this. Of course, this is a concern that many members have about the U.S. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=986.16s)]
*  being potentially dragged into further conflict in the Middle East. Some lawmakers believe that [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=990.56s)]
*  Congress should have been briefed ahead of that initial strike by the United States that was [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=997.1999999999999s)]
*  ordered by President Trump on Saturday, so as I mentioned, you know, there are various proposals [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=1001.4399999999999s)]
*  floating. In fact, House Democrats are also drafting yet another war powers resolution that [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=1006.88s)]
*  we could see at some point this week, basically again trying to claw back some of those powers [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=1012.16s)]
*  that Congress has in terms of a declaration of war. There's a lot of semantics with respect to [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=1019.1999999999999s)]
*  that in the sense that, you know, some lawmakers see this as a targeted strike, which is why they [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=1023.92s)]
*  are standing by the president, but there are others, many Democrats in particular, who believe that, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=1028.8799999999999s)]
*  you know, the president has gone too far with his action, so we will continue to keep you posted on [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=1035.2s)]
*  reaction as we get it. We should be hearing from the Democratic leader in the House, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=1041.44s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries, a minority leader shortly, where we could hear more from him as well, but he has [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=1046.3200000000002s)]
*  already expressed his concern about the president's actions as saying that the president bears [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=1051.2s)]
*  responsibility for anything really that comes from this initial strike on Saturday, so again, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=1056.56s)]
*  we will see what more the leader has to say later today. All right, Nicole Killian-Forest, thank you [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=1064.64s)]
*  so much. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRJ8E6unn0&t=1069.36s)]
