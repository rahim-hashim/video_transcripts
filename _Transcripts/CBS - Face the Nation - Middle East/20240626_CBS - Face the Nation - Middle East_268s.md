# How Jamaal Bowman's loss in New York primary highlights Democrats' divide over Israel
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw)
*  So Tuesday was a busy night for primaries and yeah, we saw an upset in the most expensive house primary in American history [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=0.0s)]
*  in New York's 16th district the Democratic primary there [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=7.12s)]
*  incumbent progressive congressman Jamal Bowman lost to Westchester County executive George Latimer [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=11.72s)]
*  That is a race that highlighted the party's deep divide over Israel [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=17.36s)]
*  CBS News congressional correspondent Nicole Killian joins us from Capitol Hill with more on this Nicole [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=21.8s)]
*  How significant in your view is the result of that race and what was the political impact of? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=27.54s)]
*  Israel and what did it have to do with it? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=35.1s)]
*  Well, it's significant in the sense that this is the first time we've seen a member of the so-called squad [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=37.62s)]
*  in essence knocked off by a challenger and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=43.82s)]
*  Interestingly, it was Jamal Bowman who knocked off an incumbent about four years ago [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=48.18s)]
*  But now kind of finding himself in the same predicament where he has been voted out as a result of this [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=52.7s)]
*  Primary, but look he told me ahead of this a primary race, you know that he stands by his position [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=60.1s)]
*  You know [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=66.06s)]
*  He is someone who called for a permanent ceasefire someone who opposes military US military [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=66.7s)]
*  Assistance going to Israel and he stood by those positions and said well, yes [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=72.5s)]
*  You know we have to condemn what happened on October 7th on the same token [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=76.42s)]
*  You also have to do more and be concerned about the plight of the Palestinians George Latimer for his part [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=80.78s)]
*  I also told me that he feels that his position was kind of more [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=86.74000000000001s)]
*  In alignment with the Democratic Party as a whole and that now that of course he has won this primary that he looks forward [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=90.10000000000001s)]
*  To working with Democratic officials, even those who didn't support him like minority leader Hakeem Jeffries [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=98.02000000000001s)]
*  Another topic Nicole Republican congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna says she will move forward to force a vote on holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=105.14s)]
*  Contempt what's new on that front? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=113.78s)]
*  Well, this is yet another attempt on the part of House Republicans to go after the Attorney General [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  Of course that we know earlier this month the house did vote to hold the Attorney General in contempt of Congress for defying a congressional [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=121.94s)]
*  Ultimately the Justice Department though said that it is not going to prosecute it boss the Attorney General [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=128.89999999999998s)]
*  This was all over those recordings between special counsel Robert her and President Biden which were protected by executive privilege [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=134.61999999999998s)]
*  So that's why the Department of Justice declined to take action, but House Republicans say they still want those tapes [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=141.73999999999998s)]
*  So this inherent contempt is kind of an archaic [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=147.17999999999998s)]
*  You know mechanism that basically would require the sergeant in arms like literally to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=151.45999999999998s)]
*  Arrest the Attorney General bring him before the chamber something that hasn't been [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=157.22s)]
*  Utilized in over a hundred years right now though [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=162.18s)]
*  It's unclear if they're the votes for that even though speaker Johnson seems amenable to eventually potentially bringing this to the floor [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=165.72s)]
*  Think we've got some sound from the congresswoman. Can we listen to that? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=176.38s)]
*  What Garland could do and the right thing to do would be for him to present himself to the House of Representatives [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  I think this idea and the hypothetical that he's hoping for in which the sergeant at arms would go pull him into custody [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=186.18s)]
*  If we pass this and it's successful [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=193.26000000000002s)]
*  We will direct the speaker to call the sergeant arms of which they do have the authority [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=195.26000000000002s)]
*  Under this inherent contempt emotion to bring him into custody [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=199.22000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, butting up all that you had to say then Nicole a final topic [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=202.74s)]
*  I want to squeeze in before we run out of time [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=205.98000000000002s)]
*  We've got some celebrity appearances on the hill including some reality TV stars and country music icons. What can you tell us about that? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=207.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's right [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=215.42000000000002s)]
*  And we're there have been no sort of shortage of celebrity sightings here on Capitol Hill recently between 50 cent and usher now [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  We have Paris Hilton and Randy Travis on the hill [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=223.10000000000002s)]
*  but Paris Hilton she has actually come to the hill many times before really advocating on the issue of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=225.5s)]
*  Combating child abuse and strengthening child welfare that is something that she testified about this morning before the House Ways and Means Committee [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=232.06s)]
*  Also later today we'll hear from country music star Randy Travis who suffered a stroke about a decade ago [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=239.46s)]
*  But will advocate for music artists to be paid royalties by AM and FM stations [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=245.22s)]
*  When their songs are played on the radio, there's some legislation to do just that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=252.14s)]
*  So he will be testifying in favor of that alongside his wife later today. All right, well Nicole Killian. You are our star [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=256.42s)]
*  Thanks for being across it all today. Appreciate it. You bet [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYC9-7e6hw&t=263.58s)]
