# Jake Sullivan says White House has been in touch with hostage's family after video released
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [December 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0)
*  We are joined now by President Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=0.0s)]
*  He is in Newcastle, New Hampshire this morning. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=4.48s)]
*  Jake, good morning. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  The Hamas video release of Edan Alexander. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  I know the administration regards it as a cruel, propagandistic maneuver, but do you [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=11.92s)]
*  detect anything tactical at all in the timing of the release of this video, Jake? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=17.54s)]
*  Well, Major, first, thanks for having me. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=23.68s)]
*  As far as this video, it is a cruel reminder of the barbarity and the brutality of Hamas, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=26.96s)]
*  holding so many innocent people hostage, including Americans, including Edan. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=33.88s)]
*  We were in touch with Edan's family yesterday. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  I'll be talking to the families of all of the American hostages, including Edan's family, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=41.88s)]
*  this week. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=46.8s)]
*  I do think that Hamas is feeling the pressure. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=47.88s)]
*  They're feeling the pressure because one of their main partners in crime here, Hezbollah, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  has now cut a ceasefire deal, and they thought that Hezbollah would be with them till the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=54.6s)]
*  end. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=59.08s)]
*  They're feeling the pressure, of course, because their top leader, Sinwar, has been killed. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=60.08s)]
*  So they may be looking anew at the possibility of getting a ceasefire and hostage deal, and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=63.92s)]
*  we are working actively with all of the key players in the region, including Israel and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=68.84s)]
*  Turkey and Qatar and Egypt, to try to bring that about. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=73.48s)]
*  The fate of the hostages, of course, on the administration's mind, on the minds of all [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=77.4s)]
*  Americans and all in the region, but also, Jake, I'm sure you saw over the last couple [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=81.7s)]
*  of days the video from Gaza of Palestinians surging to try to get a loaf of bread, in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=85.7s)]
*  some cases crushing one another unintentionally. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=93.06s)]
*  All suggestions are that the humanitarian situation there is, if it already isn't past [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=97.3s)]
*  crisis stage, near famine crisis stage, how much does that intensify the need to get this [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=103.94s)]
*  thing across, as you just said, the finish line? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=111.06s)]
*  The humanitarian situation in Gaza is a crisis. You have too many people who are suffering [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=114.38s)]
*  from shortages of food, water, medicine, access to sanitation, innocent people who deserve [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=120.6s)]
*  a measure of peace and deserve access to all of those lifesaving supplies in abundance. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=128.2s)]
*  The United States has been working week in, week out, month in, month out to open crossings, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=133.92s)]
*  to move trucks, to ensure that humanitarian aid gets in, and at critical moments we have [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=139.28s)]
*  been able to intervene in ways that have staved off the worst case scenarios of famine. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  But it's constantly stalking Gaza, and so more needs to be done to get aid in. Now, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  part of the problem, as we've seen just in the last 24 hours, is not actually moving [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=156.04s)]
*  aid from outside Gaza into Gaza, but moving it around Gaza once it's inside. The UN, in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  fact, said it was suspending movement from certain areas of Gaza because of concerns [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=166.92s)]
*  about looting. These are all things that would be helped if there were a ceasefire in place. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=171.76s)]
*  Jake, is the probability of a ceasefire enhanced or undercut when someone such as South Carolina [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=177.44s)]
*  Senator Lindsey Graham says President-elect Trump wants a ceasefire before inauguration [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=184.92s)]
*  deal? Does that help you or hurt you? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=189.32s)]
*  Look, I think the key actor right now holding the decision on the ceasefire is Hamas. And [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=191.84s)]
*  the key thing motivating Hamas is not American politics or the American presidential transition. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=198.44s)]
*  It's their determination about whether or not it makes sense for them at this point [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=204.96s)]
*  after Hezbollah has abandoned them, after their leader has been killed, after their [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=210.44000000000003s)]
*  military formations have been degraded to finally say yes to a ceasefire and hostage [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=214.24s)]
*  deal. That's going to be the telling thing more than anything that's said back here. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=218.84s)]
*  But I will say this. There has been very good coordination between our team and the incoming [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=222.74s)]
*  team on all of the aspects of the crisis in the Middle East. We felt it was important [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=227.38000000000002s)]
*  that we be in touch with them to keep them up to speed on what's happening because this [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=232.56s)]
*  handoff has got to be smooth. And they in turn have reciprocated by being open and transparent [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  and working with us. This is how it should be in a transition. This is what we're going [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  to keep driving for for every day that we have left in office. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=246.0s)]
*  Jake, I want to have a conversation with you about leverage as regards the Israeli government. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  I want to play for you something that Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen said on [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=253.44s)]
*  this program a week ago. Let's listen. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=257.32s)]
*  We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=260.0s)]
*  only to be ignored or slapped down entirely. And then President Biden sends more bombs [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=265.26s)]
*  and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=270.82s)]
*  Your response? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=275.62s)]
*  First of all, I respect Senator Van Hollen. He knows these issues as well as any person [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=278.1s)]
*  in Washington, and he is passionate about them. But of course, we have a different perspective. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=284.18s)]
*  We have at various points over the course of this conflict made asks of the Israelis [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=289.24s)]
*  consistent with our values and our interests. Have we gotten everything we've asked for? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=293.32000000000005s)]
*  No. Have we seen a change in Israeli behavior with respect to the movement of humanitarian [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=297.56s)]
*  assistance, with respect to how they conducted certain military operations, including in [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  places like Ra'afa? Yes, we have. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=307.72s)]
*  And so we do believe that we've had a constructive engagement with the Israeli government and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=310.48s)]
*  also been able to make a difference on the ground with respect to the flow of humanitarian [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=315.12s)]
*  aid. In addition, we worked closely with the Israeli government to bring about a ceasefire [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=320.72s)]
*  in Lebanon, a ceasefire, people said, wasn't possible until a new administration took office. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=326.36s)]
*  Jake, I want to turn your attention to Ukraine, where the Ukrainian president, Vladimir Zelensky, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=332.88000000000005s)]
*  appeared to indicate in a recent interview that he could possibly be open to a peace [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  settlement in which Russia retains the territory it has. Ukraine, meaning Kiev, keeps all the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=344.64s)]
*  rest if that is swiftly brought under the umbrella of NATO. Is that the outline or the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=351.8s)]
*  contours of something you believe or the administration believes could be workable? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=356.56s)]
*  Well, Major, I'm sorry to disappoint you. I can't negotiate in public on your program, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  and I certainly can't negotiate on behalf of President Zelensky, who really should speak [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=366.4s)]
*  for himself when it comes to the destiny of his country. The future of Ukraine should be determined [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=370.96s)]
*  at the negotiating table by decisions of the Ukrainians, not imposed from the outside by the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=376.32s)]
*  United States or anybody else. I will say, though, that we have been engaging with Ukrainians over [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=382.23999999999995s)]
*  the course of this year on how you marry the support we provided them for use on the battlefield [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  with a diplomatic strategy for the negotiating table. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  And some recent decisions from the administration have been criticized by Republicans as setting [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=396.91999999999996s)]
*  the situation on fire, meaning attack them and anti-personnel mines. Those advocates [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=400.8s)]
*  for Ukraine say those decisions are way too late to change the battle space in any strategically [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=406.24s)]
*  important way. What do you come down? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=411.36s)]
*  Anti-personnel land mines, which are non-persistent mines that shut off after two weeks so they [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=413.48s)]
*  don't represent a long-term threat to civilians. These could be helpful against the particular [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  type of tactics that the Russian infantry is using right now in eastern Ukraine. So [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=424.08000000000004s)]
*  he's sending them. The A-TACOM's permission into Russian territory, that was a decision [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=429.36s)]
*  he took after Russia escalated by introducing North Korean troops into this war, a foreign [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=435.36s)]
*  army into this war. So that was a responsible, coordinated step that we took with other allies [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=441.2s)]
*  to respond to that provocation, to that escalation by Russia. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=448.56s)]
*  The president has been clear all along, we are going to give Ukraine the tools it needs. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=452.48s)]
*  We are also going to do what we can to put them in the best possible position on the battlefield, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=456.8s)]
*  so they'll be in the best possible position at the negotiating table, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=461.20000000000005s)]
*  and then that this war will ultimately end in diplomacy. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, thanks so much for your time. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHTWQOAFN0&t=468.56s)]
