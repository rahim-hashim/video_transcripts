# Trump still working to end Israel-Hamas, Russia-Ukraine conflicts
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8)
*  Throughout the campaign, President Trump repeatedly said he could end the wars in Ukraine and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=0.0s)]
*  Gaza with blazing speed, even claiming the war in Ukraine would be over before he officially [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  took office. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=9.9s)]
*  But of course, those conflicts are still happening, and the president has since said he made those [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=10.9s)]
*  comments in jest. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=15.6s)]
*  Talks between Ukraine and Russia have yet to lead to a permanent ceasefire, and in the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=17.56s)]
*  Middle East, a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has fallen apart, even with [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=21.2s)]
*  59 hostages still in Gaza. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=26.32s)]
*  Many of them are feared to be dead. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=28.44s)]
*  CBS News' senior national security correspondent Charlie Daggett joins us now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  Charlie, let's start with Ukraine. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=33.52s)]
*  How would you describe President Trump's approach to this conflict and how much progress [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=34.52s)]
*  has been made since he was inaugurated? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=39.0s)]
*  In terms of his approach, contradictory and unpredictable is how I would probably describe [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=41.68s)]
*  it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  You know, he started out—well, he said that it was more difficult than he'd anticipated. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  You know, we know he has argued with President Zelensky in that blowup at the White House. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=52.72s)]
*  He's alienated many European allies and NATO who are crucial to this fight. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=56.92s)]
*  At first, a lot of people are concerned he's making too many concessions to President Putin. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  But then, it's all changed again. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=65.44s)]
*  In the past week, he hardened his language against Putin and Russia, especially after [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=67.64s)]
*  the heaviest Russian bombardment that Ukraine's seen in almost a year last week. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  Having said that, some progress has been made in recent days. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=77.56s)]
*  President Putin announcing at least a temporary ceasefire next month to March Victory Day. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=80.72s)]
*  Positive statements from President Trump after a brief meeting with President Zelensky at [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  the Vatican over the weekend. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  Maybe even a breakthrough on a minerals deal with Ukraine. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=91.04s)]
*  And that was after Stephen Witkoff met with Putin. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=93.84s)]
*  Trump says Ukraine and Russia are very close to a deal. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=98.92s)]
*  Now, both sides know they need to make concessions. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=102.2s)]
*  Both know that they've been put on notice by the secretary of state and others who have [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  said that this week is going to be pivotal. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=109.2s)]
*  Some days that—in the early days, it looked like they might have had some sort of breakthrough, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=142.16000000000003s)]
*  right? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=147.88000000000002s)]
*  There was a hope that the initial ceasefire might lead to something more permanent. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  And talks have been continuing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  I checked again on that, largely driven by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  You know, but one of the main sticking points is, as it ever was, Israel is demanding that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  Hamas completely dismantle and give up rule, and that the release of the 59 hostages that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=163.4s)]
*  remain there—probably half of them are still alive—would happen without conditions. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=168.38s)]
*  But Israel's objective from the start of this war was not to defeat Hamas, but the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=173.85999999999999s)]
*  complete destruction of Hamas. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  Roughly 2,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire failed. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=179.9s)]
*  The United States, largely driven again by envoy Stephen Witkoff, had been trying to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=186.46s)]
*  break the negotiating stalemate, but with little success, while the war rages. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=191.22s)]
*  I have to remind people. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=195.74s)]
*  The death toll currently stands at more than 41,000—excuse me, 51,300 people in Gaza. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=197.14s)]
*  At least 17,000 of those are children, according to Palestinian authorities. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=202.7s)]
*  Charley Nagada, thank you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=206.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c79ufsYSx8&t=208.7s)]
