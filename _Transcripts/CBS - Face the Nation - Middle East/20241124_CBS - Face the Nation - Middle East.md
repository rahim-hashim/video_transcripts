# Sen. Van Hollen says Biden is "not fully complying with American law" on Israeli arms shipments
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [November 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4)
*  We're now joined by Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=0.0s)]
*  Holland. Good to have you here. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=2.72s)]
*  It's great to be with you, Margaret. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=4.04s)]
*  So in these final days of Democratic control, the Senate [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=5.54s)]
*  and the White House is a long to do list. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=8.24s)]
*  Congress has to fund the government by end of December, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=10.82s)]
*  pass the defense bill, the NDAA, an extension to the farm bill. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=13.4s)]
*  And I know Democrats want to confirm as many judges as [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=17.32s)]
*  possible. What's top of your list? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=20.56s)]
*  Well, all of those are on the list. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Top of my list is also the disaster relief funding, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  emergency relief. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=28.68s)]
*  We had big parts of the country hit by hurricanes and other [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=30.08s)]
*  natural disasters. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=33.24s)]
*  In my state of Maryland, we had the collapse of the Key Bridge [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=34.92s)]
*  in Baltimore. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=38.04s)]
*  So we've always taken the approach that the whole country [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=39.24s)]
*  will be there to help fellow Americans in need. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=42.38s)]
*  The president has now submitted a hundred billion dollar [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=45.44s)]
*  emergency disaster relief plan that includes funding for the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=48.54s)]
*  Key Bridge. So I hope that we will get that done by the end [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=51.72s)]
*  of the year. People need that relief and they need it now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=55.9s)]
*  That's about eight billion for the bridge alone. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=59.06s)]
*  Is that right? Not for the bridge alone. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=61.22s)]
*  This that's part of the emergency relief fund that includes [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=62.5s)]
*  approximately two billion for the bridge. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=65.42s)]
*  And you're relatively confident that this can be delivered on? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=68.1s)]
*  I hope that all of our colleagues, Republicans and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=71.22s)]
*  Democrats alike, will support disaster relief. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  We've always had the philosophy all for one and one for all. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=76.34s)]
*  When Americans get hit by these disasters, I hope we will stick [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=80.02s)]
*  with that position. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=82.84s)]
*  Well, we also are looking at a new Congress very soon and, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  as you know, a new commander in chief. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=88.92s)]
*  Republicans will have the majority in the Senate with 53 [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=91.72s)]
*  seats. So they don't really need Democratic votes to confirm many [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=95.12s)]
*  of the picks that Mr. Trump has been making to run agencies. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=98.28s)]
*  But from what you've seen today, are you in favor of any of them? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=102.44s)]
*  Your colleague Marco Rubio, as secretary of state, for example, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=106.4s)]
*  or this new choice to be labor secretary? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=109.56s)]
*  Look, my view is this is what the vetting process is all about. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=112.92s)]
*  The hearing process, the Senate, of course, under the Constitution, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  has the job of advising and consenting on nominations. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  And I take that responsibility very seriously. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=124.56s)]
*  I've been troubled by some talk that the president-elect Trump [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=127.64s)]
*  wants to short circuit that constitutional approach using this [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  recess appointment device. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  And it will be really important that the new Republican leader in the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=137.12s)]
*  Senate uphold the Senate's prerogatives under the Constitution [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=140.32s)]
*  and not try to do an end run. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=144.6s)]
*  Well, stay tuned to see how that plays out. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=146.72s)]
*  Let's turn to the Middle East. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=150.16s)]
*  You said that President Biden's inaction [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=151.48s)]
*  to halt the horrific humanitarian situation inside of Gaza [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=155.44s)]
*  is a stain on his administration that it's shameful. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=159.88s)]
*  Is there anything in these final weeks that could be done to erase that stain? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  I think there are things that can be done. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=169.44s)]
*  And I should emphasize that I supported President Biden's decision [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  to travel to Israel in the aftermath of the brutal Hamas attacks [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=174.76s)]
*  of October 7th of last year and stand with the people of Israel [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  as they confront this threat. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=182.83999999999997s)]
*  But I also wish the president had effectively used U.S. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=185.44s)]
*  leverage to essentially assert his own positions. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=194.2s)]
*  of Prime Minister Netanyahu only to be ignored or slapped down entirely. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=198.04s)]
*  And then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=202.84s)]
*  That is not an effective use of leverage. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  So I do hope in these closing months, the president will finally make [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=209.2s)]
*  more effective use of American leverage to at the very least uphold American law [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  to insist that the Netanyahu government allows humanitarian aid into Gaza [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=219.48s)]
*  and that they use our weapons in a manner consistent with the laws of war. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=224.52s)]
*  So you take a nuanced and specific stand on that upholding U.S. law. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=228.60000000000002s)]
*  This is often characterized, though, as being for or against helping Israel. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=233.32000000000002s)]
*  There were 19 senators. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=238.4s)]
*  You were one of them who voted this past week to pause specific shipments [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  on three different groups of weapons, offensive weapons to Israel. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=243.08s)]
*  You said the state department's reviewing 500 incidents [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=247.60000000000002s)]
*  where U.S. weapons were used and caused unnecessary civilian harm. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=250.84s)]
*  The State Department has said Israel's doing things to fix the situation, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=255.72s)]
*  which is why weapons continue to be greenlit. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  Are you suggesting that's a lie? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=262.36s)]
*  I'm suggesting that the president of the United States is not fully complying [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=265.08000000000004s)]
*  with American law on this question. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=269.8s)]
*  If you look at the letter that was sent by Secretaries Austin and Secretary Blinken [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=272.48s)]
*  to Israeli authorities in October, you look at that final paragraph, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=277.2s)]
*  you'll see that they're complaining about the fact that there is no effective [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=281.4s)]
*  mechanism right now for getting to the bottom of claims of civilian harm. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  The State Department has, as I said, about 500, as you said, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=289.84s)]
*  and we haven't gotten to the bottom of those. Why? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=293.88s)]
*  Because the process is broken. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  And I would argue that there's not been the will to fix the process [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=299.52s)]
*  because a lot of people don't want the process to produce the obvious answer, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=304.6s)]
*  which is there have been many cases where we've seen U.S. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=309.8s)]
*  weapons used in violation of international humanitarian law. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=313.24s)]
*  In fact, if you go back to the NSM 20 report earlier this year, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=316.12s)]
*  the Biden administration said specifically that there was a high likelihood [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  that U.S. weapons were being used in violation of international law. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=324.88s)]
*  And yet they've done nothing in intervening period to enforce that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=328.92s)]
*  When I pressed U.S. officials on this privately, they've said, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=332.88000000000005s)]
*  what do you want us to do? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  You want us to put in a halt for a few weeks and then Donald Trump reverses it? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=337.0s)]
*  What's the point? How do you respond to that? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=340.56s)]
*  Well, the point is, they should have been doing this for a much longer period of time. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  The president had ample opportunities over the last year. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=346.76000000000005s)]
*  There are many people in the administration, senior level, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  at the senior level, who told me that this war was going to come to an end back in January. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=352.68s)]
*  You know, I've met with hostage families on numerous occasions [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=358.20000000000005s)]
*  who have been calling out Prime Minister Netanyahu for not agreeing to a ceasefire [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=362.0s)]
*  and a return of their loved ones. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=367.44s)]
*  Minister Golan, the defense minister of Israel, was fired [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=369.64s)]
*  because he wanted to prioritize the return of hostages. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=372.48s)]
*  And yet President Biden has never called out Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=375.6s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=379.96s)]
*  for his obstruction on this, even though those families I've met with are calling him out. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=380.36s)]
*  Even post-election, why do you think he won't do that? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=385.08s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=388.12s)]
*  I just don't know why the president of the United States has not been willing [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  to make more effective use of American leverage to assert his own stated objectives. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, he's been ignored on other things, too, right? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=400.8s)]
*  He wants the PA to be the nucleus of governance in a post-war Gaza. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=402.8s)]
*  He wants a two-state solution. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=407.68s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu has not only ignored those, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=409.92s)]
*  he's gone out there and bragged about how he's blocking President Biden's efforts. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=413.24s)]
*  And yet the blank check just keeps on coming. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=419.72s)]
*  So what my colleagues and I are saying is, let's just pause these transfers [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=422.8s)]
*  of offensive weapons, certain ones, until the Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XYb76NcL4&t=429.20000000000005s)]
