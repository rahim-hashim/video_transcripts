# Timeline of events of the war after Hamas' attack on Israel 1 year ago
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI)
*  Now we want to remind our viewers how this conflict really started. CBS News anchor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=0.0s)]
*  Alana Zak walks us through the major events that have unfolded in the Middle [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=5.4s)]
*  East over the past year. On October 7th, Hamas launched multiple terrorist attacks [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=9.32s)]
*  on concertgoers at a musical festival and Kibbutzim, those are traditional [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=15.56s)]
*  farming communities along the Gaza border. Approximately 1,200 people died, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=19.36s)]
*  primarily civilians and 251 people were taken hostage. Then within hours of the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=23.96s)]
*  terrorist attack, Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes into Gaza. After [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=30.6s)]
*  about a month of airstrikes, Israeli forces launched a ground offensive into [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=35.04s)]
*  northern Gaza on October 27th. The military said that the land operations [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=39.8s)]
*  were necessary to rescue the hostages and quote destroy Hamas governing and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=44.42s)]
*  military capabilities. Hundreds of thousands of Gazan citizens were told [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=48.28s)]
*  to evacuate south to the city of Kahnunis. Then after nearly two months [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=52.36s)]
*  of fighting, Israel and Hamas agreed to a four-day ceasefire which was eventually [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=57.84s)]
*  expanded to a full seven days and ultimately a hundred and five hostages [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=62.2s)]
*  were released by Hamas and 240 Palestinian prisoners were released by [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=68.2s)]
*  Israel. A larger amount of critical aid including medicine, food and gasoline was [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=72.92s)]
*  also allowed in. Then on December 4th, Israel launched phase two of its ground [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=77.48s)]
*  offensive. Now this time it targets southern Gaza and Kahnunis. Now this was [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=83.12s)]
*  controversial because as you recall Israel had previously told the hundreds [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=89.16s)]
*  of thousands of people who were living in northern Gaza to go south. Now the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=92.84s)]
*  military encouraged all the civilians to head further south to Ruffa, that's a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  Gazan city that borders Egypt. Meanwhile the Houthis, they're a Shia Muslim group [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=101.46000000000001s)]
*  engaged in a civil war with the Sunni majority in Yemen. They began launching [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=106.96s)]
*  missiles at ships passing through the Red Sea in support of Palestinians in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  Gaza. So starting on January 11th, the US and UK launched multiple airstrikes into [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=114.88s)]
*  Yemen in an attempt to restore safety to that critical shipping route. That [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=120.41999999999999s)]
*  conflict is still ongoing. Then that brings us to April. After months of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=124.8s)]
*  increasing tensions between Israel and Iran, things started to turn violent. Iran [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  provides funding and training to the terrorist groups Hezbollah and Hamas in [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=135.8s)]
*  addition to the Houthis and Israel launched a missile attack at Iran's [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=139.60000000000002s)]
*  diplomatic mission in Syria killing two top Iranian military leaders. Ten days [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=143.28s)]
*  later Iran retaliated and launched 300 missiles and drones into Israel, the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=149.96s)]
*  majority of which were intercepted by a coalition of Israeli and allied [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=156.24s)]
*  Meanwhile back in Gaza, Israel began pushing into Ruffa on May 7th. Now this [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  combined with a renewed fighting effort into northern Gaza worsened the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=167.12s)]
*  humanitarian crisis and today nearly 96% of Palestinians in Gaza are facing a [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=170.6s)]
*  food crisis and the UN warns that the region could reach famine level soon. The [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=176.36s)]
*  death toll in Gaza has also reached over 41,000, primarily civilians according to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=181.36s)]
*  Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health. The IDF says nearly 400 Israeli soldiers [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=187.52s)]
*  have also died during the past few months of fighting. And concerns have [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=192.4s)]
*  been growing recently over widening war in the region between Israel and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  Lebanese Hezbollah fighters. That's a terrorist group with a long history of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  attacks against Israel. Those have ramped up recently and you'll recall Israel [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=204.08s)]
*  targeted Hezbollah with exploding pagers and walkie-talkies, injuring some [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  civilians in the process. And in the last month the Israeli government killed [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=212.56s)]
*  leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, bringing a shadow war with Iran into the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=216.52s)]
*  foreground. For their part, Iran launched an attack on Israel on October 1st and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=221.0s)]
*  Israel has vowed to respond. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNw5Secw2VI&t=225.96s)]
