# Husam Zomlot, Palestinian ambassador to the U.K, says U.S. needs to be "honest mediator"
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4)
*  Hussam Zemlat is the Palestinian Authority ambassador to the United Kingdom. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us from London this morning. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=4.0s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  You were most recently also the representative of the Palestinian Authority here in the United [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=8.72s)]
*  States. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=13.3s)]
*  Secretary Blinken was in Ramallah today. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=15.3s)]
*  There were no public statements made. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=17.8s)]
*  Was this a tense meeting with your president? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=19.8s)]
*  Yes, because there are differences. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=24.0s)]
*  Our president demanded an immediate ceasefire to the atrocious, murderous assault by Israel [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=28.12s)]
*  on our civilians, on our people. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=34.6s)]
*  This is not a war against Hamas. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=36.4s)]
*  It's clear since it started it's a war against our people, not only in Gaza, by the way, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=38.2s)]
*  but also in the West Bank. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=42.78s)]
*  Ten thousand innocent civilians, almost half of them are children. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=44.64s)]
*  And therefore this is the key point now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=49.84s)]
*  Not only because we want to stop the atrocities, the carnage, the deliberate killing of our [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=51.8s)]
*  people, but also we don't want this to spread over. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=57.88s)]
*  Every minute we wait there is a risk of spreading over. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=61.8s)]
*  And thirdly, we need to see the U.S. playing the role of an honest mediator, not adopting [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=66.12s)]
*  the Israeli narrative and the Israeli line, given how hysteric and with the genocidal [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=72.42s)]
*  rhetoric coming out of Tel Aviv right now. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=79.28s)]
*  We needed a grownup in the room, and that is the U.S. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=82.0s)]
*  Unfortunately we haven't heard that, and that's why we did not come up with a joint [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=85.2s)]
*  statement. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=88.64s)]
*  We had some good ideas from the Secretary of State Blinken about the future. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=90.08s)]
*  We had his commitment to a political resolution that will bring about an end to Israel's [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=94.44s)]
*  occupation, a comprehensive one that includes the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=99.2s)]
*  as the capital of the state of Palestine. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  And we agree with all of that, but there will be a time to discuss that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=106.22s)]
*  Now is the time to stop the barrels of the gun, to stop the murder of our civilians. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=110.16s)]
*  And this whole talk, Margaret, about poses, humanitarian poses, is simply irresponsible, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  poses of crimes against humanity. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  So we're going to pose for six hours killing our children and then we resume killing the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=125.12s)]
*  children? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, this doesn't stand even international law. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  So yes, there are disagreements and we seek more. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=132.92s)]
*  Let me interrupt you here and say, you know, the Deputy National Security Advisor to the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=135.64s)]
*  President gave the Palestinian Authority credit for maintaining stability in the West Bank [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=139.08s)]
*  today. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=143.52s)]
*  Israeli forces say they detained 1,200 people since October 7th, 740 of them associated [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=145.52s)]
*  with Hamas in the West Bank. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=152.52s)]
*  So how stable is the West Bank and the Palestinian Authority right now? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  It is not stable and that's not an accurate description of the situation in the West Bank. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  Our people in the West Bank all over are subjected to attacks by the settler militias that your [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=166.52s)]
*  White House and Secretary of State spoke about. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=175.08s)]
*  It's very volatile and dangerous. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=177.88s)]
*  Many, many Palestinians over the last three weeks, you're talking about more than 134, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=179.68s)]
*  the last number I got killed by Israeli illegal Israeli militias and the Israeli army. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=184.84s)]
*  You're talking about provocations in Jerusalem and you know how volatile the situation in [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=192.6s)]
*  Jerusalem and you're talking about an assault against our people everywhere. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=197.2s)]
*  So this isn't about West Bank and Gaza. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=200.72s)]
*  The West Bank and Gaza are subjected to the very same exercise. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  Understood, but I'm asking about your... [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=207.16s)]
*  Allow me, allow me, allow me, Margarita. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=209.92s)]
*  Let me ask you though about your government because there is a serious conversation being [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=210.92s)]
*  had by American diplomats about the Palestinian Authority taking on a role of governing in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=214.48s)]
*  Gaza as well. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=221.84s)]
*  So talk to me about that because we just heard that you have a financial problem right now [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=223.56s)]
*  in part because the Israeli government is withholding some of the tax revenues and claiming [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=228.96s)]
*  they're doing it because Palestinian Authority hasn't condemned Hamas adequately and those [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=235.28s)]
*  October 7th attacks. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  So do you want to clear the air and clearly condemn the attack in Hamas today? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=242.28s)]
*  No, I want to clear the record. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=246.88000000000002s)]
*  First of all, the Palestinian Authority is not what represents the Palestinian people. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  It's the PLO. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=253.32s)]
*  It's the Palestine Liberation Organization. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=254.39999999999998s)]
*  I represented the PLO in Washington. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=256.2s)]
*  Now I represent the PLO in London. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=258.03999999999996s)]
*  The PA does not have external arms. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=261.2s)]
*  The sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people is the PLO. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=263.28s)]
*  Number two, let me clarify another matter. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=267.12s)]
*  It's the state of Palestine that will take over and protect its people in the West Bank, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=269.56s)]
*  in Jerusalem and in Gaza once the Palestinian occupied territory is liberated. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=274.28s)]
*  Number three, it is the opportunity for the U.S. to be the peacemaker. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=279.64s)]
*  I'm sure you're concerned about that tax revenue though. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=283.32s)]
*  Let me... [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=286.2s)]
*  Do you want to clear the air and condemn it? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=287.2s)]
*  De-designate the PLO from the terrorist list in the U.S. Congress. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=291.52s)]
*  Your Secretary of State just shook the hand of the president of the PLO. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=296.8s)]
*  After 30 years of signing the Oslo Accords, after 30 years of committing to international [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=301.32s)]
*  law and negotiations, the U.S. should do that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=305.36s)]
*  The U.S. should recognize the state of Palestine and allow us to be a full member in the U.N. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=308.12s)]
*  And the U.S. must immediately stop vetoing our attempts at accountability in the ICC. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=312.56s)]
*  These are decades' worth of problems. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=319.32s)]
*  These are decades' worth of problems. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=320.32s)]
*  I'm just asking about this one specific issue on October 7th and the tax revenue. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=322.64s)]
*  Not the kids. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=327.36s)]
*  It's the result of us not really focusing on the root cause. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  This is the moment of the U.S. to play the role of... [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=332.44s)]
*  I understand there are deep root causes, but on that specific condemnation, it would just [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=334.08s)]
*  be a very quick answer. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=337.62s)]
*  And allow me, Margaret, because I watched your interview with the Israeli ambassador [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=339.18s)]
*  and he said two things, very important. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=344.86s)]
*  He said, you know, those are unintended consequences, the 10,000 innocent people, the almost 5,000 [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=346.74s)]
*  children. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=352.78000000000003s)]
*  I want to also clear the record here. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=353.78000000000003s)]
*  This is deliberate. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=356.58s)]
*  And this has been the Israeli military doctrine since its establishment, hitting the civilians [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=357.82s)]
*  so they put pressure on the fighters. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=362.62s)]
*  From the time of the Nakba, 1948, and pushing out ethnically cleansing two-thirds of the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=365.74s)]
*  nation to Beirut and Sabra and Shatila, to Gaza and everywhere, this is a military doctrine. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=370.5s)]
*  Number two, Israel commits to international law. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=375.5s)]
*  If they commit to international law, this is not a war. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=378.86s)]
*  A war does not happen between an occupied and an occupier. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=381.06s)]
*  This is an oppression, a repression of our people. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=384.38s)]
*  Wars only happen between two sovereign states. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=388.02s)]
*  So this is a moment when you empower the state of Palestine that will be able to protect [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=390.26s)]
*  its people, Margaret. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=395.06s)]
*  We have to leave a conversation there, but it's very clear that it's really the United [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=396.34s)]
*  States talking about a peace settlement, two state solutions, and you did not clearly condemn [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=401.26s)]
*  that. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=407.09999999999997s)]
*  So, Ambassador, thank you for sharing the Palestinian point of view. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJlVuWbfA4&t=408.09999999999997s)]
