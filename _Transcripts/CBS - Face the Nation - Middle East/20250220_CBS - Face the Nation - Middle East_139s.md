# Bodies of 4 Israeli hostages released by Hamas
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ)
*  We turn our focus now to the Middle East, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=0.0s)]
*  where Hamas has for the first time released the bodies [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=1.74s)]
*  of deceased Israeli hostages. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=5.26s)]
*  The militant group is believed to have handed over [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=7.44s)]
*  the remains of Sheree Bebas and her two children, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=9.9s)]
*  Ariel and Kefir, as well as 83-year-old Oded Lifshitz. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=13.82s)]
*  For more on this, let's bring in CBS News contributor Robert [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=19.22s)]
*  Berger. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=21.54s)]
*  He's following developments for us from Jerusalem. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=21.94s)]
*  Just past 2 in the afternoon, where you are, Robert, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=24.1s)]
*  the bodies, I understand, have been transported by convoy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=26.38s)]
*  I was seeing some of the footage into Israel. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=29.3s)]
*  Describe that to us and what happens next. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  Well, it's a very somber day here in Israel, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=36.0s)]
*  because the Bebas family, the mother and the two kids, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=38.78s)]
*  the images of them being abducted from their kibbutz [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=42.94s)]
*  on October 7th have simply stuck with the nation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=46.82s)]
*  It symbolizes the agony of the nation. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=50.58s)]
*  Kefir Bebas was only nine months old at the time. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=55.1s)]
*  The youngest Israeli hostage, his brother, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=58.56s)]
*  was four years old at the time. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=60.96s)]
*  So everyone is watching this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=62.68s)]
*  There have been people out on the streets [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=65.64s)]
*  to honor the bodies being brought back home. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=67.8s)]
*  It's a sad day, but I guess it gives some closure [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=71.2s)]
*  to the families, because at least they're back. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=76.16s)]
*  We know what happened to them, and they'll [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=79.2s)]
*  get a proper burial in Israel. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=81.28s)]
*  Quite jarring to see. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=84.16s)]
*  This is the first time Hamas handed over [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=85.68s)]
*  bodies of deceased hostages, but considering [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  some of them were just kids so young, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  how are Israelis reacting to this? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=92.82000000000001s)]
*  Well, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=96.56s)]
*  the fact that Hamas kidnapped kids, babies, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=99.12s)]
*  shows the kind of monstrous neighbors [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=104.5s)]
*  that Israel is dealing with. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=107.48s)]
*  People are angry about it, obviously. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=109.2s)]
*  This is only one family that was, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  a lot of families were not only taken captive, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  a lot of families in Naki Butz were completely [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=118.92s)]
*  wiped out on October 7th. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=122.12s)]
*  So, you know, it's a sad day, but I think people [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=124.04s)]
*  are glad to see at least the bodies getting home [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=128.96s)]
*  for a proper burial, and hopefully the release [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=131.68s)]
*  of more hostages. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=134.44s)]
*  All right, Robert Berger with the latest. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=135.84s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uh_GiVflBQ&t=137.48000000000002s)]
