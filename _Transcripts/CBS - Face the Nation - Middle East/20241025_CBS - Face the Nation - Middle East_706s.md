# Latest details on Israel's long-awaited counterstrike on Iran
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8)
*  If you are just joining us now, CBS News can report some breaking news out of the Middle East, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=0.0s)]
*  that Israel has launched some long anticipated retaliatory strikes on Iran. At this point, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=5.68s)]
*  it looks like it is limited to military targets. We want to go to CBS News Senior Foreign Affairs [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=12.24s)]
*  correspondent, sorry, we're going to go to CBS News foreign correspondent, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=18.64s)]
*  Remy Inesensio. He is there in the theater. Remy, you first said that you were hearing about some [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=22.0s)]
*  reports of explosions in Iran just about an hour ago at this point. What more have you been able to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=29.84s)]
*  learn? Sure. Hi, Lana. Yes, about an hour ago, we did hear those initial reports of explosions [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=36.72s)]
*  coming out of Iran's capital of Tehran, in addition to another city just west of Tehran, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=45.28s)]
*  the city of Karaj, which is about 30 miles west of Tehran. And in that past hour, we have had [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=50.4s)]
*  confirmation from the Israel Defense Forces themselves, from spokesperson Daniel Higary, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=58.16s)]
*  saying that they are continuing to conduct precise strikes on what he says military targets there [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  in Iran. And that, of course, is important because how Israel strikes Iran will then dictate on what, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=70.96s)]
*  if any, retaliation Iran might then do in response. We do, of course, have to stress that the U.S. has [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=77.84s)]
*  applied a THAAD missile defense system here to Israel in the past week or so that is now up and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=85.2s)]
*  running. And that, we understand, had been put there in place in anticipation of any potential [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=89.92s)]
*  retaliation from Iran. And Remy, it is currently the wee hours of the morning there in Israel. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  It's the middle of the night, but it's also Shabbat right now, 3 a.m. Is it surprising that this is [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=106.08s)]
*  happening right now? Is there anything more that you can tell us about the timing? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=112.4s)]
*  It may be surprising from a religious aspect here. It is 3 a.m. here in Tel Aviv, 3 30 a.m. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  in Tehran. But the fact of the matter is that this retaliation by Israel against Iran has been [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=127.12s)]
*  telegraphed for the past three weeks, ever since Iran fired its some 200 ballistic missiles [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=134.72s)]
*  at Israel on October 1st. So the timing of this, there was a comment from Israel saying [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=142.32s)]
*  that the retaliation, the strike, would be surprising. And so to your question regarding [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=149.76s)]
*  the nature of the evening, with it being the Sabbath right now, this could be the aspect of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=155.6s)]
*  it that Iran might have been taken off guard just a little bit, perhaps thinking that Israel would [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=161.44s)]
*  not retaliate on the most important day of its week. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=166.88s)]
*  It is worth noting, though, that it is the end of the holiday season there. Are we learning anything [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=171.44s)]
*  more, Ramey, about potential damages in Iran, actual areas that were struck, or is it just at [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  this point too early to know that? Yeah, it's too early right now. Again, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=185.28s)]
*  we heard only about an hour or so ago of those initial strikes, but we have been seeing initial [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=191.92s)]
*  reports of explosions again in and around the capital Tehran. There are unconfirmed reports [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=199.04s)]
*  that the headquarters and the barracks of the IRGC, that's the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=205.83999999999997s)]
*  have been targeted, but that's just initial unconfirmed reports there. As the hours continue [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=211.6s)]
*  on into the early part of the morning and as daylight comes, we will see what damage [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=217.44s)]
*  has happened in Iran and what, if anything, Iranian state media does report out on this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=224.24s)]
*  But as we are right now at 3 a.m. in the morning, we're only hearing of explosions, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=229.84s)]
*  reports, confirmation from the Israel Defense Forces, but no reports officially of any damage [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=234.24s)]
*  in Iran. Well, we know you will stay on top of it, Ramey Anasensio in Tel Aviv. Thank you. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=240.4s)]
*  Of course. CBS News Senior National Security Correspondent Charlie Daggett covers the Pentagon. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=247.44s)]
*  He is there for us now. Charlie, our viewers have heard a lot of discussion about the THAAD system [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=254.4s)]
*  that the United States has supplied. Give us some background information about how it operates and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=260.88s)]
*  why it's important that, or why it's notable that there are U.S. troops there to help operate it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=266.64s)]
*  Lana, that's important. What you said was notable, because this is the first time we've had [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=274.64s)]
*  U.S. troops on the ground in a combat capacity since October 7th. Yes, there have been U.S. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  advisors there. There have been U.S. special forces trying to help hunt down hostages and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=285.2s)]
*  help down, hunt down targets, Hamas targets inside Gaza. This is the first time you're going to see [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=291.44s)]
*  soldiers on the ground in a combat role. And the reason is, after that October 1st attack from Iran, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=296.8s)]
*  it was unexpected. The scale of the attack was unexpected. It's the largest [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=304.08s)]
*  ballistic missile attack in any country you've seen, let alone Israel. And it was between 180 [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=308.08s)]
*  and 200, as Ramey said. And there were some of those ballistic missiles that got through. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=313.2s)]
*  Now, we all know the much-vaunted Israeli missile defense system. You've got the David Sling, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=319.12s)]
*  which takes over from the Iron Dome, which is more of a short-range. But this takes out short-to-mid [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=324.4s)]
*  range ballistic missiles. So it was a specific weapon specifically put there and manned by U.S. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=329.76s)]
*  forces. This is important because if they're expecting that kind of Iranian retaliation, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=336.4s)]
*  this fills a gap there. It is a battalion or sorry, it's a group of vehicles that can fire up to 48 [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=341.52s)]
*  interceptors, which doesn't sound like a lot. But the battleships that were involved in the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=350.56s)]
*  intercepting of the Iranian missiles, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, on October 7th, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=355.91999999999996s)]
*  they only launched about 12 missiles. So that puts it in sort of reference as to what this THAAD [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=362.96s)]
*  system can do potentially. And we have just received a statement from the National Security [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=368.4s)]
*  Council. It's short, but it says, we understand that Israel is conducting targeted strikes against [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  military targets in Iran as an exercise of self-defense and in response to Iran's ballistic [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=379.67999999999995s)]
*  missile attack against Israel on October 1st. Charlie, talk to us about the significance of [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=385.44s)]
*  coordination between Israel and the United States, both in terms of our long-standing [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=392.48s)]
*  partnerships, but also in terms of what has been in some cases a rocky relationship. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=400.16s)]
*  It has, Lana, especially in recent weeks, because as as Margaret had pointed out, the assassination [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=406.0s)]
*  of Hassan Nasrallah, that literally took place while Israeli Defense Minister Yoav [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=412.32s)]
*  Gallant was on the phone to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, literally on the phone as that was [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=419.2s)]
*  taking place, a major escalation. And then the retaliation against Iran, of course the United [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=425.04s)]
*  States, we've got skin in the game, certainly on the ground now inside Israel, but we have to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=432.64s)]
*  remember there are 40,000 U.S. forces across that region, on the ground, through Iraq, in Syria, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=438.64s)]
*  and then you have a carrier strike group, you've got an aircraft carrier, a number of destroyers [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  off the coast of the Mediterranean, you've got a couple of destroyers and a amphibious group there [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  with 2,000 Marines. You have a lot of U.S. military assets there, and the reason I mention that, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=461.36s)]
*  not just in the defense of Israel, but if Israel attacks Iran, as it has done, it's now confirmed, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=467.68s)]
*  as that has done, that also puts U.S. forces in the line of fire. So there needs to be a coordination [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=474.48s)]
*  between Israel and the United States, because if something large scale like that happens, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=481.2s)]
*  then the United States, and I'm told this all the time here at the Pentagon, this is a planning [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=487.2s)]
*  organization, right? They plan for any contingency, so they have to plan for the retaliation from [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=491.68s)]
*  Israel, but then they have to expect, and one of the reasons that system is in place, that Iran [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=498.32s)]
*  will retaliate in kind. And I think it's very important to point out here, you know, the last [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  time Israel retaliated from the Iranian attack, it was a matter of four or five days. This is more [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=508.32s)]
*  than three weeks now, and I think that addresses the scale of the Iranian attack to begin with, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=514.88s)]
*  and now I guess once again we're in this sort of whole pattern, a wait and see. Was it a limited [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=520.72s)]
*  strike? I guess at first light we'll see what was targeted and the damage that was done, and whether [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=526.08s)]
*  this will maybe escalate to see what the Iranians will do, but in terms of the United States, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=532.24s)]
*  they're fully forward-postured, as they like to use that term, with their military capabilities [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=537.12s)]
*  and capacities, including that U.S. missile defense system now in Israel. Well, Charlie, I'm so glad [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=543.2s)]
*  that you brought up the ways in which the United States has not just a military presence in the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=549.2s)]
*  region, but also an obligation to all those folks that we have over there. As this proxy war between [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  Israel and Iran has played out, and now it is not just a proxy, it is actively engaged, but the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=566.24s)]
*  United States has also been involved in a more active way. I'm thinking specifically, as you're [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=573.12s)]
*  talking about this, about strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen that have been targeting [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=577.92s)]
*  U.S. and other foreign ships. Is it possible that in any way all that forward-facing U.S. defense [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=584.56s)]
*  planning will be implemented in any of these other aspects in the region? Lana, let me bring up [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=592.16s)]
*  something that happened just over a week ago. Okay, so the United States has been targeting [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=599.1999999999999s)]
*  Houthi targets inside Yemen. It's been going on for some time. There's sort of tit-for-tat going [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=603.76s)]
*  on that the Houthis have been shooting or aiming for anyway. Commercial ships and U.S. battleships, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=609.92s)]
*  U.S. battleships are fully capable of intercepting, whether it's coming towards them or going [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=619.04s)]
*  somewhere else. But to launch a strike, to launch airstrikes, that's kind of next level. That's to go [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=622.8s)]
*  after the Houthis in Yemen itself. About a week ago, they launched B-2 bombers, B-2 stealth bombers. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=628.16s)]
*  They don't launch those for any occasion. Those come from the United States. And the reason that [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=635.52s)]
*  it's important, that's important, these are stealth bombers, and they are capable of deep penetration, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=640.3199999999999s)]
*  the deep bombs that can take out, in this case, Houthi targets. And without saying so much, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=646.16s)]
*  they're saying this is sending a message to regional partners, essentially that they can fire up [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=652.5600000000001s)]
*  a stealth bomber, fly at long distances and penetrate deep targets. Well, that's a message [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=658.48s)]
*  without saying it out loud to Iran. So there has been a military flex. And that's the first time [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=666.16s)]
*  we've seen that happen, that they actually fired up B-2 bombers for these attacks in Yemen. So yes, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=671.6s)]
*  you've got the aircraft carriers. You've got a number of F-18s there that are still deployed, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=677.92s)]
*  F-35s that are still deployed. This is a squadron of F-22s that are still deployed. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=682.7199999999999s)]
*  It's about as forward-postured, I hate to keep using that phrase, but it's the way the military [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=688.0s)]
*  use it, as it can be without another carrier strike group in the region, which may be under [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=693.4399999999999s)]
*  discussion. We can't confirm that yet. All right. Charlie Daggada at the Pentagon, thank you. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=699.1999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ElhUjqCc8&t=704.3199999999999s)]
