# Satellite photos show aftermath of U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU)

*  mission called Operation Midnight Hammer [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=23.78s)]
*  included seven B2 Spirit bombers. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=26.54s)]
*  Those bombers left the Whiteman Air [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=29.4s)]

*  Another group of the same bombers [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=34.72s)]
*  flew over the Pacific to act as decoys. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=36.879999999999995s)]

*  from the strike on photo and the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=46.12s)]
*  satellite images from Maxar Technologies. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=48.54s)]
*  Several of the tunnel entrances that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=50.64s)]
*  lead into the underground facility [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=52.84s)]
*  were blocked with dirt following the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=54.9s)]
*  air strikes. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  Large diameter craters can also be [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=58.28s)]
*  seen on top of a ridge over the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=60.54s)]

*  know to the Trump administration [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=64.96s)]
*  says this is not an act of war. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=66.6s)]
*  Iran quickly launched another [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  missile strike until the hours after [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=70.32s)]
*  Trump announced his targeted attack [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=72.6s)]
*  on Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=74.72s)]
*  At least 18 people were injured [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=76.36s)]
*  in the latest attack seen here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  The two sides are now entering their [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=81.32s)]
*  11th day of exchanging fire. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  Israeli forces continue their [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=85.88s)]
*  strikes on Iran this morning. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=87.61999999999999s)]
*  Officials say they struck the heart [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=89.56s)]
*  of Tehran by focusing on regime [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=91.8s)]
*  headquarters. The Israeli military [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  also says they are now targeting [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  Iran's notorious Evan prison. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=97.96s)]
*  Now back here in the States, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=99.44s)]
*  President Trump continues to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=101.56s)]
*  defend his decision to carry [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=102.94s)]
*  out this weekend strike. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=104.62s)]
*  He also seemingly suggested a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  regime change on social media. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=107.72s)]
*  His post yesterday said quote, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=109.56s)]
*  it is not politically correct to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=111.28s)]
*  use the term regime change, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=113.44s)]
*  but if the current Iranian regime [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=115.2s)]
*  is unable to make Iran great again, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  why wouldn't they be a regime change? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=119.64s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=122.16s)]
*  tried to cool down those comments [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=123.76s)]
*  and face the nation just yesterday. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=125.72s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  So therefore. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=128.84s)]
*  Are you actually looking for [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=130.52s)]
*  regime change? That misses the point. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=132.72s)]
*  I don't like that they chant those things, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=135.04s)]
*  but one thing is that they chant those things. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=137.56s)]
*  Another thing is that they chant those things [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  all over the world. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=142.96s)]
*  And they have long range missiles [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=144.24s)]
*  that can reach the United States one day, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=145.84s)]
*  and they have the potential to be [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=148.12s)]
*  one step away from a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, one day could be tomorrow. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=152.0s)]
*  Could be a week from now. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  Could be a month from now. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=154.72s)]
*  You know all that takes is the flip of a switch. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=156.08s)]
*  By the way, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  they're not going to broadcast that to the world. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=159.36s)]
*  By the time we figure out that they're doing it, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  you have all the pieces in place. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=164.0s)]
*  OK, it's like you have loaded a gun here [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=165.84s)]
*  and ammunition. It only takes one second. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  We have other targets that we could hit, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  but we don't know exactly what their [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=172.2s)]
*  targets are. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=175.0s)]
*  In other words, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  the senior White House correspondent [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=176.32s)]
*  Weijia Zhang will join us in just a moment [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=178.04s)]
*  with more from the White House [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=180.6s)]
*  and the response first, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=182.6s)]
*  let's bring in CBS News, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=183.83999999999997s)]
*  senior foreign correspondent [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=185.2s)]
*  Holly Williams from Iraq. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=186.48s)]
*  Holly, thanks for joining us today. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=187.83999999999997s)]
*  There seems to be a lot of confusion [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  about whether there was any damage at [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  Fordo. So what do we know? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=193.88s)]
*  And do we have an idea of any enriched [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=195.48s)]
*  uranium was actually at that site? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=197.39999999999998s)]
*  Morning Mugo. Well those B2 stealth bombers seem to have done their work at least judging by the bomb craters that seem to be evident in satellite imagery. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=198.8s)]
*  There's a kind of triumphal tone coming from Washington I think. President Trump called those strikes a quote spectacular military success. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=206.8s)]
*  And then the Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=213.8s)]
*  Now despite that, Iranian state media has claimed that stockpiled uranium was actually moved away from those nuclear sites before the US strikes. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=219.8s)]
*  And not just Fordow, the site that's been getting so much attention and that is or was fortified. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=229.8s)]
*  Now we cannot independently verify those claims from Iranian state media, but we spoke to one Middle Eastern security expert who found it plausible that the Iranians were able to move at least some of their stockpiled uranium. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=235.8s)]
*  And then on Face the Nation yesterday, the Secretary of State Marco Rubio was asked how much nuclear material was moved prior to the attack. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=247.8s)]
*  And he said quote, no one will know for sure for days, but I doubt they moved it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=255.8s)]
*  Now one thing to consider is that despite all of the Iranian nuclear scientists who've been targeted and killed by Israel and then these US strikes, there's the possibility that Iran will want to rebuild what it has lost. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=260.8s)]
*  And one Iranian lawmaker seem to speak to that in a social media post over the weekend saying quote, knowledge cannot be bombed. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=272.8s)]
*  So Holly, there is the big question though of what happens next now. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=281.8s)]
*  Right, that is a very big question. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=289.8s)]
*  US forces here in the Middle East, including here in Iraq, are on high alert bracing for a possible Iranian retaliation or retaliation from one of the several militia groups that Iran backs in this region. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=290.8s)]
*  But I think big picture, there are a few possibilities. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=301.8s)]
*  The first is that Iran capitulates and gives up its nuclear program. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=303.8s)]
*  That is clearly what President Trump is hoping for. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=307.8s)]
*  The second is that the Iranians double down and say to themselves, you know, these attacks prove that we need to be able to better defend ourselves and they're more motivated than before to produce nuclear weapons. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=309.8s)]
*  Now, of course, Mugo, they could do both. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=319.8s)]
*  They could publicly try and find a diplomatic solution and then in secret try and rebuild their nuclear program. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=321.8s)]
*  Then there's that social media post that you highlighted earlier where President Trump seemed to raise the possibility of regime change in Iran. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=327.8s)]
*  We don't know how serious he was and the White House said he was simply raising the question. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=335.8s)]
*  But as you'll remember, engineered regime change here in Iraq and in Afghanistan led the US into a quagmire costing the United States both blood and treasure. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=339.8s)]
*  That is very true. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=351.8s)]
*  We shall wait and see. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=352.8s)]
*  Time will tell what comes next. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=353.8s)]
*  Holly Williams in Iraq for us. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=355.8s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time today. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=356.8s)]
*  Now, earlier today, press secretary Caroline Levitt spoke to reporters on the White House driveway to answer questions about this weekend strike. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=357.8s)]
*  She defend Trump's remarks on a possible regime change in Iran. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=365.8s)]
*  Listen to what she said. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=370.8s)]
*  The president's posture in our military posture has not changed. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=371.8s)]
*  The president was just simply raising a question that I think many people around the world are asking. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=375.8s)]
*  If the Iranian regime refuses to give up their nuclear program or engage in talks, we just took out their nuclear program on Saturday night, as you all know. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=380.8s)]
*  But if they refuse to engage in diplomacy moving forward, why shouldn't the Iranian people rise up against this brutal terrorist regime? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=389.8s)]
*  That's a question the president raised last night. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=397.8s)]
*  But as far as our military posture, it hasn't changed. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=399.8s)]
*  Caroline, what is the timetable the president has given Iran right now to come to the negotiating table? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=401.8s)]
*  He has made his message to Iran quite clear. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=407.8s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Zhang for more on this. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=411.8s)]
*  Weijia, thanks for your time today. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=416.8s)]
*  The president already warned Iran not to retaliate in response to the strike. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=418.8s)]
*  But does the administration remain open to possible negotiations with Iran? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=422.8s)]
*  They're not only open to it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=429.8s)]
*  They are urging Iran to come back to the negotiating table, to strike a deal with the U.S., to agree to abandon its nuclear program. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=431.8s)]
*  And the president warned that if Iran does not choose the path of diplomacy and chooses something else, that there would be consequences. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=439.8s)]
*  In other words, if there is any kind of retaliatory action against the U.S., whether it be personnel or assets in the region or otherwise, that there would be consequences. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=448.8s)]
*  And the president also added that there are other targets to hit and indicated there would not be any hesitancy on the part of the U.S. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=460.8s)]
*  to strike again if it meant defending itself from another Iranian attack. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=469.8s)]
*  But, you know, even though the administration is urging Tehran to take a diplomatic off ramp, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=475.8s)]
*  the Iran-UN mission just posted on social media that the U.S. destroyed diplomacy. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=483.8s)]
*  The so-called offer of diplomacy was nothing more than a deceitful ploy, Mugo. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=491.8s)]
*  And we also have new details about the timeline of the strike and Trump's line of thinking when it comes to it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=497.8s)]
*  What more can you tell us about that? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=504.8s)]
*  So the White House confirms that the president made this decision just a few hours before the strike actually happened. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=506.8s)]
*  Things were in place. He got a phone call on Marine One from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who said, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=518.8s)]
*  we need to know whether to move forward with this attack or not. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=525.8s)]
*  And the president gave the green light. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=530.8s)]
*  And then just hours later came here to the White House, walked inside, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=532.8s)]
*  and then in less than 40 minutes was watching the strikes unfold with his national security team inside the situation room. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=537.8s)]
*  And so it's unclear exactly when he had already made this decision, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=545.8s)]
*  whether he was leaning toward that when just two days prior, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=552.8s)]
*  the White House press secretary delivered a message on behalf of President Trump to say that Iran had a maximum of two weeks to try to come to a deal to abandon its program. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=558.8s)]
*  And so we are told that at some point along the way, the president decided it was increasingly clear that any diplomacy with Iran was not actually going to happen. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=570.8s)]
*  And so they say he moved to do this in order to ensure Iran's nuclear capabilities were halted. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=582.8s)]
*  And we saw this all comes as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. He is heading to The Hague for a NATO summit and Trump is expected to make his way there tomorrow. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=591.8s)]
*  What exactly are we watching for there, especially in the wake of this strike against Iran? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=600.8s)]
*  Well, there's no doubt this is going to be a major topic of discussion, especially as it relates to Russia. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=606.8s)]
*  We know that Russian officials were meeting with Iranians today about the strikes, about possible next steps. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=613.8s)]
*  But our reporting indicates that the president wanted to show up to the NATO summit with a position of strength, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=621.8s)]
*  which also went into his calculation for showing that strength via these three strikes. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=629.8s)]
*  And so, you know, he has often said that his policy is America first. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=634.8s)]
*  He believes that you achieve peace through strength. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=640.8s)]
*  And so that's partly why he wanted to have some kind of a deliverable to show that the U.S. was not just sitting back to let Iran take the lead. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=643.8s)]
*  And so this will certainly be a topic. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=655.8s)]
*  But remember, NATO as a organization is extremely worried about the Russia Ukraine conflict because of where it is and so close to many of its member countries. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=657.8s)]
*  And so that will also be a very important discussion as they try to figure out whether ceasefire there is possible and ultimately whether an end to that conflict is possible. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=673.8s)]
*  All right, we're Jane from the White House for us. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=686.8s)]
*  Thank you so much for your interest. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_ofUGVbHU&t=688.8s)]
