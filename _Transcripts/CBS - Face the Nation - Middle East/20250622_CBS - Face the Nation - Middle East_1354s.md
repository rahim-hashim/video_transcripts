# Face the Nation: Kaine, Khanna, Massie
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY)
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation. Democrat Ro Khanna joins us from San Francisco and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=0.0s)]
*  here in studio is Kentucky Republican Thomas Massey. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=9.48s)]
*  And good morning to both of you gentlemen. I'll start with you, Congressman Massey. You [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=13.08s)]
*  know, I know this is an unlikely pairing. You are on completely different ends of the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=17.8s)]
*  political spectrum, but you both worked on this war powers resolution to prohibit U.S. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=22.56s)]
*  forces from engaging in hostilities against Iran without authorization from Congress. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=27.84s)]
*  The president just blew right past that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=32.04s)]
*  Well, you know, I think I represent part of the coalition that elected President Trump. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=34.36s)]
*  We were tired of endless wars in the Middle East and tired of wars in Eastern Europe. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=39.84s)]
*  And we were promised that we would put our veterans, our immigration policies, and our [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=45.68s)]
*  infrastructure first. And so what Ro and I did, we did this last week when, you know, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=51.48s)]
*  they were rattling the sabers because we saw this coming. We put forward this war powers [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  resolution. I've teamed up with Ro Khanna before on this to his credit. When Joe Biden [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=62.44s)]
*  was president, we tried to rein in the executive and reassert Congress's authority, sole authority [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=67.28s)]
*  to declare war and to engage or authorize the engagement of acts of war. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=74.44s)]
*  Something we talked to other lawmakers about as well in the Senate. I know there's efforts [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=81.4s)]
*  to support you, but the speaker of the House who is from your own party has really rejected [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=86.12s)]
*  this. He says the Article One power of Congress really allows for the president to do this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  It was a limited, necessary, targeted strike, he says. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  Well, he's probably referring to the War Powers Act of 1973, but that's been misinterpreted. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  There were no imminent threat to the United States, which was what would authorize that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=109.24s)]
*  And I think that's peculiar to hear that from the speaker of the House. Look, Congress was [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=114.8s)]
*  on vacation last week when all this was happening. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=119.08s)]
*  You haven't been briefed on any of these details. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=121.83999999999999s)]
*  We haven't been briefed. They should have called us all back. And frankly, we should [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=123.16s)]
*  have debated this War Powers Resolution that Ro Khanna and I offered instead of staying [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=127.36s)]
*  on vacation and doing fundraisers and saying, oh, well, the president's got this under control. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  We're going to cede our constitutional authority. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=137.84s)]
*  Ro Khanna, Congressman Khanna, and we didn't hear from the secretary the explanation as [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=140.72s)]
*  to why now. We haven't heard that from anyone other than a reference to the president had [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=144.8s)]
*  a roughly 60 day timeline on diplomatic talks. But we also know we had more talks scheduled [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=150.44s)]
*  when Israel launched this attack. So it's just it's not exactly clear the emergency. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=156.4s)]
*  You will be briefed, along with other members of Congress, Tuesday. What are the questions [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=165.56s)]
*  you have? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=169.84s)]
*  Well, first of all, the tragedy in this country is that we keep entering these overseas wars. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=170.84s)]
*  We triumphantly declare the mission is accomplished the day after. And then we're left with Americans [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=179.4s)]
*  bearing the consequences for decades. Now, Thomas is absolutely right in showing courage. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=185.4s)]
*  I mean, the headlines all across this country says the United States enters war with Iran. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=191.8s)]
*  He is actually representing a lot of the people in the MAGA base, people like Steve Bannon, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=196.4s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Theo Vann, who has had them on, who's saying we [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=201.16000000000003s)]
*  don't want this war. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  And I heard your interview with Secretary Rubio. He's saying, well, we want a peace [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=208.36s)]
*  deal. We want to make sure that Iran can enrich uranium through civil purposes. Well, we have [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=212.24s)]
*  that. We had that at the JCPOA. And there was not a single violation that the IAEA found [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=219.36s)]
*  during that time. So my question, I guess, is now you're going to force Iran to go covertly [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=226.96s)]
*  in developing this nuclear material. Now you've put American troops at risk. Now you're [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=232.4s)]
*  wasting billions of our dollars because we're sending more troops to the Middle East. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=237.68s)]
*  What did you accomplish? And why are you oblivious to the American people who are sick of these [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=241.68s)]
*  wars? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=247.28000000000003s)]
*  But Congressman, are you open to the idea that there could be intelligence that is disclosed [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=248.92s)]
*  to you in this classified setting on Tuesday that could justify this? Or is any military [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  action in your view, you know, war? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=259.96s)]
*  Well, I'm always open to new intelligence. But the procedure should have been that Congress [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=264.2s)]
*  was briefed before we decided to enter war and that we actually had a vote on it. You [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  have Tulsi Gabbard, who just months ago, the director of intelligence, saying that was [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=276.56s)]
*  not the case. The reality is, and we should just speak openly, there are people who want [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=281.2s)]
*  regime change in Iran and they are egging this president on to bomb. I hope cooler heads [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=285.48s)]
*  will prevail. We need to pass Thomas Massie and my War Powers Resolution to make it clear [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=292.2s)]
*  that we're not going to get further entrenched into the Middle East. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=297.36s)]
*  And Congressman Massie, it's interesting because you were talking about a part of the party [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=301.72s)]
*  you represent. The secretary of state comes from a different part of that same party, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=305.64s)]
*  as you know. And I did own in on the question about intelligence and what it showed. He [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=310.12s)]
*  called it an ambition to weaponize, weaponization ambition. That's different than they're making [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=315.56s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. But are you open to intelligence and persuasion here? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=322.21999999999997s)]
*  I'm open as well. But look, in the first Iraq war, the second Iraq war and the war in Afghanistan, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=327.44s)]
*  when the US first got the briefings, Congress met and debated. It should have been declarations [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=333.48s)]
*  of war, but at least they did an authorization of use of military force. We haven't had that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=338.04s)]
*  This has been turned upside down, this process. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=343.44s)]
*  You heard from Mitch McConnell, the former Republican leader, as senators say, it was [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=347.96s)]
*  a bad week for the isolationists. He was talking about Tucker Carlson and he was talking about [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=352.36s)]
*  Steve Bannon. Do you think that the president is making a choice here or is he trying to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=356.84s)]
*  have it both ways, both saying, I'm going to please the hawks of the party by bombing, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=363.35999999999996s)]
*  but then I'm going to say I want a peace deal and make the isolationists happy by saying, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=368.21999999999997s)]
*  you know, I'm not committing to anything more than one and done. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=372.58s)]
*  Well, I'll concede this. It was a good week for the neocons in the military industrial [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=375.9s)]
*  complex who want war all the time. I wouldn't call my side of the MAGA base isolationists. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=379.7s)]
*  We are exhausted. We are tired from all of these wars and we're non-interventionists. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=387.3s)]
*  I mean, this was one of the promises. I mean, are you going to call President Trump's campaign [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=392.3s)]
*  an isolationist campaign? What he promised us was we would put America first. And I think [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=397.78s)]
*  there are still voices in this administration. You've still got JD Vance. You've still got [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=404.78s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard. You still have RFK Jr. You still got calmer heads that could prevail. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=409.14s)]
*  We're not persuasive in this case, clearly. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=416.26s)]
*  Well, somebody was persuasive. AIPAC is very persuasive. For instance, the Israeli lobby [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=418.74s)]
*  in Congress, if you look at my colleagues' feeds now, they all look the same. They're [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=423.7s)]
*  all tweeting the same message that we've got to support Israel and we've got to do this. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=429.18s)]
*  My question is, does three bombings and we're done with Iran's nuclear ambitions, is that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=433.76s)]
*  the two weeks to slow the spread of 2025? We were told two weeks to slow the spread [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=441.76s)]
*  then. Now we're told it's just going to take three bombings. But what happens when Israel [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=447.76s)]
*  gets bombed again? Is Trump going to sit by and say, no, we're not going to further engage [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=451.8s)]
*  in this war? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=456.84s)]
*  I tried to get answers from the secretary on that question. But when you say the pro-Israel [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=457.44s)]
*  lobby, AIPAC, do you see a difference between Israel's interests and American interests? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=463.4s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. Look, Iran, the reality is they don't have a missile that can reach [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=469.24s)]
*  the United States. They're not near to getting a missile that can reach the United States. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=474.68s)]
*  I think what has happened, what has transpired this week has been planned for months. This [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=479.72s)]
*  administration and maybe even the administration prior to that said, you go in and soften them [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=487.32s)]
*  up, take out their air defense capabilities, and then we'll send in the big bombers. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=492.44s)]
*  Congressman Kana, I know you have raised objections on this program in the past about Israel's [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  operations in Gaza for how it has conducted that war against Hamas. That was a different [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=502.72s)]
*  context. But now you very well may be asked to provide more weaponry to Israel to defend [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=508.84000000000003s)]
*  itself. Do you oppose that as well? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=515.04s)]
*  Well, first, let me just say that it's a totally unfair smear to call people isolationists. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=517.48s)]
*  The vast majority of Americans who don't want more war and want diplomacy. Diplomacy and [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=525.48s)]
*  engagement is not isolationism. But look, on Israel, I have supported aid and support [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=530.6s)]
*  defensively. And even the War Powers Resolution says that if Iran is striking Israel, we can [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  provide defense so that Israel isn't hit. What I opposed was giving Israel offensive [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=545.28s)]
*  weapons to go kill more people in Gaza. I think that war needs to end. But I think the [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=550.88s)]
*  bottom line, Margaret, is what have we achieved here? We're going to push Iran to now be like [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=556.6s)]
*  Pakistan or North Korea, going and try to develop a nuclear bomb covertly. We have put [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=562.24s)]
*  more American troops at risk. We're going to spend more resources going and getting [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=567.88s)]
*  more entrenched in the Middle East. And we've created a generation of hate. It's like, can [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=572.72s)]
*  this country learn? We keep voting for people, for presidents who say we're not going to [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=577.04s)]
*  get into war, and then they keep getting pushed by the Washington Beltway to get us into this [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=581.52s)]
*  mess. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=586.7199999999999s)]
*  Congressman Kana, Congressman Massey, thank you. In a rare bipartisan meeting of the minds, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=587.28s)]
*  at least on this issue. We'll be right back. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=593.68s)]
*  We go now to the Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, who joins us from Richmond, Virginia. Good [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=599.8s)]
*  morning to you, Senator. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=604.4399999999999s)]
*  Good morning, Margaret. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=606.44s)]
*  I know you sit on the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee. But what [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=607.44s)]
*  we just heard from the Pentagon was that Congress was notified after the strike on Iran was [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=612.4000000000001s)]
*  concluded after the U.S. jets are back in safety. Is this sufficient? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=619.5400000000001s)]
*  Margaret, no. Congress needs to authorize a war against Iran, this Trump war against [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=626.4000000000001s)]
*  Iran. We have not. Congress should be consulted with it. We were not. And Congress needs to [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=633.52s)]
*  be notified not after the fact, but in advance. We were not. That's why I filed a war powers [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=638.96s)]
*  resolution that will ripen and be brought to a vote on the floor of the Senate this [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=644.6s)]
*  week. Senator Schumer is working with Leader Thune to make that happen. The United States [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=650.08s)]
*  should not be in an offensive war against Iran without a vote of Congress. The Constitution [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=654.72s)]
*  is completely clear on it. And I am so disappointed that the president has acted so prematurely. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=659.52s)]
*  The Foreign Minister of Israel said Friday night that its own bombing campaign had set [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=667.48s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear program back, quote, at least two or three years, close quote. There [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=672.0s)]
*  was no urgency that suggested, while diplomatic talks were underway, that the U.S. should [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=678.3199999999999s)]
*  take this unilateral action by President Trump's orders yesterday. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=683.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, the vice president was on another network earlier this morning and said, we are not [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=687.6800000000001s)]
*  at war with Iran. We are at war with Iran's nuclear program. There seems to be a lot of [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=692.8000000000001s)]
*  legal parsing on the definition of the word war here. What do you make of that description? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=698.84s)]
*  I think it's BS. And I think anybody hearing it would conclude the same thing. When you're [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=704.24s)]
*  bombing another nation, ask them if they think it's war. They do. Would we think it was war [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=710.6800000000001s)]
*  if Iran bombed a U.S. nuclear facility? Of course we would. And the U.S., you know, we've [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=716.64s)]
*  invaded two neighbors of Iran, Afghanistan and Iraq, to topple their regimes since 2000. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=723.64s)]
*  Those were wars. This is the U.S. jumping into a war of choice at Donald Trump's urging [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=731.64s)]
*  without any compelling national security interests for the United States to act in this way, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=738.5999999999999s)]
*  particularly without a debate and vote in Congress. We should not be sending troops and [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=743.52s)]
*  risking troops' lives in an offensive war without a debate in Congress. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=748.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, just on the facts, though, the president has not authorized ground forces. In fact, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=752.52s)]
*  he said he really doesn't want to send in ground forces. When it came to what was just [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=758.4399999999999s)]
*  described to the public by the Pentagon, it was really characterized as limited in scope. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=763.6s)]
*  It sounds like you believe those early hour descriptions are going to turn out to be false. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=769.92s)]
*  I do. The War Powers Resolution says that a member of Congress can challenge the president [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=775.64s)]
*  if the president initiates hostilities against a foreign nation. Doesn't use the, even though [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=781.8399999999999s)]
*  the title is War Powers Resolution, the statute says if you initiate hostilities without [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=787.12s)]
*  congressional authorization, even a single member of the House or Senate can force a vote [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=793.36s)]
*  on the Senate floor. There is no doubt that the U.S. sending this massive set of Tomahawk [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=798.44s)]
*  missiles and B-2 bombers and bunker busters on three Iranian nuclear sites is hostilities. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=803.8800000000001s)]
*  Now, again, some in the Senate may say this is great and we want to vote for it. I happen [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=810.24s)]
*  to think that getting into a third offensive war in the Middle East in the last 25 years [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=815.32s)]
*  is absolutely reckless and foolish. And I'm going to be doing everything I can to convince [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=819.8000000000001s)]
*  my colleagues of that. I may or may not succeed. But Congress should have the debate and vote [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=825.32s)]
*  on this before we escalate the risk to American troops, which this action has done. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=830.88s)]
*  We know that prior to this action, Northern Command had already directed additional security [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=836.44s)]
*  measures on all U.S. military installations. You've got a lot of military installations [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=842.7600000000001s)]
*  in Virginia. What do you know about the threat to the homeland at this point? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=847.0600000000001s)]
*  We're going to have a briefing Tuesday, Margaret, and I'll learn more then. But what I do know, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=852.74s)]
*  I also have a lot of Virginians deployed in the Middle East. There are about 40,000 U.S. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=856.62s)]
*  troops deployed all over the Middle East, sailors on Navy ships in the Mediterranean and the [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=860.5799999999999s)]
*  Red Sea, folks in land bases in Syria and Iraq. And yes, this action dramatically raises the [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=865.54s)]
*  risk to them. And the question is, for what? If the Iranian nuclear program, Vice President [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=873.54s)]
*  Vance says it's a war against their nuclear program. Of course, we had curtailed that [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=879.94s)]
*  diplomatically a few years ago until Donald Trump tore up the diplomatic deal. But even [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=884.74s)]
*  if you needed to wage war, when the Israeli foreign minister is saying we've set the nuclear [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=889.82s)]
*  program back at least two or three years, why launch this strike, escalating risk to [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=894.82s)]
*  Americans and American troops over the weekend with no real discussion with Congress, no [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=900.7800000000001s)]
*  real debate before the American public. I don't want to be lied into another war in [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=906.3000000000001s)]
*  the way we were with Iraq in 2002. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=911.1800000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Senator. We'll be back in a moment. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=913.94s)]
*  We go now to the former commander of CENTCOM, which controls U.S. forces in the Middle East, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=919.82s)]
*  our CBS News contributor, retired general Frank McKenzie. Welcome back to Face the Nation, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=924.3000000000001s)]
*  General and and your former colleagues at CENTCOM, extremely busy over these last few [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=931.3s)]
*  hours from the operation. As you've heard it described, what are the questions that [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=936.3s)]
*  come to your mind about Midnight Hammer and being able to assess its success? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=942.74s)]
*  So it looks like it was a successful operation from what we know now. It'll take a little [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=949.06s)]
*  while to build the battle damage assessment, and that'll come out here in the next in the [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=953.02s)]
*  days ahead, and we'll get a much better picture. But I think we've done significant damage, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=957.06s)]
*  significant, perhaps irreversible damage to the Iranian nuclear program. I think right [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=961.26s)]
*  now, though, at CENTCOM, everybody is focused on the next step. And the next step will be [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=966.7399999999999s)]
*  will there be an Iranian response? What will that response look like? What can we do to [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=971.38s)]
*  defend our forces, our embassies, our citizens in the region? And what options can we give [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=975.4599999999999s)]
*  the president should we choose to respond as a result of an Iranian attack? So they're [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=980.7399999999999s)]
*  extremely busy down there right now. And what but one of the key things they want to do is [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=984.86s)]
*  you want to make it very clear to Iran that we possess significant combat power in the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=989.1800000000001s)]
*  theater, and we'll be able to use it against them should they attack us. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=994.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, that's that's the hope that they don't do something. Are you surprised that there [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=999.54s)]
*  has been no retaliation in the past few hours? And where would you be looking as an area of [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1003.54s)]
*  concern? There are a lot of Americans who have family members in the region. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1008.7s)]
*  Absolutely, Margaret. So for one thing, I think the Iranian decision making is a little [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1011.42s)]
*  crippled right now because of the loss of senior leaders. And as you're well aware, the [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1016.2199999999999s)]
*  Iranians don't have good succession planning. People tend to go into jobs and stay there [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1020.78s)]
*  for a long period of time while they enrich themselves and their families. So cronyism is [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1025.26s)]
*  what how you get to the top in their system, which is bad news if suddenly that person is no [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1029.8999999999999s)]
*  longer there, there's no one ready to step in. So the supreme leader probably has trouble [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1034.46s)]
*  talking to people and getting his orders followed. Now, to your question about where they might [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1039.66s)]
*  strike, I think we're certainly vulnerable in Iraq. I think we're certainly vulnerable in Syria. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1043.74s)]
*  And I'm certain that Central Command has done all the things we need to do to harden ourselves [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1048.3s)]
*  against those potential attacks. The same for our other bases across the region. I don't know [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1052.7s)]
*  that it would be localized to the region, though. Iran has long harbored the desire to attack us in [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1057.5s)]
*  the United States. They typically have not been effective when they've done that. We've called [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1063.02s)]
*  them in a couple of plots that are very public that you're well aware of. So I think all those [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1067.66s)]
*  things are on the table. But it may take the Iranians a little while to work through this [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1071.5s)]
*  process, because nobody's excited about going to a meeting in Iran right now. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1076.38s)]
*  Well, you're talking about some of the intelligence actions taken by the Mossad to convene some of [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1082.22s)]
*  these leaders and then kill them all at once. When it comes to what the Secretary of State said [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1088.6200000000001s)]
*  earlier in this program, I asked him specifically if the U.S. would take military action to reopen [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1094.86s)]
*  the Strait of Hormuz if Iran tried to close it. We know that's being talked about, at least in the [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1099.82s)]
*  public space in Iran right now. What would that operation look like? Rubio said they're not [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1105.02s)]
*  exactly talking about it in this moment, but they are worried about the Iranians mining it. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1110.3799999999999s)]
*  The Iranians do have the capability to mine the Strait of Hormuz. We have very good plans to clear [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1117.74s)]
*  that if we had to do it. We work on those plans all the time. It would be a blow to world commerce [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1122.54s)]
*  for a period of time, but at the end, the strait would be cleared. And I'm pretty confident the [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1129.26s)]
*  Iranian Navy would all be sunk at the end of that operation. So the former CIA director, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1133.18s)]
*  Bob Gates, former Secretary of Defense, was on this program very recently. And I asked him about [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1139.1s)]
*  bombing the Iranian nuclear program. He said when he had looked at it, he thought it would at best [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1144.54s)]
*  delay Iran's nuclear ambitions, not end them. You have looked at this problem set in great detail. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1150.62s)]
*  Do you agree that military force is not enough to end the program? Ultimately, you need a policy [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1157.82s)]
*  decision from Iran to end the nuclear program. So I think the Secretary is right in that position. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1164.9399999999998s)]
*  Now, if you don't get a policy decision from Iran, you've got to commit yourself perhaps to [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1172.06s)]
*  revisiting striking the nuclear program as the Iranians begin to spread out and continue to [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1176.3s)]
*  pursue the nuclear option. Here's the one thing, though. We have pretty good knowledge of what goes [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1182.46s)]
*  on in Iran, and that good knowledge is going to continue. So they're not likely to be able to do [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1186.1399999999999s)]
*  something in secret that would suddenly creep up on us. We tend to keep very close track of this. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1191.26s)]
*  But it comes up again and again in the concern, as we were talking about with our lawmakers, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1198.1399999999999s)]
*  this creeping towards a broader war, this creeping towards America getting drawn in to a war that [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1202.38s)]
*  Israel started to take out Iran's nuclear program. I'm not asking about the intent of the state [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1209.5s)]
*  itself, but what is the end goal here? How do you judge success? Have you even heard the Israeli [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1216.7800000000002s)]
*  government or the U.S. government say what success is? Well, I think we've been pretty clear that we [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1222.5400000000002s)]
*  don't want Iran to possess a nuclear weapon. They're close to possessing a nuclear weapon. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1229.42s)]
*  I heard all the exchanges back and forth with the other guests on your show this morning about how [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1233.18s)]
*  close they might or might not have been. But I think that's the one absolutely non-negotiable [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1237.5s)]
*  thing here. And you can get that through an Iranian policy decision to not pursue a nuclear weapon, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1241.9s)]
*  or you can get that through removal of that capability to such a level that they can't do it. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1246.14s)]
*  The second case is not the preferable case, obviously. But there are ways to do this. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1251.18s)]
*  The one thing I would add about the strike that occurred here over the last few hours, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1256.46s)]
*  it was carefully crafted, narrowly designed against the nuclear program to give Iran room [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1259.98s)]
*  to maneuver, diplomatic room to maneuver if they want to seek a way out. So I think that was very [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1266.38s)]
*  clever. Let's see what happens. The principal goal of Iranian statecraft is today, as it has always [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1271.18s)]
*  been, survival of the regime. Under certain of these scenarios, if you go forward and the war [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1277.42s)]
*  widens, I think the survival of the Iranian state is very much on the table. And that's something [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1281.98s)]
*  they're going to want to avoid, Margaret. But as you were just saying, there's no clear [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1287.1s)]
*  succession plan that the U.S. knew of, at least recently, and they can't get a hold of the boss. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1291.26s)]
*  He's in a bunker. So how do you actually get a policy decision? And then can orders actually be [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1296.3s)]
*  given? So it's a very difficult time for Iran right now. I acknowledge all your points. But [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1302.22s)]
*  the commanding remains alive, at least as far as I know. He remains alive. He's probably having [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1310.46s)]
*  trouble having meetings. He's probably having trouble getting his orders followed. But he still [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1315.5s)]
*  asserts that he's in charge as of a couple of days ago. And I don't think we've made any [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1319.6599999999999s)]
*  effort to strike him nor have the Israelis. Yeah. Well, right. And CBS had been reporting that [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1324.1399999999999s)]
*  President Trump advised the Israelis not to take out the Supreme Leader. We'll leave it there, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1330.3s)]
*  and we'll be right back. That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1336.14s)]
*  Until next week, for Face the Nation, I'm Margaret Brennan. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgygJPvN3YY&t=1341.26s)]
