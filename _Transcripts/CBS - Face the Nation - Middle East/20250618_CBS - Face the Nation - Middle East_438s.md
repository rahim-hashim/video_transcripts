# Former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman discusses Israel-Iran conflict
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs)
*  I want to bring in Wendy Sherman, who served several high ranking positions in the Obama [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=0.0s)]
*  State Department. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=4.96s)]
*  It was a key part of that team negotiating with the Iranian government about deterring [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=5.96s)]
*  and slowing down and making available for international inspection its nuclear program. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=12.8s)]
*  Wendy, I'm very glad you're with us. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=18.32s)]
*  This feels like a perilous moment in the region and for the United States. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=20.8s)]
*  Does it to you? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=25.72s)]
*  It does to me as well. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=27.76s)]
*  I think it's a very dangerous moment. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=28.76s)]
*  I think both Holly and Charlie gave a great summary of what's going on. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=30.92s)]
*  I think there are a couple of things that we all have to be aware of. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  What's the end game here? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=38.68s)]
*  Even if the United States uses what's called the MOP, the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=40.72s)]
*  to try to destroy Fordow, we don't know whether it actually will destroy Fordow and all the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  enriched uranium that is there. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  We can't bomb away knowledge, so we may set back Iran's program, but it doesn't mean [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=55.2s)]
*  they won't recreate it and try to do it secretly and underground. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  We don't know what is really enough for the prime minister of Israel, what would be enough [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=65.2s)]
*  for the president of the United States, and whether in fact, as Charlie pointed out, not [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=71.36s)]
*  only those 40,000 military personnel in the region, but there are American citizens all [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=78.16s)]
*  over the region visiting, touring, probably two or 300,000 Americans in Israel alone. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=83.96s)]
*  There is a lot at stake here. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=92.12s)]
*  I think it's important the president is putting assets in the region because if he does take [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=94.0s)]
*  action, we better be prepared for retaliation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=99.0s)]
*  That can be terrorist actions. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=102.56s)]
*  That can be cyber attacks. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=104.32s)]
*  That can be the use of drones. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=106.12s)]
*  That can be the remaining missiles that Iran has. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  There are several other things that they may use their proxies to undertake. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=111.94000000000001s)]
*  So there's a lot at stake here, a lot that is unknown, a lot that is very dangerous for [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=117.94000000000001s)]
*  the United States, and the entire Muslim world may be up in arms, depending upon what we do. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=123.34s)]
*  Wendy, I want to read something that just came across about a half an hour ago out of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=131.82s)]
*  London. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=135.62s)]
*  Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, put his cabinet on alert for a possible U.S. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=137.34s)]
*  attack on Iran. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=142.54s)]
*  British officials said the situation was, quote, grave and volatile when the prime minister's [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=143.94s)]
*  team discussed whether the president, meaning President Trump, might seek to strike Iran's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=148.58s)]
*  nuclear facilities from the joint U.S.-U.K. airbase at Diego Garcia. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=153.58s)]
*  Interpret what I just read to you based on your experience with the United Kingdom diplomacy [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=159.66s)]
*  in general to our audience. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=165.34s)]
*  I would say Prime Minister Starmer is trying to be prepared for any eventuality. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=167.34s)]
*  It's probably a prudent thing for him to do, but it certainly does add to my nervous making [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=174.17999999999998s)]
*  about what might be coming our way. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=180.06s)]
*  The president, as we know, likes to act on instinct. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=182.66s)]
*  But when you are going to take this kind of military action, if he does, you can't do [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=187.1s)]
*  it on instinct. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=191.94s)]
*  You have to be prepared. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=192.94s)]
*  You have to know what the first, second, third effects are going to be of such action. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=195.18s)]
*  You have to prepare for all of them. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=200.46s)]
*  It's just now that the U.S. and Israel is providing, perhaps, charter jets or ships [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=202.58s)]
*  that can take Americans out of Israel. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=208.74s)]
*  That kind of planning should have been going on for some time, given that Israel's been [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=211.16000000000003s)]
*  under attack for five days now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=215.22000000000003s)]
*  So we are in a very tough place, Major, very tough. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=217.58s)]
*  Wendy, how do you evaluate what we know, maybe more importantly, what we don't know actually [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=222.58s)]
*  about Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon and its ability to deliver it? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=230.26000000000002s)]
*  Look, Major, none of us want Iran to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=235.58s)]
*  All of us which wish for it to and all the nuclear facilities didn't exist. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=241.54000000000002s)]
*  So I think we're all on the same page. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=247.62s)]
*  The question is, how do you get to the best outcome? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=249.34s)]
*  President Obama actually is the one who commissioned and deployed that massive ordnance penetrator [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=254.18s)]
*  because he wanted Iran to know while we were negotiating that if that negotiation failed, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=260.94s)]
*  he was prepared to take whatever military action would be necessary to ensure that Iran [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=267.34000000000003s)]
*  never had a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  The deal that we got really had the most extensive monitoring and verification, didn't [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=274.98s)]
*  allow Iran to enrich uranium above 3.67% and really constrained its stockpile and many [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=281.02000000000004s)]
*  other elements of its program. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=288.94s)]
*  And it gave us eyes and ears on what was going on and a channel of communications with the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=291.14000000000004s)]
*  Iranians. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=296.66s)]
*  President Trump decided to leave that deal. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=298.1s)]
*  And that is why we are where we are today with President Trump now having to make an [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=300.7s)]
*  incredibly difficult decision, not only for the security of America, but the security [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=305.46s)]
*  of the world. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=312.82s)]
*  I'm glad you summarize what was in the nuclear deal negotiated by President Obama because [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=315.82s)]
*  it may be an off-ramp here. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=320.74s)]
*  The president has said, and so have his close advisors, that they are open to the prospect [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=322.34s)]
*  of a civilian nuclear program in Iran provided it does not highly enrich the material and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=328.70000000000005s)]
*  that can be verified by international inspectors. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=336.20000000000005s)]
*  That sounds very close to what you just summarized and may, and I underscore that word, may be [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=339.5s)]
*  an off-ramp. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=345.22s)]
*  I hope there is a diplomatic off-ramp. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=347.46000000000004s)]
*  I think one of the errors here, quite frankly, Major, is the president set out a deadline [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=349.58000000000004s)]
*  which he likes to do and says, let's get a deal in 60 days or we'll see what we do next. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=354.22s)]
*  You cannot negotiate this technical deal in 60 days. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=360.54s)]
*  And the president went back and forth. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=366.06s)]
*  Would Iran have to dismantle its entire program or just as you just said, ensure that it had [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=369.02000000000004s)]
*  very low levels of enrichment under verification and monitoring? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=374.5s)]
*  If you want to completely dismantle the program, I don't believe that Iran will ever agree [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=379.54s)]
*  to having no enrichment because it believes it has that right under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=384.21999999999997s)]
*  Treaty. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=389.5s)]
*  We don't believe that, but they do and many of our European countries and allies believe [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=390.21999999999997s)]
*  that the NPT gives a country that right for peaceful civil nuclear programming. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=396.78s)]
*  So given the pride that Iran has, that it's a resistance economy, that it had its revolution [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=402.78s)]
*  in 1979, I think it won't back away from that. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=409.41999999999996s)]
*  But we'll see what they might be willing to do given how much Israel has degraded and [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=413.82s)]
*  decapitated their military, how they have diminished Hezbollah, Hamas, Syria militia [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=420.06s)]
*  and put Iran absolutely in a weaker position. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=427.58s)]
*  Wendy Sherman, thanks as always for your time, expertise and perspective. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=432.53999999999996s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=435.82s)]
*  Thank you, Major. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW8_zk1WQhs&t=437.26s)]
