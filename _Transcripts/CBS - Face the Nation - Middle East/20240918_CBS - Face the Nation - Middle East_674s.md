# White House addresses reports of exploding devices in Lebanon, Gaza cease-fire talks
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE)
*  We want to get you live to the White House right now where National Security Communications [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=0.0s)]
*  Advisor John Kirby is speaking with reporters about the exploding walkie-talkies in Lebanon [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=4.96s)]
*  targeting Hezbollah. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=9.8s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=10.8s)]
*  To prevent the conflict from escalating, we still believe, for instance, that there is [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=11.8s)]
*  a diplomatic path forward, particularly up near Lebanon. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=18.16s)]
*  And we still believe that while it is increasingly difficult and we are certainly no closer to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=23.84s)]
*  finality that we believe a ceasefire deal and a negotiation to get the hostages out [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=30.88s)]
*  is still the best outcome and we're going to keep pursuing that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=38.56s)]
*  But how do these events move forward any diplomatic solution here? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  It's difficult for me to stand up here, Gabe, and tell you exactly how incidents over the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=45.06s)]
*  last couple of days are going to affect outcomes in the next few days. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=48.92s)]
*  All I can tell you is we're still putting our shoulder to the wheel to get the hostages [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  home and get a ceasefire in place, as daunting as that is today. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=58.64s)]
*  And we are still involved in intensive diplomacy to try to prevent a second front from opening [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  up on that border with Lebanon. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=67.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  Given the rhetoric and the attacks in the last few days, it seems like a full-out conflict [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  isn't at all at this point. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=76.92s)]
*  Do you agree with that assessment? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=77.92s)]
*  And is the U.S. government preparing for an evacuation of American citizens in Lebanon? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=78.92s)]
*  I think we've learned through experience, particularly over now, what's going on almost [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=81.92s)]
*  a year here, that nothing is inevitable when it comes to that particular part of the world [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  and this particular conflict. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=94.04s)]
*  And we're going to, as I said to Gabe, we're going to do everything we can to see if we [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=95.44s)]
*  can end it and get those hostages home. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  And your second question was evacuation. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=102.4s)]
*  I don't have anything with respect to evacuation preparations to talk about. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=105.16s)]
*  I mean, that's a better question really put to the State Department. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=110.24s)]
*  I think you know, Laura, particularly covering the Pentagon, we have on the shelf, we have [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  evacuation plans available for places all over the world. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  But I wouldn't lead that to believe that we're in a moment now where we think we need to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=124.12s)]
*  imminently call for that or act on that right now. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=129.64s)]
*  What has been the impact of the latest attacks on the potential for a ceasefire deal in Gaza? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=131.96s)]
*  I think it's too soon to know. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=136.88s)]
*  If what happened over the last couple of days is going to have any effect on where we are [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=140.44s)]
*  with a ceasefire deal, sadly, we aren't any closer to that now than we were even a week [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  ago. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=151.92s)]
*  So it's difficult to see any immediate impact of these incidents, but I think it's just [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=152.92s)]
*  too soon to know in general. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=158.72s)]
*  I think officials have said 90 percent there. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=159.72s)]
*  Is that still the case? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=162.04s)]
*  I think in terms of the agreed framework and the language, that's still the case. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=163.92s)]
*  The framework has been agreed to. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=168.0s)]
*  The major architecture of the deal had been agreed to by both sides. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=169.36s)]
*  But as we said, once you get down to nil and over that last 10 percent and you're in that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  kind of horse trade, it gets real hard and the details get real specific. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=177.4s)]
*  And that's where we have run into some resistance. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=180.96s)]
*  And we're not any closer today than we were a few days ago. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=185.08s)]
*  CBS News at least has learned that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke yesterday with [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=189.56s)]
*  the Israeli Defense Minister two different times. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=195.36s)]
*  You've been told no specifics were given about the operation that happened yesterday. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=199.28s)]
*  Was there any heads up given yesterday that there would be more attacks in Lebanon today? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=205.28s)]
*  I'd refer you to the Defense Department to speak to conversations that the Secretary [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=210.48s)]
*  had with Minister Gallant. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=214.88s)]
*  As I said, there was no U.S. involvement in either of these incidents. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=217.6s)]
*  And I have nothing to do with it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=221.8s)]
*  And that's one thing, though. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=222.8s)]
*  But awareness that it was coming is another. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=223.8s)]
*  I recognize the question. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=225.24s)]
*  I have nothing more to add. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=226.4s)]
*  If you're someone who owns a pager like this that's been blown up in Lebanon in recent [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=227.88s)]
*  days, whether it was made by the Taiwanese company or the Hungarian company that may [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=232.96s)]
*  have had a licensing deal with them, should you be concerned it could blow up? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=236.88s)]
*  Again, Ed, I have nothing more to add on this. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  Our sources have confirmed to us it's been widely reported that Israel is responsible [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  for this, but notably you still won't say that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=247.36s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=250.0s)]
*  Is it because that's not your assessment or because you don't support what they're doing [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=251.0s)]
*  here? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=254.12s)]
*  It's because I don't have anything more to add on this issue. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=255.12s)]
*  As I said, there was no U.S. involvement, and I'm not going to go beyond that today. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=257.12s)]
*  Then let me ask this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=260.32s)]
*  These kinds of tactics, blowing up pagers and walkie talkies, is this type of warfare [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=261.32s)]
*  acceptable to the United States? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=265.84s)]
*  Again, Mary, I appreciate the question. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=267.52s)]
*  I'm simply not going to be able to address these incidents over the last couple of days [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=269.44s)]
*  in any level of detail one way or another. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=273.0s)]
*  OK, let me try one other thing. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=275.76s)]
*  Everyone keeps urging all parties involved not to escalate this. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=278.12s)]
*  Isn't this an escalation already? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=281.96s)]
*  Isn't this Israel doing exactly what you've been warning them not to do? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=283.56s)]
*  Again, I'm not going to speak to the details of these incidents. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=288.32s)]
*  I understand that's frustrating. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  I get it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=292.12s)]
*  I understand where all your questions are coming from. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=293.12s)]
*  They're all valid. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=295.16s)]
*  They're all fair. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=296.16s)]
*  I'm just not going to get into this. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=297.16s)]
*  I will add, if I could, and restate a little bit to what I said to Gabe, we still don't [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=298.16s)]
*  want to see an escalation of any kind. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=303.48s)]
*  We don't believe that the way to solve where we're at in this crisis is by additional military [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=306.68s)]
*  operations at all. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  We still believe that the best way to prevent escalation, to prevent another front from [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=320.28s)]
*  opening up in Lebanon, is through diplomacy, which is why Mr. Hoxtein was over in the region [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  this week. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=329.36s)]
*  And we're still going to pursue those kinds of outcomes. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=330.8s)]
*  If a state actor was involved in any way in what took place in Lebanon, is that acceptable [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=336.24s)]
*  behavior by a government? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=342.72s)]
*  That's a great hypothetical, Trevor, that I'm simply not going to engage. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=345.2s)]
*  So that's not the case that it was a state actor? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=349.52s)]
*  I have nothing more to add on these incidents. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=352.08s)]
*  I understand the question, but I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals or speculate about [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=354.0s)]
*  what did or didn't happen or who might be responsible. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=358.08s)]
*  Is there any current intelligence assessment as to who was responsible? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=362.84s)]
*  I'm not going to get into intelligence estimates and assessments from here either. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=366.91999999999996s)]
*  The Secretary of State Blinken expressed frustration at the escalations in remarks earlier today, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=371.47999999999996s)]
*  saying it threatens to slow it, to stop a ceasefire deal. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  Is that the White House's assessment as well, that it's close to being stopped or derailed? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  As I said earlier, I think looking at the last couple of days, it's just a little too [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=386.84s)]
*  soon to know what kind of impact those incidents are going to have in the region at large, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=394.23999999999995s)]
*  particularly when it comes to the tensions up at the border with Lebanon. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=403.08s)]
*  On the ceasefire deal and trying to get both sides back to the table, we're still working [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=407.44s)]
*  at that. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=412.9s)]
*  Nothing's changed. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=413.9s)]
*  We're still trying to get that done. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=414.9s)]
*  We understand that even before the incidents of the last couple of days, doing that was [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=416.82s)]
*  real hard, that there wasn't a lot of momentum to be had there or inertia. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=420.94s)]
*  We recognize that, but we're still working to try to see if we can get that done because [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=426.65999999999997s)]
*  we still believe the best way to get those hostages home is through a negotiated arrangement. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=429.73999999999995s)]
*  On the tensions with Lebanon, again, too soon to know what these incidents are going to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  to the already high tensions between Israel and Hezbollah up at that border, the blue [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=440.7s)]
*  line specifically. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=446.62s)]
*  All I can tell you is even as recently as a couple of days ago, Amos Hoxdeen, our envoy, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=448.3s)]
*  was in the region having discussions to do everything we can from a diplomatic perspective [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=453.82s)]
*  to prevent those tensions from escalating into all-out conflict. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=457.53999999999996s)]
*  I have one more just on Wilmington this weekend. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=460.5s)]
*  Does the president intend to press Prime Minister Modi on human rights abuses while they're [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=464.3s)]
*  talking one-on-one? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=470.38s)]
*  There's not a conversation that he has with foreign leaders where he doesn't talk about [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=471.38s)]
*  the importance of respecting human and civil rights, and that includes with Prime Minister [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=476.18s)]
*  Modi. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=480.74s)]
*  He did when the prime minister was here in the United States, and I'm sure that as appropriate [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=481.74s)]
*  he'll do going forward. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=486.46000000000004s)]
*  I'm not going to get ahead of the conversation, but he never shies away from talking about [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=487.46000000000004s)]
*  over human and civil rights anywhere in the world. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=492.38s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=495.38s)]
*  And then you said a lot of time, especially about this region, that it's very important [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=496.38s)]
*  for this administration that the rules of war, international humanitarian law, is being [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=501.73999999999995s)]
*  followed. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=506.58s)]
*  So why won't you make an assessment whether these operations that we're seeing in Lebanon [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=507.58s)]
*  indeed are in accordance with international humanitarian law? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=512.18s)]
*  I can appreciate that you all want answers to these questions, and you want them now. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=516.14s)]
*  I get that. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=520.94s)]
*  We're talking about incidents that allegedly happened today, apparently happened today, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=521.94s)]
*  and some that happened yesterday. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=526.3000000000001s)]
*  I'm just not going to get into intelligence assessments one way or another about this. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=528.1800000000001s)]
*  And I would also add that as we have said from the very beginning, Israel has a right [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=534.1s)]
*  to defend itself, how they do so matters to us, and we don't shy away from having those [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=541.3000000000001s)]
*  kinds of conversations with the Israelis as appropriate. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=546.1400000000001s)]
*  So you're saying Israel is behind these operations? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=549.38s)]
*  I'm not saying that. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=552.06s)]
*  Do you think that Israel, whoever committed this attack, is undermining U.S. efforts at [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=555.9399999999999s)]
*  avoiding an escalation in the region? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=561.5799999999999s)]
*  And if so, what is the next move to try and prevent that from happening? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=564.38s)]
*  We're going to keep at the work of intense diplomacy to see what we can do to de-escalate, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=569.26s)]
*  to try to prevent this from becoming a bigger conflict than it already has. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=573.66s)]
*  One more. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=578.78s)]
*  Over the weekend, the Palestinian ministry in Gaza submitted a report with the names, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=579.78s)]
*  IDs, ages of 34,000 people who have been killed since October 7. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=586.34s)]
*  Over 7,000 more whose identities have not been verified. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=592.3000000000001s)]
*  The first 14 pages of the report are babies under the age of one and two people over the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=596.6600000000001s)]
*  age of 100. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=603.4200000000001s)]
*  Has the White House seen that report? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=605.2199999999999s)]
*  And do you have any comments beyond far too many Palestinians have been killed in this conflict? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=607.2199999999999s)]
*  Let me take the question for you so I can get you back a good substantive answer. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=613.6999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if we've seen that report. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=617.42s)]
*  I haven't, but that doesn't mean that somebody here hasn't, so why don't you let me take [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=619.0999999999999s)]
*  that back and get you a better answer. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=622.5799999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=624.26s)]
*  All right, there's just so many ways you can ask a question and try and get an answer. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=627.26s)]
*  We're listening to the press call there speaking to John Kirby, the White House National Security [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=631.14s)]
*  Communications Advisor. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=635.18s)]
*  And Kirby says when it comes to the explosions of devices in Lebanon that the U.S. was not [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=637.1s)]
*  involved in any of the incidents that happened today or yesterday. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=643.34s)]
*  He insisted that the ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas is the [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=647.34s)]
*  best way to end the war in Gaza. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=653.66s)]
*  And the journalists there tried to press him on the topic and said that it's just too [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=657.18s)]
*  soon to know if the exploding devices incidents will have any impact on ongoing peace talks [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=660.78s)]
*  or instability in the Middle East at large. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=667.3s)]
*  We'll continue to listen in to what he does and doesn't say there at the White House. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASl7SjKIDE&t=670.3s)]
