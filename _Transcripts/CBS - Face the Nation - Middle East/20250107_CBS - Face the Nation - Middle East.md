# Pressure mounts for a ceasefire and hostage deal in the Middle East
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [January 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg)
*  During Tuesday's press conference at Mar-a-Lago, President-elect Donald Trump, alongside his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=0.0s)]
*  Middle East envoy, demanded the release of hostages in Gaza before his inauguration on [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=3.8200000000000003s)]
*  January 20th. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=8.4s)]
*  If those hostages aren't back, I don't want to hurt your negotiation. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=10.32s)]
*  If they're not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=15.0s)]
*  East. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=19.84s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Rami Inosensio has more on the status of ceasefire and hostage [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=20.84s)]
*  negotiations. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=25.48s)]
*  Hi there. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=26.48s)]
*  One new interesting development is a potential plan for after the war ends. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=27.96s)]
*  The United Arab Emirates has reportedly been in discussion with the United States, Israel [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=33.72s)]
*  and other nations for some kind of joint temporary administration of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  This is according to Reuters. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=46.2s)]
*  And this partnership would oversee the governance, security and reconstruction of the entire [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=47.2s)]
*  Strip. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=53.72s)]
*  The plan would continue until the Palestinian Authority, which was driven out of Gaza back [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=54.96s)]
*  in 2007, is so-called reformed and then able to take over. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=59.48s)]
*  Reuters also reports this plan doesn't have detail yet and hasn't been adopted by any [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=64.16s)]
*  government, but it is a possible roadmap for Gaza's future. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=70.0s)]
*  So it's one to keep an eye on. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=74.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, ceasefire talks in Doha do carry on with just 13 days left to go until the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=76.08s)]
*  end of the Biden administration. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=81.6s)]
*  And the sticking point, it appears, to be whether the 34 hostages on the list that Hamas [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=83.66s)]
*  revealed yesterday, which we reported, are alive or dead. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=89.5s)]
*  That's coming from Israeli, Hamas and Qatari officials. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=94.38s)]
*  Israel's government wants guarantees they're alive. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=98.38s)]
*  But after 15 months of war, that has shattered the Strip with bombings happening each day [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=100.74s)]
*  and with about 300 people killed. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=107.46s)]
*  In the first week of this year, one Hamas official claimed that no one knows the condition [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=110.36s)]
*  of all of those hostages, and so they're demanding a four-day truce to try and figure that out. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=116.12s)]
*  U.S. envoys Bretton McGurk and Amos Hochstein are still in the region, so that signals that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=122.12s)]
*  talks while not high level are still going on. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=127.4s)]
*  Technically, if we saw Israel's spy chief David Barnea or CIA Director William Burns [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  appear, then that could mean an agreement is close. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=135.62s)]
*  Remy Innocentio, CBS News, Tel Aviv. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXV_ln0Tkg&t=139.6s)]
