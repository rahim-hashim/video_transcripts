# State Department confirms U.S. warned Israel of consequences if Gaza aid doesn't increase
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno)
*  All right, so our monitors now take us back to the State Department where Matthew Miller is taking questions on US support for Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's listen it [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=6.66s)]
*  So [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=9.36s)]
*  And I expect your questions will fully cover everything give me the chance to expound on all of those things [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=12.48s)]
*  All right. Well, let's start with let's start with this warning to the Israelis [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=18.5s)]
*  Improving humanitarian aid [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=24.88s)]
*  Deliveries to Gaza what can you tell us about this a few things? So first? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=26.88s)]
*  Secretary did write along with his along with Secretary of Defense Austin to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=32.2s)]
*  the defense minister of Israel Yoha Lant and the minister for strategic affairs Ron Dermer on [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=37.16s)]
*  Sunday to make clear our concerns about the levels of humanitarian assistance that have been making it into Gaza. This was a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=43.16s)]
*  Letter we consider to be a private diplomatic communication that we did not intend to make public from our side [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=51.4s)]
*  Now that it is public. I'm happy to confirm it and speak to it to some extent [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=56.64s)]
*  I think you have to put this letter in the context of our [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  ongoing and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=65.2s)]
*  long-lasting communications and concerns about the levels of humanitarian assistance that have made it to Palestinian civilians if you go back to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  April the secretary [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=74.56s)]
*  Wrote at the time to minister Galaant to make clear that we had seen the levels of humanitarian assistance [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=76.4s)]
*  Plateau and then after they plateaued start to decline and made clear that at the time that the levels were unacceptable [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  And that we needed to see Israel implement changes they did make changes the changes that they made caused [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  humanitarian assistance to increase [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=98.28s)]
*  We got up to somewhere between 300 to 400 trucks going in on some days to Gaza [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=100.48s)]
*  but the thing that the secretary also made clear at the time is that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=106.0s)]
*  The increase couldn't be a one-off that it needed to be sustained and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=110.2s)]
*  What we have seen over the past few months is that the level of humanitarian assistance has not been sustained in fact [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  It has fallen by over 50% from where it was at its peak [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=120.44000000000001s)]
*  so the secretary along with secretary Austin thought it was appropriate to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=123.56s)]
*  Make clear to the governor of Israel that there are [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  Changes that they need to make again to see that the level of assistance making it into Gaza [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  Comes back up from the very very low levels that it is at today and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=136.84s)]
*  The consequence if they don't do that is what so I'm not going to speak to that today [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=141.52s)]
*  Obviously we made clear when we released our report that was mandated under National Security [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=147.16s)]
*  memorandum 20 that there are [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=152.68s)]
*  Provisions under US law that require us to make certain certifications and to make those certifications we have to see that Israel is not arbitrarily [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=155.68s)]
*  denying [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=163.24s)]
*  Humanitarian assistance making it into Gaza when the secretary [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=165.0s)]
*  Made his conclusions under that report in April. He did so [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  Based on the changes that we had seen them put into place and the increased levels of humanitarian assistance [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  But of course that those levels of humanitarian assistance have to be sustainable [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=179.88s)]
*  Yeah, but [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=184.67999999999998s)]
*  But what's the what's the consequence there are implications under US law under policy that I'm not going to speak to here largely because [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=189.0s)]
*  We hope that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=197.72s)]
*  Israel makes the changes that the secretary outlined in the letter [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=199.16s)]
*  we have seen Israel make changes before and when they make changes humanitarian assistance can increase and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=203.72s)]
*  We have seen Israel just in the past few months work with humanitarian organizations to implement a polio [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=209.44000000000003s)]
*  vaccination campaign inside Gaza, so we know that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=215.16000000000003s)]
*  It's possible to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza. We know it can be done. We know that the various [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  Logistical and bureaucratic obstacles can be surmounted [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=225.68s)]
*  and so it is a come incumbent upon the government Israel to surmount those challenges and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=228.88000000000002s)]
*  Get assistance in [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=234.72000000000003s)]
*  Obviously under US law as assistance [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=239.08s)]
*  Is there [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  Under scrutiny so I don't want to deal with any hypotheticals you are right that it's just a it's just a plain reading of US law [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=246.16000000000003s)]
*  if you look at the provisions of US law that we are required to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=251.88000000000002s)]
*  conduct assessments and find that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=256.8s)]
*  recipients of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=260.04s)]
*  US military assistance do not [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=261.44s)]
*  arbitrarily deny or impede the provisioning of US humanitarian assistance [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=264.16s)]
*  That's just the law and we of course will follow the law [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=268.8s)]
*  but our hope is that Israel will make the changes that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=271.2s)]
*  we have outlined and that we have recommended and that the result of those changes will be a [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=275.36s)]
*  Dramatic increase in humanitarian assistance. Ultimately, we are focused on the bottom line here. It's just it [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=281.48s)]
*  Humanitarian as a humanitarian assistance had been low the changes that we had recommended had gotten it up and those those [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  Levels have not been sustained and so we need to see further changes on by the government of Israel [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=295.02s)]
*  I mean obviously the timing of this [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=299.64s)]
*  To what extent is that a factor 30 days from now would be after the US election [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=307.14s)]
*  It's been a year since the conflict has been ongoing. The president's repeatedly warned Israel about [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=312.06s)]
*  About assistance about civilian casualties with at best mixed results sometimes [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=318.34000000000003s)]
*  This happened in just 30 days before the election and to what extent was the election is not a factor at all [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=324.66s)]
*  The the bottom line is we felt it was appropriate if we are making clear to [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=329.74s)]
*  The government of Israel that there are these changes that need to be implemented that we give them an appropriate period of time to implement [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=334.7s)]
*  It let them invent them. I didn't think it was appropriate to send a letter and just say this has to happen overnight [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=341.42s)]
*  We give a make clear there's a short window in which we want to see change [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=345.46s)]
*  Changes because the humanitarian situation is so dire on the ground, but it is appropriate to give them some time to work through [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=349.16s)]
*  The different issues and find ways to get the level of trucks get the level of food water medicine [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=357.0s)]
*  Back up to acceptable levels [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=365.64s)]
*  So this 620 I for an assistance act [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=367.8s)]
*  Actually doesn't have the word arbitrarily you say it's the law but the the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=371.72s)]
*  NSM 20 which is a memorandum has the word arbitrarily. So the Foreign Assistance Act says [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=378.44s)]
*  When it's made known to the president that the government of such country prohibits or otherwise [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=386.8s)]
*  Restricts directly or indirectly the transport of delivery of United States humanitarian assistance. It does not have arbitrarily [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=391.56s)]
*  so given you are already saying humanitarian assistance is very low and [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=398.64s)]
*  Putting in front of Israel a bunch of concrete measures on how to improve it [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=405.16s)]
*  Why are you waiting for another 30 days to implement the law? Because we believe it's appropriate to give them a chance to cure the problem and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  International humanitarian law does make exceptions it for [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=418.92s)]
*  Certain for I'll give you an example dual use items is a good example [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=422.76s)]
*  If there are the dual use items that legitimately could use could be used as a military purpose [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=426.2s)]
*  Of course governments are required to let those dual use items in which is not to say that they can use that [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=432.8s)]
*  Exception as a blanket restriction on anything that could be used as a dual use item [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=438.4s)]
*  For example, if there are military movements happening in a certain period of time [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=442.47999999999996s)]
*  Governments can restrict the provision of humanitarian aid during that period because obviously you wouldn't want to put humanitarian workers at jeopardy [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=447.0s)]
*  So it is it's not it is not accurate to say that there are can be no restrictions. It's that those restrictions ultimately can't block [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=453.4s)]
*  Civilians from getting the humanitarian access that they need and that is what we were focused on doing [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=461.6s)]
*  And so we think it's appropriate ultimate. Let me just say ultimately what we want to see here is results [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=465.68s)]
*  This isn't about making a rhetorical statement. It's not about making any kind of threats [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  it's about seeing the situation reversed and so that the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=474.24s)]
*  Civilians in Gaza who are not getting adequate access to food and medicine and other humanitarian goods today [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=477.76000000000005s)]
*  Actually see as a result of our efforts a change in their daily lives [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=483.92s)]
*  And that's what we're focused on achieving and that's what we are trying to achieve through this letter [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=487.98s)]
*  Sure, but I guess what I'm trying to get at and I'll ask you again is like we've been at this for over a year now [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=492.70000000000005s)]
*  You have made these warnings [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=498.86s)]
*  Dozens of times if not more from this podium secretary has done it president of United States has done it and yet we're here [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=501.14000000000004s)]
*  Other outlets have reported that Reuters has reported all the way back in April that [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=509.86s)]
*  Officials from this department have assessed in internal memos that Israel quote is [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=515.8599999999999s)]
*  persistently and arbitrarily [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=522.8599999999999s)]
*  impeding aid in Gaza, so [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=525.5s)]
*  If the law is already being like I mean if it's already doing it. Why is the United States waiting? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=528.38s)]
*  So first of all [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=535.74s)]
*  That is not [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=537.9399999999999s)]
*  So we've been over this before I know from this podium [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=539.3399999999999s)]
*  There are people that reach that conclusion and there are people inside this building who reach the opposite conclusion [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=541.6999999999999s)]
*  So I think it's important to state that for the record that when you have a difficult [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=546.78s)]
*  Situations as it's not uncommon for people to reach different assessments [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=550.54s)]
*  Ultimately if you look at the the last year and our record of working to get humanitarian assistance [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=554.62s)]
*  Into Gaza what you've seen is the US intervening beaning at critical moments going back to October 12th. Let's not forget that [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=560.66s)]
*  I asked it was October October 16th. So just a few days after October 7th that the secretary [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=568.94s)]
*  Was negotiating with the governor of Israel until 2 in the morning in Tel Aviv to get the first trucks in to Gaza [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=578.34s)]
*  I know you were there and [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=584.1400000000001s)]
*  Over the neck the the coming months have intervened on [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=587.1800000000001s)]
*  multiple occasions when we thought [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=591.1400000000001s)]
*  The levels of assistance getting in weren't sufficient when there were policies that needed to be changed when there are new gates that needed [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=594.54s)]
*  To be opened we have intervened to get that to happen and you have seen those results [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=600.3000000000001s)]
*  You've seen us go from one crossing being open to four crossings being open and that is the result of US intervention now [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=604.3000000000001s)]
*  To answer your question. We have always said that this is an ongoing process and our assessments are ongoing. They're not static [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=611.82s)]
*  They're dynamic. And so when the situation changes [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=618.82s)]
*  Our assessments will change and will act accordingly and that's what we're doing [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=621.9399999999999s)]
*  And how did these real is respond to this letter? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=625.62s)]
*  I they can speak for themselves [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=628.3s)]
*  But I mean have you received any assurances that they will actually take these concrete measures? So I'm just not gonna speak for them [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=630.26s)]
*  Those are private diplomatic conversations. They can speak to their reaction. And one final thing [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=636.26s)]
*  What is your message to the world? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=640.06s)]
*  When they question US credibility in terms of following through because President Biden [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=642.3s)]
*  Made a similar threat to cut off or restrict US military aid in April if Israel [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=647.9399999999999s)]
*  Carried out a major operation in Rafa regardless of what you call that operation [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=654.8199999999999s)]
*  Rafa is now like a wasteland and [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=660.2199999999999s)]
*  We have seen one shipment of 2,000 pound bombs being withheld but everything else [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=663.62s)]
*  billions of dollars worth of [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=669.86s)]
*  Weapons have continued. So what do you say to people? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=672.18s)]
*  You know who question the credibility so [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=676.5400000000001s)]
*  So first of all, I will say without getting into all of the details that not all of the premises [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=679.98s)]
*  Of that question are accurate when it comes to the communications between us and the government of Israel [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=685.02s)]
*  What I will say is look at our track record of intervening to get humanitarian assistance in and look at the fact that [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=690.22s)]
*  When we have seen [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=695.94s)]
*  Levels when we have seen Israel not fall through on the steps that they committed to and when we have seen [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=698.86s)]
*  The results [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=705.1s)]
*  Not measure up to the standards that we expect [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=706.54s)]
*  We have intervened with them to turn those around and that's what we did in April and it wasn't just a letter from the secretary [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=708.98s)]
*  It was also the president [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=715.22s)]
*  making this clear directly to the Prime Minister of Netanyahu that we needed to see changes and [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=716.94s)]
*  That our policy would be dependent on the changes that they made and they made those changes now [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=722.14s)]
*  what we also said is that the changes need to be sustained and the level of humanitarian assistance needed to be sustained and [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=728.1s)]
*  Over time we've seen the level come down [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=734.3399999999999s)]
*  Which is why we are going back in and making clear now that it needs to be reversed [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=736.62s)]
*  You already said one more [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=740.6999999999999s)]
*  At the end of that letter you also talk about [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=743.3s)]
*  Establishing a new channel to raise civilian harm incidents [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=747.2199999999999s)]
*  Which sounds in a way incredible because it's been over a year [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=751.2199999999999s)]
*  so [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=754.8599999999999s)]
*  Can you elaborate a little bit on that effort? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=755.9799999999999s)]
*  What kind of a channel you want to establish and are you saying that like Israelis basically ignored the US in [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=758.5s)]
*  all of the previous [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=766.02s)]
*  Communications when us raised its concern about civilian harm [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=768.46s)]
*  I'm not going to speak to it beyond the language that's in the letter other than to say that [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=772.02s)]
*  We continue to see Israel not taking sufficient steps to address civilian harm and you have to look no further [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=776.62s)]
*  To understand that than the really horrific results over the weekend [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=784.14s)]
*  Does this building see any [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=788.98s)]
*  Inconsistency between sending a sternly worded letter with a 30-day lead time about humanitarian conditions in Gaza to the Israelis well [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=791.5s)]
*  Near simultaneously deploying an advanced anti-missile system with 100 US troops to man it no of course not [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=798.9000000000001s)]
*  we have always we have always made clear that we are committed to the defense of Israel and [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=805.26s)]
*  That's why you saw the president [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=810.1s)]
*  Make the decision that he made which I will let my colleagues at the Pentagon speak to in detail [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=812.34s)]
*  But we've also made clear that [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=816.26s)]
*  there are provisions of US law that we follow and [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=818.5s)]
*  We will always follow those provisions and part of that is expecting that that the Israeli government [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=821.74s)]
*  Fully comply with the requirements under international humanitarian law to make sure that humanitarian assistance gets into Gaza [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=827.86s)]
*  Sure, I mean, and this is retreading territory that that humira and Matt just raised with you [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=834.02s)]
*  But I mean six months ago it was it what there were suspicions that [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=838.26s)]
*  That humanitarian law was not being followed by Israeli forces. So why six months on if the situation is similarly [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=841.5s)]
*  Deplorable do you suspect that situation is meaning so you're right? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=850.94s)]
*  It is a bit of a retread and I hope you will I hope you accept my apology for giving the same answer the same question [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=854.54s)]
*  But no, but I think it is it is important to be clear that it is because we saw the situation change [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=859.06s)]
*  That's that that I mean [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=865.14s)]
*  I think the premise of the question the premise of humerus question is that the situation has been static all along it [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=866.3s)]
*  Hasn't been static when we intervened back in April to set to make clear [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=871.42s)]
*  But the level of humanitarian assistance getting in wasn't sufficient [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=876.06s)]
*  We saw it increase and we saw that increase sustained for a period of time [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=878.9399999999999s)]
*  But then not long enough and it came back down and so we're gonna respond to events as they happen and when [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=883.3s)]
*  Humanitarian assistance [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=891.9799999999999s)]
*  Increases and is an acceptable level [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=893.74s)]
*  You won't see us raising those concerns [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=896.78s)]
*  But when we see the situation on the ground that we've seen over the past few months when we see the level of humanitarian [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=898.74s)]
*  Assistance in September the lowest it has been any month since the war began [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=903.5799999999999s)]
*  It's appropriate for us to intervene in this way and to briefly address the flip side [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=906.78s)]
*  I mean the Israeli argument is that allowing this aid in provides fuel for Hamas. They they run a protection racket [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=910.98s)]
*  They get money they get funds. They you know [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=916.98s)]
*  Essentially they think that taking this step is [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=920.18s)]
*  Effectively choking off Hamas is the US dispute that that is a reason why these ladies are limiting this aid. So [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=922.5s)]
*  There are without a doubt security concerns inside Gaza [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=928.6999999999999s)]
*  That make it difficult to deliver aid that has that has led to the looting of humanitarian assistance in some cases [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=933.26s)]
*  but the answer to that is not to stop the flow of food and water that civilians depend on and that little babies and [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=940.9399999999999s)]
*  Children need to survive that cannot be the answer to that problem [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=948.54s)]
*  the ultimate answer to that problem is to establish a governing authority in [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=952.6999999999999s)]
*  Gaza that can provide safety and security for the Palestinian people of Gaza that can provide safety and security for the deliver [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=959.38s)]
*  delivery of humanitarian assistance [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=967.1s)]
*  That can provide a long-term political path forward as we have been making clear for some time the answer absolutely cannot in any way [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=969.3s)]
*  Be penalizing the innocent civilians who depend on this food water medicine to live [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=976.94s)]
*  All right, you've been listening to the State Department spokesman Matt Miller addressing the US pressure on Israel to boost humanitarian [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=985.42s)]
*  Intervention in Gaza that came in the form of a letter that the US considered a private diplomatic communication [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=992.26s)]
*  The letter not kept public though. We do not know why [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=998.68s)]
*  We do not know who let it out into the public domain [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=1002.74s)]
*  But officials in the US are now having to answer questions about the contents of that communication saying that Israel just isn't doing enough to provide [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=1005.62s)]
*  Humanitarian aid you see Miller there he highlighted over and over and over at points Israel increased assistance [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=1012.1800000000001s)]
*  But they want to make it very clear, especially in this letter that they don't want to be [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=1018.02s)]
*  Accused of being a part of assistance just being a one-off they want sustained [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=1022.26s)]
*  Sustained humanitarian aid so they're pushing for that [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrr6evgJno&t=1026.74s)]
