# Rep. Chip Roy reacts to Trump's Gaza takeover proposal
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg)
*  ALIES AND ADVERSARIES OF THE UNITED STATES ARE WIDELY CRITICIZING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=0.0s)]
*  PROPOSAL TO QUOTE TAKE OVER THE GASA STRIP. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=5.0s)]
*  REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN CHIP ROY JOINS US NOW FROM CAPITAL HILL. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=8.24s)]
*  HE REPRESENTS TEXAS IN ITS 21ST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  CONGRESSMAN, THANKS FOR BEING HERE. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=14.76s)]
*  SO YOU ARE ONE OF THE MORE PROMINENT CONSERVATIVE VOICES IN THE U.S. HOUSE. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=16.84s)]
*  WHAT'S THE REACTION, NOT ONLY OF YOURSELF, BUT OF YOUR COLLEAGUES, TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=20.44s)]
*  HAS PROPOSED? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=23.68s)]
*  Well, we're still listening to the administration and to his team to understand exactly what [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=25.68s)]
*  the plan is. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  We're, you know, strongly behind the president and what he's been doing to actually stand [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=32.24s)]
*  alongside Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=35.84s)]
*  I was proud to get the International Criminal Court sanctions bill through the House. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=37.8s)]
*  Unfortunately, the Senate Democrats rejected it, but we're proud to stand alongside the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=44.64s)]
*  prime minister, stand alongside Israel. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=48.32s)]
*  And now the president has plans for what he wants to do with respect to Gaza. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=50.54s)]
*  We'll listen to those. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=53.6s)]
*  We obviously, you know, don't have any real strong interest in having our military men [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=54.6s)]
*  and women, you know, overseas in dangerous situations. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  He's the commander in chief, and we'll give him the benefit of the doubt to determine [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=61.88s)]
*  what's best for our country. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=64.8s)]
*  And then we'll reserve the right to review it over time. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=65.8s)]
*  But we would make sure that it's in our national security interests and that we're standing [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=68.68s)]
*  alongside our friend Israel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=72.88s)]
*  Is it on the table that you'd be open to considering having U.S. troops serve in Gaza? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=75.4s)]
*  Well, the commander in chief can move men and women in uniform around for national security [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=80.8s)]
*  interests. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=86.84s)]
*  But obviously, if there's anything that's going to be long term, you got to come to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=87.84s)]
*  Congress and figure out what what we're going to do that's in our national security interest. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=89.92s)]
*  You know, I'm not one for the president campaigned against having foreign entanglements abroad. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=94.64s)]
*  I trust the president to make good judgment here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=99.6s)]
*  And again, he's doing what the Biden administration would not do, which is stand directly alongside [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=102.8s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu, stand alongside Israel, stand up against the International [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=108.64s)]
*  Criminal Court. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=113.04s)]
*  Democrats are blocking that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=114.04s)]
*  Chuck Schumer led an effort to block that rather than standing up against their ridiculous, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=115.8s)]
*  lawless pursuit of Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=120.52s)]
*  So I trust President Trump to get this right. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=123.08s)]
*  We'll listen more to their administration about what their plans are. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=125.76s)]
*  Congressman, you've been in politics for a long time. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=129.44s)]
*  You've been a chief of staff as well as a lawmaker. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=132.72s)]
*  You've been close to some of the top republics in the country for over a decade. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=136.44s)]
*  Step back for a second and you look at what President Trump said here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=139.44s)]
*  Is this similar to what he said, for example, on tariffs, where he takes a maximalist position [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  as a way of maybe getting some leverage in a negotiation? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=146.88s)]
*  Is this about nudging Israel along on a certain path, nudging the Arab nations along to maybe [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=150.32s)]
*  accept some people who have been living in Gaza? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=155.96s)]
*  What do you see as the actual big picture here beyond the explicit proposal he made? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=160.04s)]
*  Well, first of all, what you've seen over the last now two weeks and change out of the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=165.0s)]
*  president has been shaking the world because they're actually now seeing leadership again. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=170.68s)]
*  We're seeing what that means in Mexico, having 10,000 Mexican military members up along their [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=174.64s)]
*  northern border, our southern border. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=180.24s)]
*  You've seen what that's meant with Colombia, with Venezuela, and now around the world. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=181.88s)]
*  And now he's engaging here. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=185.56s)]
*  And I think it's I do think it's purposeful. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=186.76s)]
*  He always has a plan. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=188.88s)]
*  But again, he took Prime Minister Netanyahu in and had him as one of his first visits in the White [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=190.32s)]
*  House, if not his first visit with the head of state. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=196.4s)]
*  And so he's making a loud signal to the world after the Abraham Accords, the historic Abraham [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=198.72s)]
*  Accords, that we would have an engagement with Israel to try to continue to grow and develop the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=204.04s)]
*  Middle East relationships. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=209.0s)]
*  Imagine where things would be if we hadn't had the intervening four years where Joe Biden [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=210.32s)]
*  abandoned Prime Minister Netanyahu in Israel. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=214.6s)]
*  We would have built on the Abraham Accords and built on the relationships, having flights from [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=217.12s)]
*  countries all over the Middle East into Israel and having engagement economically and through [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  commerce. So I think this is all a part of his plan to try to engage. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  And again, he'll come present to us what he has in store. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=230.16000000000003s)]
*  But he's two weeks in. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  Let's give him some room to go do his job as president. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  Congressman, let's turn to taxes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=237.56s)]
*  You told reporters today House Republicans are considering, as we've heard for a long time, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=239.36s)]
*  extending the Trump tax cuts for five years, though, instead of 10. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=243.56s)]
*  What other details can you share about the proposal you're working on? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, last year, President Trump was very clear. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  He campaigned against inflation in his inaugural speech in the Dome Room right behind me. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=256.2s)]
*  You know, he mentioned it again that we need to combat inflation by cutting spending. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=261.16s)]
*  That's our goal. Here's to cut spending. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=264.6s)]
*  Scott Besson, his secretary of Treasury, has a 333 plan. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=266.68s)]
*  The last three of that is to reduce deficits to three percent of GDP. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=270.2s)]
*  I think I agree with the secretary. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  I agree with the president. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's what we're standing on. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=277.56s)]
*  We need spending cuts. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=278.76s)]
*  All we're really asking for is the two hundred and fifty billion dollars a year out of seven [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=280.04s)]
*  trillion that we agreed to as a Republican conference over Christmas. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=284.24s)]
*  We think we ought to restore basically the Trump budget from before Covid in twenty twenty [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=288.88s)]
*  five. They would have spent six trillion. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=293.36s)]
*  We're now at seven trillion. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=295.32s)]
*  The American people are tired of it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=296.72s)]
*  They're tired of inflation. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=297.92s)]
*  So we want to have cuts. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=299.12s)]
*  That's it. And so the five year, ten year debate about taxes, I want to make tax cuts [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  permanent. I want to have more money in the hand. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=304.36s)]
*  The American people. But we have to do math up here. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  And my Republican colleagues need to step to the plate, deliver on the spending restraint, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=309.32s)]
*  create savings, drop down the amount of debt that we're growing. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=314.88s)]
*  So our bond markets stabilize. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=318.0s)]
*  Interest rates can go down. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  Americans can inform houses and afford houses and we can actually do our job to get [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=321.2s)]
*  deficits under control. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=325.92s)]
*  That's what we're trying to put forward. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=327.16s)]
*  And so let's look ahead for a second. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=329.44s)]
*  And Congressman Roy, March 15th, you got the debt limit showdown, you got the budget and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=330.8s)]
*  the government funding expiring. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=335.24s)]
*  We know that House conservatives for a long time now always want concessions on spending. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=337.52s)]
*  But what's actually possible here? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=343.0s)]
*  President Trump's driving the discussion more than anyone. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=344.44s)]
*  What can you exact out of him? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=347.68s)]
*  Well, our job is to work with the president to achieve his objective and our objective, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=352.6s)]
*  which is to reduce deficits and create economic growth. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=356.48s)]
*  And so what we're doing is just saying in the budget committee and here in the House [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=359.56s)]
*  that we need to deliver on the spending cuts we all promised. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=363.48s)]
*  We're not asking for anything more than that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=366.6s)]
*  If we do that, if we simply deliver on the two hundred and fifty billion dollars in cuts, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=368.52s)]
*  that would unlock having permanent 10 year plus tax relief, unlock economic growth and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=372.72s)]
*  deliver. And by the way, we can do this part by providing some funding for defense and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=377.92s)]
*  border. And then in March, we can hold appropriations flat. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=382.2s)]
*  We can just say, look, we're going to do a continuing resolution through the end of the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=385.92s)]
*  year, pass spending flat for the next year. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=388.72s)]
*  Hold that in check, save another two hundred billion dollars, and then we're actually [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=391.48s)]
*  really cooking with peanut oil. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=395.0s)]
*  And that's what I think the American people sent us here to do. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=396.48s)]
*  So we'll be working with the president to do that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=398.96s)]
*  And finally, immigration. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=402.0s)]
*  Texas Governor Greg Abbott met with the president at the White House today to discuss the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=403.84s)]
*  border, including his 11 billion dollar reimbursement request for border security. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=407.96s)]
*  Let's listen. This is in a way a realistic transaction because Texas can transfer to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=412.24s)]
*  the United States of America value of well over five or six billion dollars of real [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=419.4s)]
*  assets on the ground that Texas put in place that will continue to secure the United [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=425.08s)]
*  States for decades to come. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=429.67999999999995s)]
*  Governor Abbott said he will be back in Washington next week to discuss this with lawmakers. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=433.0s)]
*  Where do you stand, Congressman, on this issue? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=437.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, first of all, the governor's done a great job in trying to fill the void [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=442.12s)]
*  left by President Biden when they left our borders exposed to cartels and lawlessness [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=445.44s)]
*  and danger in Texans who've died from fentanyl poisoning and had dangerous gangs from [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=449.24s)]
*  Venezuela and elsewhere on our streets, resulting in the deaths of our people. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=453.16s)]
*  Governor Abbott deserves credit for that. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=456.92s)]
*  DPS agents that stood in the breach. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=458.36s)]
*  And now they want to get paid back. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=460.6s)]
*  The governor is correct. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=462.16s)]
*  We Texans want to be paid back. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=463.08s)]
*  I'm leading a letter among my Texas delegation. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=464.64s)]
*  I think we'll get all of us on it, along with my friends in the Senate, Senators [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=466.64s)]
*  Cornyn and Cruz, for the eleven point one billion dollars over and above our normal [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  expenditures that Texas has spent to do the job the federal government refused to do. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=474.40000000000003s)]
*  So working with Governor Abbott, proud to do it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=478.6s)]
*  We need to be paid back. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=481.24s)]
*  There are some of those assets that I think we could hand over to the administration. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=482.48s)]
*  But eleven billion dollars. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=487.04s)]
*  Think about that. That's a lot of money, even in Texas, where the eight biggest economy [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=488.56s)]
*  in the world. That's eleven billion dollars, not in our schools, eleven billion dollars, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=491.64s)]
*  not on our highways protecting our people. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=495.24s)]
*  Eleven billion dollars that's not out there in property tax relief for Texans. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=497.32s)]
*  Why? Because the federal government failed to do their job. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=501.2s)]
*  So Governor Abbott's right. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=503.56s)]
*  We need to deliver for Texans. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=504.72s)]
*  Congressman Chip Roy, thank you. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=506.91999999999996s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aU83d5Y-Bg&t=509.08s)]
