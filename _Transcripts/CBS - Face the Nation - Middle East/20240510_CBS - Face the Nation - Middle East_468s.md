# Netanyahu says he's moving forward with Rafah offensive despite Biden's warning
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to move forward with the full-scale [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=0.0s)]
*  invasion of Rafa with or without the support of the United States. Netanyahu declared that his [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=4.64s)]
*  military would stand alone after President Biden threatened to suspend arms shipments to Israel. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=10.32s)]
*  The hardline stance is a result of growing concerns for how the bombs could be used [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=16.8s)]
*  in Gaza's most densely populated city. Earlier on the stream, we spoke with the director of UNRWA, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=21.92s)]
*  Gaza, Scott Anderson, who is in Rafa. Anne Marie Green asked him what he wants people to know [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=27.92s)]
*  about the situation there. Innocent people are suffering. Most people are very much the same [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  all over the world. They just want a better life for themselves, for their children, and to have [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=40.88s)]
*  a future. And what you see now is people that do not have a future. It'll take decades to rebuild [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Gaza, to give people an opportunity to try to have a better life for themselves, for their families, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=51.52s)]
*  and that this war is having a real impact on people, on their ability to survive, on their [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=57.68s)]
*  ability to take care of their families, and on their ability to take care of their children. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=63.76s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Innocencio is following these developments from Tel Aviv. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=67.84s)]
*  Remy, Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will go in alone if it needs to. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=73.12s)]
*  Can it sustain the war effort without U.S. support? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Elaine, good to see you. That is what the Israel Defense Force is saying. The spokesman for [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=80.08s)]
*  the military, Daniel Hagari, said we have what we need, that's a quote, in terms of ammunition for [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=87.92s)]
*  the Rafa operation as well as for future planned operations. And today we did hear more defiance [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=93.52s)]
*  from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that came in an interview with Dr. Phil, the TV talk show [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=99.52s)]
*  host, who did a sit down with him here in Jerusalem. He said, again, if we have to stand alone, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=105.36s)]
*  we'll stand alone. And the pause that President Biden put on that weapon shipment amounts to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=110.16s)]
*  what appears to be a drop in the bucket really in what the U.S. gives Israel. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=116.0s)]
*  There is an existing standing 10-year agreement from the Obama era that allows the U.S. to send [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=119.28s)]
*  more than $3 billion of arms to Israel. And if the dollar amount falls below a certain figure, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=124.88s)]
*  they actually don't even have to be legally disclosed. On top of that, we know that Israel [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=130.4s)]
*  has an undisclosed amount of weapons stockpiles also from the U.S. So to your question, we might [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=134.56s)]
*  actually never really know the truth. Well, Israel continues to carry out strikes in Rafa days after [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=139.04s)]
*  seizing control of the Gaza side of the Rafa crossing. What is happening on the ground there? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=143.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, in advance appears to be happening, Elaine. Reuters reported earlier that Israeli [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=148.24s)]
*  tanks completely encircled the eastern half of the city and they've taken the main road that divides [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  the city into two. And we got that news this morning and then checked in with our own CBS News [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=162.72s)]
*  team in Gaza. They told us at that same time that there was a pause that had started in the fighting [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=166.56s)]
*  and that had been going on for at least an hour. Since that, though, it's picked up. The fighting [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=172.0s)]
*  has picked up with reports of gunfire and Hamas reportedly ambushing tanks near a mosque, again, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=176.24s)]
*  in the eastern part of the city. So if all this is true, that means the IDF has advanced closer [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=182.88s)]
*  to the built-up part of Rafa. And then just a few hours ago, Elaine, local Israeli media reported [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  that the war cabinet here approved the IDF to go deeper into Rafa, and that was a unanimous decision. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=193.44s)]
*  Well, Remy, before we let you go, I'm wondering what people in Israel think about Rafa and what [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=198.56s)]
*  kind of public sentiment there may be on either side. Sure. Well, in terms of what people feel [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  here, it depends on what kind of media they will be watching. And a criticism that has been used [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=212.56s)]
*  here is that people see what they want to see, but that's something similar to what happens in any [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=220.56s)]
*  country, right? In the United States, people decide to go and follow the media that they want to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=225.68s)]
*  believe. And so a lot of people actually will be watching, listening to Israeli media. A lot of that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=230.24s)]
*  is focused on the domestic issue. The criticism is that they're not actually seeing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=237.6s)]
*  what's happening as much on the ground in Gaza as what we are talking about, as what other [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=241.28s)]
*  international organizations are talking about. So here on the ground, if you want to hear [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=246.4s)]
*  what's happening in Gaza, what's happening in the world and opinions about Israel, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=252.56s)]
*  you will be able to hear it. A lot of people here are focused very much on the domestic issue, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=256.48s)]
*  and that is getting the hostages home and also the political situation with Israeli Prime Minister [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=260.32s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. All right. Remy, in a sense, you're with the very latest. Remy, thank you so much. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=264.88s)]
*  The UN General Assembly has overwhelmingly voted in favor of a resolution to give new [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=271.28s)]
*  rights and privileges to Palestine. It calls on the Security Council to reconsider Palestine's [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=276.88s)]
*  request to join the United Nations. The U.S., Israel, and seven other countries voted against [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  the resolution. Meanwhile, the State Department is expected to submit a report to Congress, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  which investigated if countries that get aid from the U.S. use it in accordance with U.S. law. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=292.4s)]
*  Israel's conduct in Gaza is a part of that report, and lawmakers could get their hands on it as soon [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  as today. Let's bring in CBS News Senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe for [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=305.76s)]
*  more on this. So, Ed, what is the latest from the White House and how it's monitoring the situation [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=310.55999999999995s)]
*  in the Middle East? Well, it continues to do so, and Remy, of course, has laid out the latest from [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=315.28s)]
*  that region. But what we are most keen for right now is the release of this long-anticipated State [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  Department report that will essentially certify or clarify whether, in the view of the State [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=327.84s)]
*  Department and the Biden administration, Israel is violating U.S. law by using weapons that the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  United States provides in ways it's not supposed to. This is essentially a report that was ordered [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=340.08s)]
*  up under congressional pressure by the president amid concerns among especially Senate Democrats [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=345.12s)]
*  that Israel was using weaponry and other military equipment to continue this offensive and lead to [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=352.0s)]
*  the deaths of thousands. Remember, you've seen President Biden this week in an interview concede [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=358.4s)]
*  that weapons provided by the United States have been used to kill civilians in Gaza, which is to [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=363.04s)]
*  many people around the world apparent, but it was the first time he so explicitly conceded that point, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=368.64s)]
*  and it's part of the reason why at least one shipment of thousands of thousand-pound bombs [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=374.08s)]
*  has been delayed to Israel out of concern that they may be used in a forthcoming assault on [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=379.6s)]
*  Rafa. So we'll see if that report comes later today, what it says, and how Washington officially [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  reacts to it. And amid that, of course, the administration continues monitoring the talks [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=390.16s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas and whether it is, in fact, that the Israeli military is preparing for [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=395.20000000000005s)]
*  an offensive. Meantime, the president is in San Francisco today and Seattle later tonight. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  Tell us what he's doing out there. That's right, a reminder that he is campaigning for [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=405.68s)]
*  his job or to keep it for four more years. He's not holding public campaign events, but raising [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=410.56s)]
*  a significant amount of money, it's believed, probably several million dollars at stops in the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=415.28s)]
*  Bay Area and then Seattle. Part of the ongoing push to raise as much money as possible in the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=420.24s)]
*  cash race with the Trump campaign and put it away now ahead of a busy travel schedule come the summer. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=425.52s)]
*  The president making those stops at the end of a week in which he's been mostly focused, as we've [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=432.48s)]
*  pointed out, on foreign policy issues. But it's expected that we will hear soon exactly how much [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  he raised in the month of April. Remember, the number at the top is roughly 72 million that the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=442.56s)]
*  Republicans say they raised for the Trump campaign and for the Republican National Committee. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=447.68s)]
*  The Democrats say we'll hear about it in the coming days ahead of the official deadline. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=452.56s)]
*  But this is mostly a private and fundraising trip out west to collect as much coin as possible from [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=456.64s)]
*  wealthy donors out there. All right, Ed O'Keefe at the White House for us, Ed, thank you. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsBPgMpQQ&t=463.2s)]
