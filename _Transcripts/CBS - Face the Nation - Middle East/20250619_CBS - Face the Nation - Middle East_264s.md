# Iran's retaliation options if U.S. strikes
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo)
*  As we've been reporting, President Trump says he will make a decision on whether to strike Iran within the next two weeks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=0.0s)]
*  Both President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have said they do not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  but Iran's supreme leader has warned U.S. intervention would cause, quote, irreparable damage. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=14.44s)]
*  Robert Pape joins us now. He's a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=20.52s)]
*  as well as the author of the book, Bombing to Win, Air Power and Coercion in War. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=25.36s)]
*  So the right person to talk to about all this. Thank you very much for joining us. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=30.96s)]
*  Where in Iran is the U.S. most likely to strike should it choose to intervene? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=35.12s)]
*  Absolutely. This would be Fordow. That's where the 60 percent in Richmond is incurring and likely also Natanz. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=41.56s)]
*  But I want to emphasize that it is probably too late for air power alone to do the job. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=49.64s)]
*  And you're seeing that Israel already knows it can't do the job alone. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=56.68s)]
*  But even with America, there's a big problem. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=60.6s)]
*  And the big problem is the size of the nuclear stockpile of enriched material that Iran has. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=63.96s)]
*  Even if America can destroy 90 percent of that enriched material, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=71.44000000000001s)]
*  that would still leave enough for at least one nuclear bomb. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=77.2s)]
*  And the idea that any air power, any air strike can guarantee 100 percent? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=82.88000000000001s)]
*  I don't think so. And I think Donald Trump knows that's not true either. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=88.76s)]
*  And that's what's going on here. And what's going on is he's looking at other options. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  We can you send commandos in. These people could be killed on the spot and probably extremely risky missions. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=97.56s)]
*  So this is what's going on. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=104.48s)]
*  Why the two weeks is not just about Iran getting into the negotiating table. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=106.4s)]
*  It's is there any way to use military force to knock this thing out? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=111.68s)]
*  Again, even 90 percent isn't going to do it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=116.68s)]
*  And this is a big problem because you then have a nuclear Iran is now an extremely angry rat with nuclear teeth. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=120.64s)]
*  That is one very strong metaphor to put it there, Robert. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=128.68s)]
*  If the U.S. does go after, though, Iran's nuclear sites, what options does Iran have to retaliate? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=132.64s)]
*  What could it potentially do? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=137.88s)]
*  It has a lot of retaliation. They're already signaling they will attack American bases. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=140.64s)]
*  The number one thing, however, they're probably going to do is covertly sprint to that nuclear weapon. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  That is, the attack will cause nuclear breakout and we're not going to be able to see it coming. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  And that is the real danger zone we're moving into. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=159.96s)]
*  You see, people are focusing on the things they can see and maybe then counteract. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  What the problem is, is what we can't see and what we won't see, because Iran's not going to tell us, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=168.96s)]
*  is exactly how they're fashioning that remaining nuclear material and whether or not they have some other nuclear sites we don't even know about, say, up in the mountains of Iran. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=176.0s)]
*  Iran is four times bigger than Iraq. They've got huge mountain ranges. They've got a lot of places they could have stored things, already be doing some work that we may not even know. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=187.0s)]
*  This is really, we're moving into a true danger zone where we're not going to be able to know what Iran, what's coming at us. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=198.16s)]
*  Of course, this isn't happening in a vacuum. There are so many players involved here. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=206.16s)]
*  How much control would Iran have over potential reaction from proxy groups like the Houthis in Yemen? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=210.16s)]
*  The problem here is people will be inspired, their proxies will be inspired on their own. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=217.16s)]
*  I've already seen that with the Israeli strikes, they are degrading Iran's command and control. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=222.32s)]
*  They're deliberately weakening the ability of Iran not just to give these proxies the green light, but to call them off. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=229.32s)]
*  Now we're in a situation where you have very loose relationships between Iran and the proxies, and these proxies are very radical. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=237.32s)]
*  Iran, it's not just Iran is pushing the proxies, Iran also controls and restrains the proxies. Well, that restraint is being lifted fast. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=247.48s)]
*  We appreciate all of your insight. Robert Pape, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=257.48s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWYGHqgnuo&t=262.48s)]
