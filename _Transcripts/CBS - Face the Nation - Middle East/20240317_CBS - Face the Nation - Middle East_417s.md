# Claims that UNRWA is Hamas "proxy" are "just flat-out lies," Sen. Chris Van Hollen says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [March 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0)
*  We're joined now by Maryland Democrat Senator Chris Van Hollen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, a lot to get to with you, but I do know you met with some families of hostage [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=3.52s)]
*  members this past week. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=8.34s)]
*  Talks are about to resume. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=14.02s)]
*  What did the hostage families tell you? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  Well, they came and talked about the terror every day of not knowing what's happening [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=17.78s)]
*  to their family members. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=24.44s)]
*  And they were very clear. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=26.18s)]
*  We need to focus on getting the hostages back and a ceasefire. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=28.0s)]
*  And this is why I'm for a ceasefire and the return of the hostages. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=31.68s)]
*  And that ceasefire would also allow for aid to move in. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=36.32s)]
*  That's what the Biden administration is championing. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=39.16s)]
*  I want to go to some specific things that I know you're focusing on. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=42.2s)]
*  There's this government funding debate happening in the next few days. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=46.28s)]
*  Some Republicans want to cut off support for the UN agency UNRWA that supports about 6 [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=49.44s)]
*  million Palestinian refugees, Lebanon, Jordan, Gaza Strip, West Bank. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=55.4s)]
*  You said last week senators need to read the classified report prepared by the director [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=59.72s)]
*  of national intelligence about the Netanyahu government claims about that agency. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=64.47999999999999s)]
*  You seem to be implying that the links to terror groups are unfounded. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=69.96s)]
*  Oh, there's no doubt that the claim that Prime Minister Netanyahu and others are making that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=74.52s)]
*  somehow UNRWA is a proxy for Hamas are just flat out lies. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=80.86s)]
*  That's a flat out lie. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=85.94s)]
*  If you look at the person who's in charge of operations on the ground in Gaza for UNRWA, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=87.66s)]
*  it's about a 20 year US Army veteran. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=93.26s)]
*  You can be sure he is not in cahoots with Hamas. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=96.62s)]
*  Netanyahu has wanted to get rid of UNRWA since at least 2017. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=100.98s)]
*  That's been his goal, not just in Gaza, but also in the other places you talked about. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=107.04s)]
*  If you get rid of UNRWA in Gaza today, it is the primary distribution system for food [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=113.2s)]
*  and aid. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=119.28s)]
*  If you cut off funding for UNRWA in Gaza entirely, it means more people will starve, more people [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  won't get the medical assistance they need. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  It would be a huge mistake to cut them off. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  Can you explain why you believe that the Prime Minister is trying to dismantle UNRWA, which [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=133.88s)]
*  is the agency that has 13,000 people distributing aid. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=139.64s)]
*  No one else has that kind of infrastructure in Gaza. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=143.0s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=145.32s)]
*  There have been allegations made by the Netanyahu government that up to 14 of those 13,000 people [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=147.26s)]
*  were involved in the horrific October 7 attacks. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=154.2s)]
*  We should investigate it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=158.12s)]
*  We should hold all those people accountable. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=159.12s)]
*  But for goodness sakes, let's not hold two million innocent Palestinian civilians who [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=161.6s)]
*  are dying of starvation. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=168.76s)]
*  Let's not hold them essentially accountable for the bad acts of 14 people. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  Netanyahu's wanted to get rid of UNRWA because he is seeing them as a means to continue the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=179.56s)]
*  hopes of the Palestinian people for a homeland of their own. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=187.88s)]
*  He has been opposed to a two-state solution. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=191.08s)]
*  This has been his primary objective, stopping a two-state solution. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=195.84s)]
*  Back in February, you pushed the Biden administration to craft what ended up being a national security [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  memorandum that requires countries who receive US weapons, all countries, to certify that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=205.56s)]
*  they are in compliance with US law and they are not blocking the delivery of humanitarian [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=211.24s)]
*  aid. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=215.16s)]
*  Israel has until March 24th to turn in a letter. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=216.16s)]
*  They reportedly did so. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=218.68s)]
*  Are they in compliance? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=220.62s)]
*  No, they're not. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=221.62s)]
*  Not as of today. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=223.58s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=224.58s)]
*  This is a very important tool that the Biden administration's put forward. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=225.58s)]
*  It applies to Israel and any other country that receives US military assistance. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=229.78s)]
*  Will President Biden's administration say that they're not in compliance? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=233.3s)]
*  Are you confident? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=237.58s)]
*  I hope they will because President Biden himself has repeatedly said that the Netanyahu government [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=238.58s)]
*  is unnecessarily restricting desperately needed humanitarian assistance. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=246.92s)]
*  The President has said it a number of times. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=251.23999999999998s)]
*  He said no excuses. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=253.11999999999998s)]
*  It may be that the Minister of Defense in Israel signed this, but I cannot imagine a [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=256.03999999999996s)]
*  scenario right now where Secretary Blinken can find that that promise is credible and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=261.84s)]
*  reliable when the day it was signed, clearly the Netanyahu government is not in compliance [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=268.52s)]
*  because we see that they're continuing to restrict humanitarian assistance. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=273.6s)]
*  We'll watch to see if Secretary Blinken affirms it or denies it, but what's the consequence [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  here? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=282.64s)]
*  I know you've said you don't want to cut off all military support for Israel. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=283.64s)]
*  You're talking about offensive weapons. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=286.44s)]
*  Yes, this would not apply to the Iron Dome or any defensive systems, but it would say [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=288.88s)]
*  no more bombs for use in Gaza until you come into compliance. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  So it's not a total cutoff. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=299.8s)]
*  The Netanyahu government can open their Reds Crossing to help starving people in northern [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=301.6s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  They can stop turning away maternity kits, you know, claiming that somehow they pose [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  a dual use danger that they could be used for military purposes. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=312.52000000000004s)]
*  They could stop turning away water purifiers because when they do that, they send the whole [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=316.16s)]
*  truck back for four weeks. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=321.40000000000003s)]
*  So they need to allow more assistance in and they need to really deal with that de-confliction [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=322.72s)]
*  issue. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  People need to be able to deliver assistance without getting killed. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, and the U.S. Ambassador David Satterfield, who works for the Biden administration, has [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=331.36s)]
*  said that police have been hit while helping UN convoys be delivered. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=336.32000000000005s)]
*  Do you believe that the Israeli government is deliberately targeting to stop humanitarian [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=343.16s)]
*  aid deliveries because the Israeli government denies that? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=346.76000000000005s)]
*  Well, we know in the case of, I think, about six of these sort of called blue-helmeted [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=349.64000000000004s)]
*  security escorts that they were targeted because Israel claimed that they were part of Hamas [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=354.48s)]
*  and they were sort of...so we know in that case that was a deliberate targeting. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=360.72s)]
*  But you're right, there have been other cases where Israel has, you know, used force and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=367.72s)]
*  a convoy, for example, in the north passed the inspection and then was hit by a naval [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=374.48s)]
*  missile. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=379.56s)]
*  I do want to point out also, Margaret, that Ambassador Satterfield has said very clearly [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=380.56s)]
*  that when it comes to UN provided humanitarian assistance, like humanitarian assistance through [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=386.36s)]
*  UNRWA, there's been no evidence of diversion to Hamas. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=392.0s)]
*  He said this very, very clearly. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=396.72s)]
*  And all of Congress has received that information? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  I have tried to tell my colleagues who keep coming back from meeting with Netanyahu government [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=401.32s)]
*  officials spreading this lie, this myth about diversion from UNRWA. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=405.88s)]
*  Now there may be diversion to other places, but not from UNRWA. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  Senator, we'll watch what happens in the coming days. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3RBuGaOd0&t=414.28s)]
