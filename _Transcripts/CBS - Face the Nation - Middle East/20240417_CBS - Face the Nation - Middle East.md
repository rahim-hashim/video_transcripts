# U.N. says level of destruction in Gaza is hindering aid distribution
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc)
*  Iran's president warns that any response from Israel to Saturday's attack will be dealt [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=0.0s)]
*  with fiercely and severely. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=4.72s)]
*  Israel's war cabinet is considering its retaliation options today. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=10.36s)]
*  Iran launched hundreds of missiles and drones towards Israel Saturday in response to a strike [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  on its consulate in Syria earlier this month. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=18.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel is facing intense scrutiny over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=21.92s)]
*  Israeli military officials say they're opening up new ways for aid to get in after being [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=27.28s)]
*  accused of intentionally limiting access to civilians in need. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=32.0s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Debra Pata is following the latest from Israel. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=36.0s)]
*  Debra, good morning. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=39.88s)]
*  The United Nations says Israel has shown signs of good intentions regarding aid, but that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=41.92s)]
*  over 40 percent of its requests to transport supplies through Israeli checkpoints in Gaza [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=46.84s)]
*  were turned down last week. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  Under pressure from the U.S. to flood Gaza with humanitarian aid, Israel insists it is [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=55.64s)]
*  doing everything it can. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=61.44s)]
*  Just this morning, saying the UN needs to do its job and collect enough supplies to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=63.8s)]
*  fill 700 trucks waiting at the Kiryam Shalom crossing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  But the UN says it's not just about food, but distribution, which is hindered by the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=74.32s)]
*  almost total destruction of civilian infrastructure in Gaza. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=80.12s)]
*  Roads have been blown up along with health, water and sanitation facilities. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=85.2s)]
*  The problem is not just about food. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=91.0s)]
*  The problem is that a family is much more complex. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=94.12s)]
*  It's much bigger than simply bringing in flour and bake a few loaves of bread or pita. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=98.16s)]
*  In the north, one bakery was brought to life for the first time in six months after receiving [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=105.48s)]
*  fuel and flour. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  For many, it is a lifeline. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=113.04s)]
*  It had reached the point, as Samdaoud said, where we were eating animal feed. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=115.4s)]
*  But it is not enough. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  Many waited more than six hours for just one loaf of bread. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  Humanitarian workers do what they can. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=130.6s)]
*  The demand to fill bowl after bowl never ending. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=133.4s)]
*  One third of children under the age of two are acutely malnourished, says UNICEF, prior [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=137.32s)]
*  to October 7, there were none. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=142.88s)]
*  Israel's war cabinet meets again today, but its attention is not on Gaza but the crisis [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=151.28s)]
*  A senior American official tells CBS News Israel has not shared its plans with the US, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=152.28s)]
*  but some in the administration expect a limited strike inside Iran. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=158.32s)]
*  Vlad, Annemarie? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=163.12s)]
*  All right, Deborah, thank you. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=165.12s)]
*  For more on the conflict in the Middle East, let's bring in CBS News foreign correspondent [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=167.64s)]
*  MTS Tayyab. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=171.64s)]
*  MTS, you're in Tel Aviv. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=172.64s)]
*  So let's start with British Foreign Secretary David Cameron. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=174.56s)]
*  He's in Jerusalem today. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=177.56s)]
*  I want to play a little bit of what he had to say. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=178.56s)]
*  It's clear the Israelis are making a decision to act. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  We hope they do so in a way that does as little to escalate this as possible. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=185.67999999999998s)]
*  We want to see coordinated sanctions against Iran. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  Britain has in many ways led the way with our new sanctions regime, sanctioning dozens [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  of people in Iran, sanctioning the IRGC in its entirety. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=198.26s)]
*  And I think there's more that we can do to show a united front. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=203.17999999999998s)]
*  So I feel like previous comments from David Cameron, he was very, very supportive of Israel. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=207.42s)]
*  Now he's starting to kind of massage that a little in terms of, you know, Israel's response. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=211.98s)]
*  What more can you tell us about his comments and how Western allies are responding? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=218.18s)]
*  Yeah, and Maria, it's really interesting to see in real time the modulating and modifying [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=223.54s)]
*  of language as these days progress since that extraordinary attack by Iran in which over [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=229.85999999999999s)]
*  300 drones, crews and ballistic missiles were targeted at Israel, which we must also acknowledge [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=236.34s)]
*  was Iran's retaliation to Israel bombing its diplomatic compound inside the Syrian capital [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=242.5s)]
*  Damascus, in which a number of senior Revolutionary Guard commanders were killed. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=249.46s)]
*  That in itself was unprecedented. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=254.34s)]
*  So now we have these two very unprecedented things happening. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=256.18s)]
*  And the fear that Lord Cameron has and indeed President Biden and others have is that this [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=259.38s)]
*  tit for tat will spiral into something more serious. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=264.26s)]
*  And saying that Israel making it very clear that it is going to respond. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=268.18s)]
*  It hasn't said how, clearly not telling its allies how it's going to do it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=272.42s)]
*  But it does seem as if that whatever Israel does do that, they have the intent, rather, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=277.02s)]
*  that it's going to be limited in scope and that the hope is that it's not going to spread [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=282.53999999999996s)]
*  any further. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=288.09999999999997s)]
*  But that is not least because so many of Israel's allies, and that includes Britain and the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=289.18s)]
*  U.S., are really encouraging them to really draw things down. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=294.9s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=298.9s)]
*  Iran's president is already warning that any action against the country will be met with [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=300.26s)]
*  a severe response. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=305.41999999999996s)]
*  Can you speak to the seriousness behind this threat? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=306.9s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  All of this telegraphing, if you will, and it's all very coordinated. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  But I think it's very clear that the Iranian leadership wants de-escalation, does not want [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=317.5s)]
*  this to turn into an all-out war between Israel and Iran. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=323.65999999999997s)]
*  It would be catastrophic for the region, catastrophic for Israel, but also catastrophic for Iran. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=329.38s)]
*  This is a country of 90 million people, which already suffers from extraordinary unrest. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=335.98s)]
*  And, Marie, we've been following the protests that we saw in Iran over the past year or [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=341.26s)]
*  so following the killing of Massa Amini. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=345.98s)]
*  And so Iran is really grappling with a lot of domestic problems, as well as what's happening [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=348.70000000000005s)]
*  now with Israel. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=354.02000000000004s)]
*  But again, it has to talk tough, and it felt like it needed to respond to the bombing of [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=355.62s)]
*  its embassy, the leveling up and the killing of those very senior members of the Revolutionary [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=362.02s)]
*  Guard. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=366.74s)]
*  And very quickly, what's interesting about that are sources on the ground in Iran telling [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=367.74s)]
*  us that there is this really grassroots movement in Iran calling on the leaders to do something. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=371.58s)]
*  And we saw that something this weekend. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=378.02s)]
*  Marie. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=380.41999999999996s)]
*  We certainly did. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=381.41999999999996s)]
*  MTS, thank you. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgA3m35mEc&t=382.41999999999996s)]
