# H.R. McMaster on Trump's handling of Middle East conflict, Army anniversary parade and more
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE)
*  Welcome back to The Takeout, continuing our conversation with H.R. McMaster, who for a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=0.0s)]
*  time was national security advisor to President Trump in the first term. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=4.64s)]
*  How do you think he's evaluating all this, H.R. the president? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=9.18s)]
*  One of the many, one of the many major national security advisors. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  The running list is now six. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=18.44s)]
*  So I think what he's doing is trying to resolve, I think, the two opposing ideas that President [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=23.52s)]
*  Trump holds in his head about the Middle East and about Iran in particular. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=29.38s)]
*  Of course, President Trump is very big on peace for strength. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=33.1s)]
*  And he also recognized that Iran is the problem in the region. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=35.92s)]
*  Iran has been perpetuating these proxy wars in the region, applying the Hezbollah model [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=39.14s)]
*  to the region in which they create these militias and terrorist organizations that lay outside [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=44.22s)]
*  of government's control that can be turned against that government if that government [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=49.22s)]
*  acts against Iranian interests. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=53.08s)]
*  This is what they did in Lebanon with this Hezbollah model. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=54.86s)]
*  It's what they kind of did with Assad and propping him up with the Houthis in Yemen [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=57.7s)]
*  and of course with this Hashdashabi militias, group of militias in Iraq as well. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  And their strategy has been to kind of expend every Arab life in their effort to kick the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=68.66s)]
*  United States out of the region as the first step in destroying Israel and killing all [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=73.42s)]
*  the Jews. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=78.42s)]
*  That's really what they wanted to do. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=79.42s)]
*  President Trump understands all that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=80.68s)]
*  He also understands, as you've heard him say many times in the past, that Iran can't have [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=82.28s)]
*  a nuclear weapon, which is very consistent with the Beg and Doctrine. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=87.26s)]
*  The Beg and Doctrine is of course Israel's determination to ensure that a hostile or [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=90.7s)]
*  an enemy state doesn't have the most destructive weapons on earth. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=94.62s)]
*  They acted on that doctrine the first time in 1981 with strikes against a nuclear reactor [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=97.66000000000001s)]
*  in Iraq and again in 2007 with strikes against a nuclear reactor in Syria. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=104.5s)]
*  Of course, what they've done in Iran is orders and orders of magnitude far beyond those strikes [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=109.42s)]
*  and much more difficult in terms of complexity. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=116.66000000000001s)]
*  So President Trump understands all that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=119.06s)]
*  But what he also has is a deep skepticism about getting more deeply involved in the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=121.38000000000001s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=126.10000000000001s)]
*  Many of his strongest supporters have used kind of this mantra of ending endless wars [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  and will say to him, you know, hey, don't let Israel drag us into a war in the Middle [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=131.86s)]
*  East. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=138.22s)]
*  So how he reconciles, I think, those two conflicting views within his own mind and within his administration, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=139.22s)]
*  I think will help determine the outcome. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=145.86s)]
*  I think the principal determinant, though, will be as you and Sam were talking about, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=147.9s)]
*  which is does Iran decide to strike out against U.S. personnel, U.S. facilities as well as [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=153.38000000000002s)]
*  Israeli facilities? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=161.66000000000003s)]
*  Because that makes it kind of an easy decision for President Trump that he would have to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=163.26000000000002s)]
*  respond to that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=167.98000000000002s)]
*  H.R., the Army turns 250 this weekend. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=169.22000000000003s)]
*  There's a big parade in Washington. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=171.94000000000003s)]
*  Do you have any problem with that? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=173.14000000000001s)]
*  I have no problem with that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=176.66000000000003s)]
*  But what I don't want is I don't want it to be politicized from a partisan perspective. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=178.62s)]
*  What we are celebrating is that day in the Second Continental Congress on June 14, 1775, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=186.70000000000002s)]
*  when John Adams, the delegate from Massachusetts, convinced his colleagues, hey, we need a Continental [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=197.06s)]
*  Army. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=203.9s)]
*  So they decided to raise 10 companies of riflemen to go assist the militias that were besieging [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=204.94s)]
*  Boston at the time, British-held Boston. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=215.38s)]
*  And the next thing they decided, the next day on the 15th, was to appoint George Washington [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=218.18s)]
*  as the first commander in chief of that force. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=224.22s)]
*  And what we need to do is approach this parade as George Washington approached his duties [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=226.58s)]
*  as patriots who celebrate our Army, which has fought in a nonpartisan way to win our [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=232.7s)]
*  freedom in the War of Independence and then to preserve our freedom since then. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  But H.R., you know there is a heavy President Trump overlay on all this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=244.85999999999999s)]
*  And there are those who say this is going to look like an authoritarian celebration. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=249.73999999999998s)]
*  It's not an authoritarian celebration. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=255.62s)]
*  I know that the president, I'll tell you, like many other politicians lately has been [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=257.62s)]
*  trying to drag kind of the military into partisan dialogue. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=262.42s)]
*  I mean, some of the things he says and does, like the speech at Fort Bragg, for example, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=265.38s)]
*  I just want to say, God, it was a great speech until that moment when, you know, when you [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=270.38s)]
*  make it a partisan issue or in front of troops, you know, disparage their previous commander [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=275.22s)]
*  in chief. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=281.06s)]
*  So I think what Americans can do is just stress to all, to all of our politicians, don't [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=282.06s)]
*  drag the military into partisan politics. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=288.98s)]
*  I would say the Biden administration was pushing a radical social agenda on the military. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=291.3s)]
*  President Trump and Secretary Hexseth are applying a corrective to that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=297.22s)]
*  But hey, let's make sure that the cure is not worse than the disease. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=301.34000000000003s)]
*  So keep that bold line in place because, you know, wouldn't it be terrible if our military [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=304.9s)]
*  was infected, you know, with the same kind of vitriol and division that we see in other [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=310.68s)]
*  institutions? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=315.96s)]
*  We can't afford it because you know what, those kind of divisions are inimical to combat [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=316.96s)]
*  effectiveness. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=322.48s)]
*  You know, in our army, we judge the soldier next to us based on their toughness, their [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=323.48s)]
*  courage, their sense of honor, their discipline. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=328.64s)]
*  I don't care what their political affiliation is. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=332.32s)]
*  I don't care what their identity category is. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=335.12s)]
*  And that's what we have to make sure we preserve. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  H.R., there are National Guard in Los Angeles against the wishes of the mayor and the governor [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  and the United States Marines. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=345.6s)]
*  Excessive or appropriate? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=347.44s)]
*  I think appropriate in this case, Major. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=350.68s)]
*  I would say maybe not the Marines who aren't trained for this. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=353.0s)]
*  But when you had the incidents that, you know, that we've all read about, which is, you know, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=356.64s)]
*  the threats to federal officers, the threats to federal sites, I mean, that is well within [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=360.88s)]
*  the president's purview to protect those personnel and to protect those sites. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=365.72s)]
*  I think what's regrettable about the situation is, you know, California is a sanctuary state, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=371.24s)]
*  you know, Los Angeles is a sanctuary city. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=376.44000000000005s)]
*  And, you know, what we're talking about is really enforcing the law. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=379.36s)]
*  And it's regrettable that this, you know, this federalization of the National Guard [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=383.0s)]
*  had to happen. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=388.92s)]
*  But I think in this case, it's appropriate. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=390.04s)]
*  I would say unless the Marine Corps are absolutely needed, they're not really [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=391.96000000000004s)]
*  trained for this mission set for the National Guard. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=395.68s)]
*  I think it's completely appropriate. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=399.0s)]
*  There's a lot of disinformation out there, Major. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=400.12s)]
*  I mean, you're not going to have National Guard make an arrest. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=402.32s)]
*  I mean, they may have to temporarily detain somebody who's a threat. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=404.76s)]
*  But there has been no activation of Posse Comitatus or any kind of martial law. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=407.68s)]
*  This should be, it should be the National Guard working hand in hand. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=413.68s)]
*  But sadly, you know, the leadership within the state of California and in Los Angeles [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=417.8s)]
*  have made it kind of their own policy and their own law to not adhere to federal laws [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=423.6s)]
*  and enforce them. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=429.8s)]
*  H.R. McMaster, I appreciate the time, sir, very much. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=430.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=433.64s)]
*  Great. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=434.64s)]
*  Great to be with you, Major. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxOVJiwXyE&t=435.64s)]
