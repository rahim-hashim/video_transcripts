# Israel, Hamas inch toward possible cease-fire deal
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w)
*  Now to the Middle East, where daily strikes between Hezbollah and Israeli forces have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=0.0s)]
*  ignited literal fires. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=4.8s)]
*  The flames are tearing through forests and farmland on both sides of the border, causing [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=7.32s)]
*  damage to tens of thousands of acres of land that experts fear is irreversible. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=10.94s)]
*  Meanwhile, Gaza ceasefire negotiations are gaining momentum, as Israel says it will resume [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=15.84s)]
*  talks. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=21.04s)]
*  The announcement came shortly after Hamas submitted revised terms of the peace proposal. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=22.04s)]
*  CBS News' senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams is there. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=26.279999999999998s)]
*  She joins us from Tel Aviv, Israel. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=29.48s)]
*  Holly, let's start off with what could be the biggest breakthrough, the ceasefire. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  How significant is the developing negotiations? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=36.6s)]
*  What's different from previous talks? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=40.84s)]
*  Hey there, Lana. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, look, it's a good question because we've been here many times before, haven't we, seemingly [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=45.32s)]
*  on the brink of a ceasefire deal. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=49.56s)]
*  This time around, US officials are sounding remarkably upbeat. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=52.6s)]
*  In fact, one senior US official said that the Hamas response to the existing ceasefire [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=56.04s)]
*  proposal, which came on Wednesday, quote, may provide the basis for closing the deal. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=60.96s)]
*  This time around, we also know much more about that ceasefire proposal that's on the table [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=67.0s)]
*  than we have during previous negotiations because President Biden made some of it public [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=71.8s)]
*  back in May. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=76.8s)]
*  It is a three stage plan. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  Under that framework, female, elderly and wounded hostages would be released first, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=80.67999999999999s)]
*  while Israeli troops would pull out of populated areas in Gaza. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=85.64s)]
*  The second phase would see the release of the remaining living hostages and Israeli [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=89.16s)]
*  forces would withdraw from the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=93.88s)]
*  I mean, look, the bottom line is that we don't know if this will come to fruition. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=96.28s)]
*  But just a reminder, I guess, of what's at stake, because it's human beings that are [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=100.24s)]
*  at the heart of this war. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=105.36s)]
*  There are thought to be around 120 hostages still being held captive in the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=107.72s)]
*  And the death toll in Gaza is now more than 38,000, according to the Hamas-run Health [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=112.76s)]
*  Ministry. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=118.28s)]
*  Holly, so appreciate you keeping the focus on people. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=119.28s)]
*  Israeli forces are battling on multiple fronts. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=124.6s)]
*  And there are folks in each of these areas that are trying to figure out what's going [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=128.52s)]
*  on. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=134.28s)]
*  The IDF conducted an operation in the West Bank targeting Palestinian militants. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=136.2s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can tell us more about that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=140.11999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I can. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=142.83999999999997s)]
*  Palestinian authorities say that seven people were killed in an Israeli military operation [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=145.64s)]
*  in Jenin in the West Bank. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  Israel's military says that its soldiers encircled a building exchanging fire with those inside, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  which they say were terrorists, while an airstrike targeted that area. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  Now, this comes just a day after an Israeli anti-settlement group revealed new plans to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=161.64s)]
*  build more than 5,000 new homes in settlements in the West Bank. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=167.72s)]
*  Now, as you know, Palestinians want the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank to become [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  their own Palestinian state. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=177.48s)]
*  During the war in Gaza, violence has also spiked in the West Bank. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  Palestinian authorities say that more than 500 Palestinians have been killed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=184.76s)]
*  And Holly, President Biden is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=189.56s)]
*  Netanyahu later this month. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=193.08s)]
*  Both of the leaders are on the so-called political hot seat, essentially fighting for their political [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  careers right now. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=199.32000000000002s)]
*  Does that raise the stakes of this meeting? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, look, they're expected to meet in Washington later on this month. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=203.08s)]
*  I'll leave the American political analysis to my colleagues in Washington. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=207.56s)]
*  But yes, Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is fighting to stay in [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=212.24s)]
*  power and he is under immense pressure. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  He is a wartime leader. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=219.32s)]
*  There are many Israelis who blame him for the apparent security failures on October [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=220.76s)]
*  7th, as well as for not bringing all of the hostages home. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=224.68s)]
*  There may be a second war brewing between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group in [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=228.36s)]
*  Lebanon. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=234.2s)]
*  Israel is under pressure from its most important ally, the US, to end this war, while at the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=235.68s)]
*  same time far right-wing members of Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet have threatened to bring [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=240.88s)]
*  his government down if he agrees to a ceasefire. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  And then hanging over all of that are corruption allegations against Benjamin Netanyahu, which [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=250.16s)]
*  he denies. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=254.76s)]
*  So it would be the understatement of the year to say that Benjamin Netanyahu is in a bit [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=255.76s)]
*  of a tight spot, but he's been in plenty of tight spots before and there's a reason that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=260.32s)]
*  many Israelis call him the magician. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=264.56s)]
*  All right, Holly Williams there for us in Tel Aviv. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=267.0s)]
*  Thank you, Holly. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE3BVLOAS5w&t=269.64s)]
