# Save the Children CEO says aid getting into Gaza is "woefully inadequate"
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [January 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w)
*  We're joined now by Save the Children CEO, Janti Sarebdo. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to ask you, Janti, because you were just back from the region, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=4.8s)]
*  you were looking into how much aid can get into Gaza right now to help the kids you are so concerned about. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  What did you learn? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=15.4s)]
*  Thanks, Margaret. Yes, I've just come back after a little over 10 days in the region. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=17.6s)]
*  I made it all the way to the border, the Rafa crossing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=23.2s)]
*  I managed to see the hundreds and hundreds of trucks waiting in Arish to get in. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=27.8s)]
*  And what we're seeing is still that getting aid into Gaza is still woefully inadequate. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=32.8s)]
*  We're looking at about 130, 150 trucks getting in a day on a good day. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=38.6s)]
*  When I was there, it was actually not a good day. I think less than 100 came in. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=44.0s)]
*  And let's remind ourselves that before October 7th, about 500 trucks made it into Gaza every day [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=48.72s)]
*  and a mixture of aid and commercial supplies. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=56.2s)]
*  So the number that is getting through is still woefully inadequate, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=59.0s)]
*  especially because the needs, of course, have skyrocketed. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=62.8s)]
*  And even if trucks come in, it is an incredibly cumbersome process. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=65.8s)]
*  Many, many trucks offload and onload along the way. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=70.4s)]
*  And then when you're into Rafa to get real last mile delivery or last hundred yards delivery, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=74.4s)]
*  getting shots in arms of children who need vaccinations, getting food, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=80.6s)]
*  medical supplies to hospital, getting water to people, that is still incredibly difficult. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=85.0s)]
*  There's a one and a half million people stranded in Rafa. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  People are everywhere. The streets are crowded. Trucks and vans have actually difficulty moving. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=94.19999999999999s)]
*  And it's been almost impossible to get any supplies into the north of Gaza, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=100.0s)]
*  where there are still hundreds of thousands of people stranded. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=105.0s)]
*  I mean, those pictures are just incredible showing what that area of Rafa was like. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=109.0s)]
*  And now just the concentration of humanity stuck there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=114.0s)]
*  I know that you have joined with other humanitarian organizations to say that this is unlike any conflict [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=119.2s)]
*  that you have ever seen in all your years of work. What makes it so different? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=126.0s)]
*  It really, really is. I mean, people have nowhere to go. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=134.6s)]
*  We work in a lot of other crises from Afghanistan to Sudan to Ukraine. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=138.6s)]
*  But there, and the situation is also bad. Let me just put that out there. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=143.6s)]
*  But there, there is still an opportunity for people to flee. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=147.6s)]
*  Here in Gaza, it is completely impossible. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=151.6s)]
*  And the density of the people on a very small space of land now with the constant bombardment [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=153.6s)]
*  after the now long forgotten humanitarian pause we had in November, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=161.6s)]
*  it is just, it makes it almost impossible to do at scale humanitarian responses. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=165.6s)]
*  So that makes it hard. We're also incredibly concerned about the health situation, vastly deteriorating. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=172.6s)]
*  Only a few hospitals are still really operational. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=178.6s)]
*  And it means that children in particular who are more vulnerable [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=181.6s)]
*  are also suffering from what ought to be resolvable, treatable illnesses, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=184.6s)]
*  infections, respiratory tract diseases, diarrhea, now become life threatening [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=190.6s)]
*  because there are no medicine to actually treat them. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=196.6s)]
*  The UN agency in Gaza said its services are collapsing as aid is now being paused [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=199.6s)]
*  because of this revelation by Israel that 12 people were tied to the attack on October 7th. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=206.6s)]
*  I know the Israeli government is saying other aid organizations not tainted with terrorism can step in. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=213.6s)]
*  You're one of those aid organizations. Can you handle stepping in? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=219.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think that I personally we think that's an example of some magical thinking. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=225.6s)]
*  There is no way that the collective humanitarian sector can completely replace UNRWA. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=231.6s)]
*  You know, in the short space of time that that will be necessary. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=238.6s)]
*  Let's not forget UNRWA has had 13,000 staff in Gaza. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=241.6s)]
*  Save the Children currently has 23, 23 staff in Gaza. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=246.6s)]
*  Yes, and hundreds of community volunteers. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=251.6s)]
*  And many aid organizations are in the same spot. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MLKpfnyb_w&t=253.6s)]
