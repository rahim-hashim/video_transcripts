# Trump cuts G7 trip short as Israel and Iran continue to trade strikes
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM)
*  Meanwhile, President Trump posting to social media just moments ago calling for the immediate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=0.0s)]
*  evacuation of Iran's capital while the country trades airstrikes with Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=5.36s)]
*  The Post said quote, Iran should have signed the deal. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=10.86s)]
*  I told them to sign. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  What a shame and waste of human life. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=16.26s)]
*  Simply stated, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  I said it over and over again. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=23.12s)]
*  Everyone should immediately evacuate to run. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=26.12s)]
*  This spring in CBS News, congressional reporter Torian Smoltorian, that somewhat foreboding [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=29.36s)]
*  message from the president and you have some news about a change in travel plans for President [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=33.92s)]
*  Trump as well. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=38.92s)]
*  Yeah, so this appears to be a shifting in tone from President Trump from earlier today. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=40.92s)]
*  He emanated optimism that the United States could work out a deal with Iran to ending [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=48.72s)]
*  program. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=56.48s)]
*  Later in the day, as we see from this true social post, he's growing a bit frustrated [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=57.959999999999994s)]
*  at the fact that this also comes on the heels of those airstrikes that we saw between the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=62.76s)]
*  two countries in Israel and Iran. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=68.16s)]
*  When asked about this earlier today, this is what he had to say about the fate of a [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=70.96s)]
*  nuclear program deal between the two countries. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  I think Iran basically is at the negotiating table. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=79.6s)]
*  They want to make a deal. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=82.4s)]
*  And as soon as I leave here, we're going to be doing something. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=84.4s)]
*  But I have to leave here. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=87.92s)]
*  I have this commitment. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=88.92s)]
*  I have a lot of commitments. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=89.92s)]
*  I have a commitment to a lot of countries, including the UK, where we just signed our [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=90.92s)]
*  deal. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=95.08000000000001s)]
*  Now a White House official confirmed to CBS News that President Donald Trump is refusing [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=98.44000000000001s)]
*  to sign a resolution at the G7 summit from world leaders that would essentially call [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  for de-escalation between Israel and Iran. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=111.28s)]
*  That official saying that Donald Trump would prefer to work unilaterally as he comes to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=114.04s)]
*  these negotiations. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=119.28s)]
*  But that update that you hinted at, Liz, was President Donald Trump is already on his way [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=120.64s)]
*  back to the United States. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=124.8s)]
*  No mention on why exactly outside of the fact, and this is according to Caroline Levitt, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=126.6s)]
*  White House press secretary, he's attending to important matters here in the states. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=131.52s)]
*  But it sounds like in that soundbite, though, Tori, and he alluded to another deal that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=136.48s)]
*  was made, the president, UK Prime Minister Stammer sealing a trade deal at the G7 summit. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=139.72s)]
*  Tell us what we know about that agreement. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=145.72s)]
*  Yeah, pretty big deal that he touted during the summit. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=150.28s)]
*  He came out with the prime minister holding and at one point dropping the signed deal [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=153.4s)]
*  from his hands. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=158.72s)]
*  But in that, though, this has to deal with aerospace automobiles, including jet engines. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=159.72s)]
*  It would essentially lower tariffs on those significant matters, including the first [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=164.88s)]
*  100,000 cars imported into the United States from Britain. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=172.2s)]
*  We know that this is a deal that has been in the works for quite a bit, some time. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  But this is the formal agreement that both sides have signed now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=182.88s)]
*  Here's President Trump speaking more on that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=187.04s)]
*  We just signed it and it's done. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  And so we have our trade agreement with the European Union. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=192.56s)]
*  And it's a fair deal for both. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=197.84s)]
*  It'll produce a lot of jobs, a lot of income. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=199.44s)]
*  And we have many, many other ones coming. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=203.12s)]
*  But you see the level of enthusiasm is very good. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  But the relationship that we have is fantastic. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=210.16000000000003s)]
*  Still in aluminum tariffs are still in question. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=212.52s)]
*  We were told by the White House that Secretary Lutnick will determine a quota for products [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=219.16000000000003s)]
*  that would be taxed at that 25 percent as part of this deal. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=224.8s)]
*  But the president is still working out other deals with other countries. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=230.68s)]
*  Canada, obviously a big trading partner for the U.S. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=233.4s)]
*  President Trump said that conversations went well with Prime Minister Mark Carney today. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  And Mark Carney said that he believes talks with President Trump went fantastic. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=242.68s)]
*  Liz? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=247.88s)]
*  Torian Small, thank you so much. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=248.88s)]
*  Live outside the White House for us. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG3FR3POgqM&t=250.76s)]
