# The importance of Iran's Fordo nuclear site
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk)
*  The International Atomic Energy Agency reported today that overnight Israeli airstrikes hit [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=0.0s)]
*  two Iranian centrifuge facilities. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=5.2s)]
*  One of Israel's stated goals for its current offensive is destroying Iran's ability to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=7.96s)]
*  build a nuclear bomb. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=12.6s)]
*  So far, attacks have targeted Iran's above-ground facilities. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  But one of the sites Israel views as critical to destroy is hundreds of feet underground. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=18.44s)]
*  Retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Charlie Faint joins us now to explain why destroying [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=24.0s)]
*  the underground Fordow facility is a key mission for Israel and what tools could help. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=28.78s)]
*  He's also the managing editor for the Modern War Institute at West Point. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=34.58s)]
*  Charlie, thanks for being here. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=38.5s)]
*  Fordow is part of a handful of sensitive sites that are essential for Iran's nuclear program. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=41.06s)]
*  As you can see on this map, there are several represented here, south of Tehran, the capital. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  Fordow is the largest and most important one and the one that we're going to discuss here briefly. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=53.699999999999996s)]
*  Many of the other sites have already been successfully attacked by Israeli forces, but [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=58.78s)]
*  Fordow has not. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=62.06s)]
*  One of the reasons for this is that as you see in this build that Fordow is heavily protected. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=63.66s)]
*  It's deep in the mountains, hundreds of feet underground, where it is very hard to get [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=70.9s)]
*  after this sensitive site. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=74.7s)]
*  This one in particular has been declared by the Israelis from the Prime Minister on down [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=77.02s)]
*  as essential to taking out as part of Israel's strategic war aims. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=80.72s)]
*  So we suspect that we'll see some type of action on this in the very near future. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=85.44s)]
*  One form that this action may take is in the form of this, which is the Massive Ordnance [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=90.76s)]
*  Penetrator GBU-57. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  As you can see from this slide, this is a massive weapon. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=102.44s)]
*  It's 30,000 pounds, it's more than 20 feet long, and it's designed to go into a target [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=106.08s)]
*  and blow it up from the inside versus surface bombs, which hit the surface and blow outward. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=111.36s)]
*  This one's designed to go deep into the ground and explode out. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=117.6s)]
*  So for purposes of comparison, a standard penetrator bomb in what we call the Bunkerbuster [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=120.66s)]
*  family might be either 2,000 pounds or 5,000 pounds. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=125.68s)]
*  This one is 30,000 pounds. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=129.78s)]
*  So it is so big, there's only one platform in the world that we know of that can launch [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=131.68s)]
*  it, and that's the US B-2 bomber. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=136.44s)]
*  So right now we don't know if that is going to be used against the Fordow target or if [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=138.64s)]
*  some other means might be to secure it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=144.0s)]
*  For example, they might use drones, might send a force in on the ground, or they might [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  decide that it's already been neutralized enough that they don't need to go in to do [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=150.73999999999998s)]
*  anything about it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  However, if they do go in to do something about it, it might look something like this. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=155.6s)]
*  A site as secure and as important as Fordow might require multiple hits. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=162.56s)]
*  So what might happen in a GBU use against this specific hard target is one bomb might [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=167.36s)]
*  go in like you saw just now to pave the way for a second bomb to go in to destroy it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=172.60000000000002s)]
*  So one GBU would hit, clear the way. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=180.12s)]
*  A second GBU would go in and seal off that and make sure that target was no longer a [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  threat. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  A site is so important, and everyone needs to understand this, is because of what it [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=188.76s)]
*  contributes to Iran's nuclear program. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=193.76s)]
*  For use in a civilian function like a nuclear reactor, you want uranium that's refined [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=196.76s)]
*  to about 5%. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  Any time you get above 60%, you start looking at highly sophisticated refinement processes [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  that can be used for a lot of nuclear weapons. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=207.67999999999998s)]
*  So we've known for years that Iran had the ability to refine to 60%. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=210.11999999999998s)]
*  There are recent reports that they're going over 80%, and it's a short jump from 80, 60%, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=214.88s)]
*  all the way up to 90, which is what we consider weapons grade. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=221.44s)]
*  So the suspicion that Iran might soon have a breakout capability to build and employ [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=224.48s)]
*  nuclear weapons is why this is so important, why we expect we'll see some type of action [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=229.76s)]
*  against Fordow in the very near future. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=233.6s)]
*  Charlie Fainte, thank you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ko12JssOk&t=235.88s)]
