# New details on moments leading up to Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's killing
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0)
*  So we begin in the Middle East this morning where Israel has confirmed its forces have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=0.0s)]
*  killed the alleged mastermind of Hamas's October 7th attacks, Yair Sinwar. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=5.64s)]
*  His death marks a major development in the war in the Middle East, with Israeli Prime [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=10.76s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling this the beginning of the end. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=15.36s)]
*  Speaking moments ago in Berlin, President Biden said there could now be a better future [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=19.6s)]
*  for Gaza without Hamas. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=24.18s)]
*  While Vice President Kamala Harris said it presents an opportunity to end the war. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=26.94s)]
*  Now, despite his death, the IDF is continuing its operations both in Gaza and Lebanon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=31.580000000000002s)]
*  And this morning, Hezbollah has fired more projectiles into northern Israel. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=38.14s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News reporter Hailey Ott, who is following all of these threads for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=42.46s)]
*  us from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=46.5s)]
*  Hailey, what more are we learning about the operation to kill Sinwar? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=47.78s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=54.5s)]
*  Some new details from the Israeli military on that operation which killed Hamas leader [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=55.82s)]
*  Yahya Sinwar, including a drone video released by the IDF. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=61.38s)]
*  So we're hearing that it was part of a routine patrol in southern Gaza, that this patrol [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=66.9s)]
*  didn't have any specific intelligence about Sinwar's location. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=74.98s)]
*  They weren't specifically pursuing him. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=78.58s)]
*  And soldiers came across Hamas militants. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=81.36s)]
*  There was a firefight and one militant ran into a ruined building that was nearby. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=84.26s)]
*  Then IDF soldiers sent a drone with a camera on it into that building to look around and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=91.1s)]
*  see what was going on. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=97.46s)]
*  That's the footage that the IDF has released. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=98.74s)]
*  We can't independently verify that footage, but it shows what appears to be a man covered [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=101.58s)]
*  in dust. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=106.9s)]
*  His face is covered. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=107.9s)]
*  He's sitting in a chair in a ruined space and he's not moving very much. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=109.06s)]
*  He looks wounded and then he notices the drone sort of behind him and turns and throws something [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  at it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=120.84s)]
*  Shortly after that, Israeli forces fired on that building. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=122.12s)]
*  It collapsed and Sinwar, who they say is the man pictured in that drone video, was killed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=125.84s)]
*  I saw there were celebrations across Israel. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  What else, what other types of reaction have you seen there to this development? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=136.0s)]
*  Yes, so Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made public remarks. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=141.48s)]
*  He said that Sinwar's death had settled the score for that brutal attack by Hamas on October [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=147.16s)]
*  7th last year, but that the war in Gaza was very much ongoing and that the goal now was [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  to secure the release of those remaining hostages that are still in Gaza. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  Many members of those families of the hostages, loved ones of the hostages took to the streets [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=166.2s)]
*  in Tel Aviv last night protesting to bring attention to their loved ones' plights and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=172.0s)]
*  also making the point that they were concerned that perhaps Sinwar's death might change the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  calculus within Gaza, might actually endanger those hostages. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=187.0s)]
*  We're also hearing this morning from a Hamas official who says that Sinwar is a leader [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=193.12s)]
*  of a movement and that while the movement is sad that that leader has been killed, it [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=199.88000000000002s)]
*  will continue on. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  That echoes reporting from our colleague, reporter and producer Marwan El-Ghul in Gaza, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=207.56s)]
*  who spoke to people who said that even though Sinwar has been killed, his mission lives [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=213.24s)]
*  on beyond him. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=219.72000000000003s)]
*  And there has been more fighting today. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=221.48s)]
*  Can you tell us about that? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=223.72s)]
*  Yes, all of this has taken place against the backdrop of continued fighting. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=225.64s)]
*  Actually, this morning there were three gunmen who entered Israeli territory via Jordan. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=232.2s)]
*  That is a location that we haven't seen fighting up until this point. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=240.12s)]
*  Two of them were killed according to the IDF, but they're in pursuit of one who potentially [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  got away. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  The fight is currently ongoing. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=250.8s)]
*  There were rockets fired from Lebanon into northern Israel this morning. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=252.72s)]
*  Israel warned about 20 villages to evacuate. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=258.48s)]
*  That indicates that there could be airstrikes coming in those locations there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=262.0s)]
*  And the fighting in Gaza has continued, including in that northern area where there have been [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=266.24s)]
*  those heightened operations recently. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=270.92s)]
*  Humanitarian officials have said now that the situation in Gaza in terms of aid and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  access to sort of basic necessities has become so dire, it's like a trickle, and people there [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=278.96s)]
*  are running out of basically everything they would need to survive. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=284.68s)]
*  Very serious. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=288.56s)]
*  Haley Ott, thank you for that update. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kFlExa1bt0&t=289.56s)]
