*  The parents of Hirsch Goldberg-Polin worked tirelessly to keep Israel's hostage crisis [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=36.56s)]
*  on the global stage. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=41.76s)]
*  Even addressing last month's Democratic Party convention. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=45.84s)]

*  Following the announcement the 23-year-old Israeli American's remains had been recovered [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=59.92s)]

*  The bodies of five other hostages have also been recovered. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=75.68s)]

*  According to the Israeli media, preliminary autopsy reports have found all six were shot in the head. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=87.44s)]
*  The Israeli military has said Hamas was responsible for their brutal murderers [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  and also said the remains were discovered not far from where another hostage, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=98.4s)]
*  Farhan Al-Khadi, was found alive just last week. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=102.32s)]
*  The news of the killings has triggered grief and anger across Israel, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=106.8s)]
*  with many Israelis blaming the deaths on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=111.44s)]
*  for, in their words, sabotaging the hostage release and ceasefire deal with Hamas [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=115.6s)]
*  that's been under negotiation for months. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=120.08s)]
*  All they care about is the politics and they didn't approve to do a deal with Hamas and so [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  our loved ones are still there and currently we don't see the horizon and don't see [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=128.0s)]
*  know when they will be back with us. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=132.0s)]
*  In a taped address, Netanyahu said the Israeli government is committed to continue striving [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=135.84s)]
*  for a deal that will return all of the hostages. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=141.2s)]
*  While President Biden told reporters it was time to end the war on Gaza. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=145.04s)]
*  I think we're on the verge of having an agreement and just time to end it, time to finish it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=149.76s)]
*  But until an agreement is reached, the violence rages on, even as the U.N. attempts to vaccinate [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=155.44s)]
*  640,000 Palestinian children to prevent a major outbreak of polio in Gaza. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=160.88s)]
*  And based on the framework of a deal Israel and Hamas have already agreed to, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=167.6s)]
*  three of the six hostages who were killed would have been released as part of what's called the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=172.32s)]
*  humanitarian category during the first phase of an eventual ceasefire agreement, Nancy, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=177.2s)]
*  and Hirsch Goldberg-Polin would have been one of them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-U26Z2pOk&t=183.04s)]
