# State Department fields questions about alleged leak of documents showing Iran's attack plans
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8)
*  As promised, when we see it, you see it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's go to our camera inside the U.S. State Department right now. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  And a lot of questions starting out a news conference about that leaked document detailing [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=6.0s)]
*  plans for Israel's attack against Iran. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=10.66s)]
*  I want to ask about the intel leak on potential Israeli response plans to Iran. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=13.16s)]
*  Some Republicans yesterday and today are criticizing administration officials for saying they're [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=22.1s)]
*  deeply concerned but otherwise not taking this seriously enough. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=27.24s)]
*  What's your response to that? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=30.84s)]
*  And yesterday you said this topic didn't come up in any of the Secretary's bilats, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=33.239999999999995s)]
*  now that he's in the region and having bilats today, is that still the case? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=37.04s)]
*  So I don't have anything to read out on the Secretary's government-to-government [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  engagements today beyond some of the readouts that we've already made public, and so I [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=46.36s)]
*  would refer you back to there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=50.28s)]
*  Look, as it relates to the issue surrounding the unauthorized disclosure, I think many [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=52.24s)]
*  of you have seen the statement from the FBI who have indicated that they are investigating [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  They've announced that, and I will defer to them to speak to it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  Certainly we would take any unauthorized disclosure as something that we take very seriously, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=68.84s)]
*  and it is of course incredibly concerning. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=75.44s)]
*  There are appropriate entities of the U.S. government that are the appropriate authorities [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=78.8s)]
*  for these kinds of things, and we of course will defer to them when these things happen. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=85.0s)]
*  Simon, go ahead. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=90.6s)]
*  Can we come to Lebanon? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=92.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  France is hosting a conference to try to make some progress on the issue. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  Does the U.S. sort of support the French initiative to hold this conference, and what are you [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=99.6s)]
*  hoping will be agreed to? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=103.8s)]
*  Well, look, we of course are always eager to engage with partners on important issues, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=105.2s)]
*  including what is currently happening in Lebanon. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=112.8s)]
*  We will have representation at this conference. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  We'll hopefully be in a place to announce that in the next day or so, so stay tuned [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=118.8s)]
*  on that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  But look, when it comes to the Middle East, France has been a vital partner in continuing [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  support for, in the context of Gaza of course, trying to get us to a ceasefire. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=131.8s)]
*  And similarly, we know that they share our goal as it relates to Lebanon for creating [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=137.4s)]
*  the conditions that will allow civilians on both sides of the blue line to return to their [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=142.4s)]
*  homes, and we know that they also would like to see 1701 effectively implemented. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  I have no doubt that a lot of these things will be talked about, as well as ways in which [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=152.10000000000002s)]
*  countries in this conference can continue to support humanitarian efforts in Lebanon [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=157.5s)]
*  as well. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=161.3s)]
*  I expect all of this to be discussed, but I don't want to get ahead of the conference. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=162.3s)]
*  You mentioned the U.S. participation, but it hasn't been announced as part of the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=165.1s)]
*  Secretary's travels, so do you expect Secretary... [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=170.9s)]
*  I don't have any announcements to offer as it relates to the Secretary's travel. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=173.1s)]
*  The Secretary, we expect, will be in the Middle East region, as we've been talking about this [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=177.5s)]
*  whole week, but we will have participation at a senior level at the conference. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=182.3s)]
*  Okay, so if you don't send the Secretary, doesn't that sort of signal some lesser support [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=187.10000000000002s)]
*  for this initiative? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=196.10000000000002s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=197.3s)]
*  We will have senior level representation, and I will say that this is something that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=198.8s)]
*  the Secretary himself will continue to be personally engaged on. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=202.10000000000002s)]
*  He's certainly talking about the issues surrounding Lebanon while he is on his travel. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=205.9s)]
*  He is talking about it with important counterparts and interlocutors, and whatever our representation [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=210.9s)]
*  ends up looking like in Paris, we, of course, will be very latched up with the totality [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=217.1s)]
*  of the department. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=224.9s)]
*  Again, I think we kind of get into this back and forth of whether just simply presence [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=225.9s)]
*  somewhere indicates any kind of prioritization, and that certainly is not the case. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=232.5s)]
*  This is a priority for the Secretary. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=236.70000000000002s)]
*  The Secretary is on travel in other parts of the world right now, but this is a vital [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=238.3s)]
*  issue to him, and we will make sure that there is a senior level of representation from the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=243.3s)]
*  United States at it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=247.5s)]
*  And if the other countries there, specifically France, would like to see a ceasefire, your [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=248.5s)]
*  position most recently seems to be that you're not calling for an immediate ceasefire. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=254.3s)]
*  So is this administration out of line with European allies particularly, but allies who [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=261.1s)]
*  would like to see this conflict come to an end? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=270.90000000000003s)]
*  There's a – look, Simon, I will let European allies speak for themselves, but we know that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=274.1s)]
*  there's a convergence between us and our European allies on what we all want to see, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=278.06s)]
*  and what we all want to see ultimately is the effective implementation of 1701, but [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=282.66s)]
*  importantly the conditions created so that civilians can return to their homes on both [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=287.78s)]
*  sides of the blue line. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=293.3s)]
*  And perhaps even broader than that, we want to see the country of Lebanon be able to stand [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=294.65999999999997s)]
*  on its own two feet out of the stranglehold from Hezbollah. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=302.26s)]
*  I am not going to speculate on what proposals and ideas may come from the conference. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=306.97999999999996s)]
*  I think that's the purpose of these kinds of engagements, to have these important conversations [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=311.46s)]
*  in multilateral settings, and we'll let that process move forward. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=315.88s)]
*  Jenny, go ahead. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=319.44s)]
*  I want to ask about the Israeli strike near a hospital in southern Beirut. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=320.44s)]
*  Does the U.S. have comment on the strike that killed more than a dozen people and left [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=322.92s)]
*  dozens more injured? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=326.56s)]
*  So I've seen that reporting, Jenny. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=328.16s)]
*  I don't have any specifics that I can offer as it relates to that operation. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=330.2s)]
*  We of course will let the IDF and the Israelis speak to the kinds of operations that they [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=335.36s)]
*  are conducting. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  Look, we have been as clear as we have been that when it comes to operations that the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=341.0s)]
*  IDF is undertaking to degrade Hezbollah, which we of course support, that every possible [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=347.79999999999995s)]
*  measure needs to be taken to minimize impact on civilians, to minimize civilian casualties, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=352.68s)]
*  and that one step beyond that, every possible measure needs to be taken so that civilian [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=360.28s)]
*  infrastructure, whether it be hospitals, schools, anything in that category, that impact on [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  that needs to be minimized as well. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=371.96s)]
*  We have asked the Israelis for additional information as it relates to this particular [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=373.92s)]
*  strike, but I don't have anything to offer as it relates to that. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=380.08s)]
*  I think let's also not lose sight on the fact that Hezbollah is a terrorist organization [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=383.6s)]
*  that does have deep-rooted infrastructure in various corners of Lebanese society, and [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=388.96s)]
*  part of that has included Hezbollah co-locating itself with civilian infrastructure. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=398.79999999999995s)]
*  Again, as it relates to this particular hospital, I don't have any insight that I can offer [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  from up here, but this is something we'll continue to engage on directly with the Israelis. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=407.03999999999996s)]
*  So once again, more questions directed there at the State Department on what's going on [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=412.4s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=416.32s)]
*  We'll continue watching that and more information coming. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sVmMUzQXh8&t=417.32s)]
