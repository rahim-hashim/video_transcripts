# Senior Hezbollah commander killed in Beirut strike, Israel says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM)
*  As we mentioned, Israel launched a strike Friday on a southern neighborhood in Lebanon's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=0.0s)]
*  capital city of Beirut. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=5.16s)]
*  The Israeli military says the attack killed a Hezbollah commander and 10 operatives with [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=7.04s)]
*  the Iranian-backed group. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=11.96s)]
*  And the strike comes just days after pagers and walkie-talkies carried by members of Hezbollah [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=14.52s)]
*  exploded, killing dozens and injuring thousands. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=19.28s)]
*  CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd joins us now for our weekly national [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=22.96s)]
*  security wrap-up. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=27.68s)]
*  So Sam, the situation in the Middle East is constantly changing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=29.639999999999997s)]
*  What have we learned about this latest string of military action taken by Israel and how [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=33.6s)]
*  much they are actually saying they are doing and looking to do? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=41.08s)]
*  Well, Lana, the backdrop here, of course, is that Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=46.16s)]
*  in a series of cross-border strikes since Hamas' terrorist attack against Israel on [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=50.92s)]
*  October 7th. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=55.72s)]
*  This week, the situation escalated further. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=57.24s)]
*  In what was likely a months-long intelligence operation, Israel was reportedly able to physically [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=59.88s)]
*  sabotage Hezbollah's communications devices, both pagers and walkie-talkies. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=66.9s)]
*  Then, in a coordinated fashion this week in two stages, Israel reportedly was able to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=72.04s)]
*  detonate these communications devices, leaving 37 dead and thousands injured. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=78.16s)]
*  Following that disruption to Hezbollah's communications devices, Israel then, on Friday, launched [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=85.0s)]
*  a targeted airstrike that reportedly killed a leader of Hezbollah's Radwan group, one [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  of their special forces group, an individual named Ibrahim Akhil, who has been wanted by [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  the United States for his role in bombings of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and Marine barracks [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=102.06s)]
*  in the 1980s. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  Now, the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, had said that Israel's actions constitute [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  a declaration of war, and all are waiting to see whether Hezbollah has both the intent [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=114.76s)]
*  and the capabilities to escalate tensions with Israel further in retaliation for the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=119.98s)]
*  actions this week, Lana. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=124.84s)]
*  Alright, Sam, there is a lot happening in the world. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=126.36000000000001s)]
*  The FBI said they took down a Chinese botnet that infiltrated hundreds of thousands of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=130.08s)]
*  devices. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=134.8s)]
*  Chinese leaders, other world leaders, all heading here to the United States, to New [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=135.84s)]
*  York specifically, for the United Nations General Assembly. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=140.52s)]
*  Tell us what you're going to be looking out for. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=144.44s)]
*  Well, when the UN General Assembly or UNGA kicks off next week, more than 140 heads of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=146.4s)]
*  state are expected in New York, not to mention many ministers, private sector CEOs, and more. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=151.32000000000002s)]
*  President Biden is due to speak at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday, and member [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=158.52s)]
*  states will be giving speeches over the course of six days. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=163.16s)]
*  The theme of this year's UN General Assembly is leaving no one behind. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=166.84s)]
*  There will be a summit for the future that focuses on complex global challenges like [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=171.32s)]
*  inequality and poverty. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=175.28s)]
*  There will be a summit of the global coalition to address synthetic drug threats and a very [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=176.96s)]
*  heavy focus on the war in the Middle East, the war in Ukraine, and likely on issues like [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=182.72s)]
*  climate change. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=187.72s)]
*  We understand that after President Biden leaves New York, he will host President Zelensky [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=189.08s)]
*  of Ukraine at the White House on Thursday. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=194.2s)]
*  And I'll be looking to see whether there is any progress made on the war in the Middle [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=197.04s)]
*  East, the situation in Ukraine, and whether world leaders are actually able to come together [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=201.72s)]
*  to make actionable commitments to key global challenges, Lana. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=206.72s)]
*  All right, Sam Vinograd, thank you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=209.96s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkCIosx7QM&t=211.64s)]
