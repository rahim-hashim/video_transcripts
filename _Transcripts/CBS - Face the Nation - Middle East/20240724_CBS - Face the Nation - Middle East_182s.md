# What to expect from Netanyahu's address to Congress
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA)
*  We start this morning with this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=0.0s)]
*  In just a few hours, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will address a joint meeting [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=2.24s)]
*  of Congress. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  He's also expected to meet with President Biden, Vice President Harris, and former President [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  Trump this week. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=11.9s)]
*  CBS News congressional correspondent Scott McFarland is following all the action on Capitol [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=13.1s)]
*  Hill, and he joins me now to discuss. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  So Scott, what are we expecting to hear from the PM when he addresses members of Congress? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=19.82s)]
*  And what are you hearing from lawmakers ahead of the address? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=25.580000000000002s)]
*  When he addresses this joint meeting of Congress, Vlad, he is in effect addressing the nation [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=28.76s)]
*  and the world, talking about the road ahead with the war in Gaza. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=33.96s)]
*  But at the same time, Vlad, he's really spotlighting divisions inside the Congress over Israel's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  handling of this war. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=45.94s)]
*  There are going to be dozens of Democrats who don't attend, who notoriously boycott [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=46.94s)]
*  address by Netanyahu because there are concerns about how he's administering the war, that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=54.14s)]
*  he's using the Congress to try to bolster his own political support back home, and that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=60.54s)]
*  at this moment, they're better off not attending. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=65.53999999999999s)]
*  This is including some of the heaviest hitters in Congress. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=68.46s)]
*  Patty Murray, one of the top ranking Senate Democrats, will not attend. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi, former House speaker this morning, revealed she will not attend. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=76.06s)]
*  There are dozens and dozens of congressional Democrats who will have empty seats in the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=81.1s)]
*  chamber, making a statement metaphorically, as Prime Minister Netanyahu makes a statement [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=84.86s)]
*  literally. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=90.89999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, Vlad, outside the Capitol complex, they have re-erected this tall black metal [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=91.89999999999999s)]
*  fencing, the same kind we saw after January 6th, the same kind they've been putting in [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=96.78s)]
*  place during State of the Union addresses. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=101.6s)]
*  There are concerns about the size and magnitude of protests that will gather near the Capitol [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=104.78s)]
*  ahead of and during Prime Minister Netanyahu's address. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=108.9s)]
*  Scott, the other question, of course, is who the Prime Minister is meeting with. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=112.86s)]
*  He's not only meeting with the President of the United States and the Vice President, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=118.98s)]
*  he's also meeting with the former President of the United States. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=122.34s)]
*  This is sort of interesting to a lot of people because at this point in time, there is only [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=125.18s)]
*  one commander in chief. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=130.38s)]
*  Have lawmakers said anything about why perhaps Netanyahu feels the need to meet with former [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=132.4s)]
*  President Trump? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=136.34s)]
*  That's going to come up as part of the conversation today, I suspect. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=138.48s)]
*  That meeting on Friday at Mar-a-Lago is noticeable on the calendar. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=141.96s)]
*  Also noticeable that the Prime Minister is meeting not just with President Biden and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=145.88s)]
*  Vice President Harris, also though, attending a memorial service for the late Senator Joe [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=149.88s)]
*  Lieberman today. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=154.16s)]
*  Kind of a packed calendar for Prime Minister Netanyahu while he's in the United States. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=155.36s)]
*  May not be a surprise he's having an audience with former President Trump, both of whom [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=159.0s)]
*  are trying to bolster their conservative political supports in their respective countries. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=164.68s)]
*  But he really is a full docket for the Prime Minister during his trip here to the states. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=170.24s)]
*  Yeah, indeed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  And you'll be following all of it for us, Scott, as always. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  We appreciate you, man. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=180.54000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1AFzb-arA&t=181.54000000000002s)]
