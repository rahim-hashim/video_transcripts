# Government funding deal would ban U.S. aid to UNRWA until 2025, sources say
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [March 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE)
*  Sources tell CBS News this spending bill, agreed to by congressional leaders and the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=0.0s)]
*  White House, will include a ban on all direct funding to the United Nations Agency for Palestinian [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=4.36s)]
*  Refugees until March 2025. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=10.92s)]
*  Israel has accused over a dozen UNRWA employees of participating in the October 7 attack. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=14.96s)]
*  Earlier today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Republican senators virtually [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  this less than a week after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for new elections [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=26.72s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=32.36s)]
*  Senate GOP leaders had this to say after the meeting. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=33.64s)]
*  I made it clear to him that it's not the business of the United States to be giving a Democratic [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=36.92s)]
*  ally advice about when to have an election or what kind of military campaign they may [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=43.32s)]
*  be conducting. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=50.0s)]
*  Our members conveyed to the Israeli Prime Minister our strong support for their efforts [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=51.72s)]
*  to defeat once and for all and get rid of the influence of Hamas. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=58.92s)]
*  And our Margaret Brennan is here with me now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=64.12s)]
*  Margaret, I know you've been doing a lot of reporting on this today, so what impact could [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  this ban on funding to UNRWA have on the distribution of aid to Gaza? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=69.48s)]
*  Well, currently, USAID has been paused because of the investigation that you mentioned into [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=74.12s)]
*  those allegations about the 12 employees, 12 among 13,000 employees. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=78.18s)]
*  But what this would immediately do, according to UNRWA, would have an immediate impact on [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=83.7s)]
*  those who are starving. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=88.10000000000001s)]
*  Remember, we're talking about famine-like conditions being imminent. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  So you are looking at the agency that has the most infrastructure to shelter, feed, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=93.5s)]
*  give any kind of medical support, now saying they don't know where their next few dollars [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=98.94000000000001s)]
*  are coming from. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=103.74000000000001s)]
*  So, the US is looking at the $40 million pledge today, but the US gives hundreds of millions. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=105.3s)]
*  But do we know what was behind the decision, or is it just that this investigation is still [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=110.3s)]
*  underway? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=114.22s)]
*  Well, two things. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=115.22s)]
*  In terms of the motivation of the Republicans who pushed for this block, it was very specifically [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=116.46s)]
*  to carry out the wishes of the Netanyahu government and also to respond to the allegations that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=123.38s)]
*  Israeli intelligence made about these 12. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=130.3s)]
*  The UN is conducting its own investigation. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=133.22s)]
*  It hasn't concluded it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=135.82s)]
*  And in fact, they have to revet employees. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=137.73999999999998s)]
*  The US intelligence community did not do their own assessment. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=140.14s)]
*  They are relying on the Israeli assessment and saying it was credible. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=143.0s)]
*  So that is still pending. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=146.66s)]
*  But in terms of the immediate funding, it was a Republican-led effort to do this. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=148.82s)]
*  There were Democrats like Senator Chris Van Hollen, who was on my program Sunday, warning [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=153.1s)]
*  that if this happens, it is going to have a really devastating impact. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=156.89999999999998s)]
*  Because what we know now, it's not just about getting trucks with food in or air dropping food. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=161.9s)]
*  It's distributing it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=167.06s)]
*  And when you don't have a network to distribute it, and Save the Children has told us no one [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=168.54s)]
*  can step in and do this other than UNRWA, UNICEF, others. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=172.46s)]
*  So to really gut that organization will have an impact. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=176.22s)]
*  The White House didn't want to, they claim, but they have gone along with in order to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=179.7s)]
*  avoid a government shutdown because this was tucked into a funding bill. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=184.62s)]
*  And then in terms of the prime minister's address to Senate Republicans today, what [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=190.72s)]
*  more do we know about his message to lawmakers? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=195.78s)]
*  And why did he specifically address Senate Republicans as opposed to senators as a whole? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=199.72s)]
*  Well, according to Senator Barrasso, one of the lead Senate Republicans, he asked the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=206.44s)]
*  prime minister to speak to them, and Senator Schumer was offered the choice and declined [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=211.56s)]
*  at the offer. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=217.36s)]
*  But this is a political punchback. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=218.56s)]
*  I mean, there's no question about this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=220.2s)]
*  This is a response to the fact that the majority leader who views himself in a unique role [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=222.0s)]
*  as the highest ranking Jewish official in American history to speak with the authority [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=227.56s)]
*  he felt he had on the moral issues he laid out in the speech. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=231.45999999999998s)]
*  His speech was very specific. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  He didn't just talk about Israeli elections. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=237.04s)]
*  He called for Palestinian leaders to step down. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  He called for Netanyahu to disavow the right wing extremists within his government who [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=241.95999999999998s)]
*  have used bigoted language and advocated for bigoted policies. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=247.16s)]
*  That's what he said in his speech. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=251.24s)]
*  So it wasn't just, you know, trying to unseat a leader. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=253.0s)]
*  It was very specific and driving towards a peace agreement. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=257.12s)]
*  But the Republican framing of this is that this was dirty politics or regime change. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=260.2s)]
*  And it's something that, of course, a number of Democratic officials raise their eyebrows [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=265.6s)]
*  how openly Benjamin Netanyahu voices influence in American politics. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=271.08s)]
*  Jake Sullivan went to the podium at the White House, the national security adviser, and said, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=277.24s)]
*  you know, basically no other foreign leader is on American airwaves speaking to American audiences [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=280.32s)]
*  quite so frequently. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  So he said it was... [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  And I guess what do you make of that? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=288.12s)]
*  Well, he has an important audience here in the United States. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=289.68s)]
*  The United States and Israel have this really unique relationship in terms of funding, military [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  intelligence support. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=297.88s)]
*  And also, this is... [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=298.88s)]
*  The Israeli government views their consulate in New York City to be their most important [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=301.56s)]
*  diplomatic outpost in the world because of the number of American Jews who live there [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=306.79999999999995s)]
*  in that city and their view that the diaspora has a vested interest in the future of the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  Jewish democratic state. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=316.55999999999995s)]
*  So there is a unique relationship there. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=318.0s)]
*  But the influence into American politics is where this is getting really dirty, really quick. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=320.23999999999995s)]
*  And you have... [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=326.4s)]
*  You see that playing out here now. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=327.4s)]
*  But this isn't the first time. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=329.64s)]
*  As you know, 2015, you remember Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to that joint session of Congress bypassing [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=330.76s)]
*  the president, Barack Obama, and going instead and dealing just with Republicans in control [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=336.56s)]
*  of the Congress. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=342.2s)]
*  That was hugely controversial and caused a diplomatic incident at the time. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=343.2s)]
*  And Speaker Mike Johnson even today saying he may invite the prime minister to address [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=346.76s)]
*  Congress again. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=350.84s)]
*  Margaret Brennan, we thank you so much for your expertise as always. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=351.84s)]
*  And of course, you can see more from Margaret on Face the Nation right here on CBS News [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqLtw5l3lOE&t=355.84000000000003s)]
