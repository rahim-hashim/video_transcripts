# Israel-Hamas hostage deal and temporary cease-fire explained
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4)
*  Chief Foreign Affairs correspondent and moderator of Face the Nation, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=0.0s)]
*  Marga Brennan, has closely followed the negotiations and joins us now. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  Marga, good morning. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=6.44s)]
*  Good morning to you, Vlad. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=8.24s)]
*  Based on your reporting, Marga, what can you tell us about how this deal came about? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=9.6s)]
*  Vlad, this was a very small group of negotiators over the past seven weeks. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=14.48s)]
*  It's been really intense pressure being exerted here. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=18.84s)]
*  The U.S. was talking to Israel's leaders, its intelligence agency, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=22.0s)]
*  and it was Qatar that was the conduit to Hamas. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=25.76s)]
*  Egyptian intelligence also helped. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=29.4s)]
*  So together, they put pressure on Hamas to provide proof of life [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=31.12s)]
*  for the 50 civilians expected to be first released. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=34.8s)]
*  And then they got Israel to agree to allow in cooking oil and fuel [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=38.2s)]
*  for hospital generators to run and to release those Palestinian women [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  and children from detention centers and then both sides to halt fighting [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=46.16s)]
*  for these short-term ceasefires that could last four days or more. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  Now, we have come close on at least two occasions, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=54.36s)]
*  once at the end of October and a few weeks ago, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=57.24s)]
*  but this is the very first time both sides have publicly agreed to the terms [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=59.36s)]
*  to help close this deal. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=64.4s)]
*  President Biden also picked up the phone himself. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=66.0s)]
*  And so, Marga, what do the phases of this deal entail? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, each day both sides have to take some steps. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=74.72s)]
*  So once the official halt to fighting is underway, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=76.8s)]
*  Hamas is expected to begin releasing women and children first, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=79.16s)]
*  at least three Americans in this first phase. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=82.48s)]
*  As I said, they provided proof of life for at least 50, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  but it is believed by the US that Hamas could potentially release more civilians. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=87.84s)]
*  Those men and foreign passport holders and soldiers would be in later phases. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=93.84s)]
*  So Hamas has an incentive to continue releasing people [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=98.76s)]
*  because the halt to fighting will be rolled over, extended each time. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=102.16s)]
*  Israel said for every 10 hostages, one more day of ceasefire. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=106.28s)]
*  And for every hostage they release, Israel will release more Palestinian prisoners. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=110.88s)]
*  So last night, Qatar said that number of prisoners will be increased in later stages. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  So I guess, Margaret, after the negotiated period of time, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=122.6s)]
*  which could be extended, do you expect that there will be a full resumption [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  of Israeli strikes once all the hostages are returned? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=130.72s)]
*  Well, Israel's prime minister said the war's not over, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=135.32s)]
*  so he's signaling the potential full resumption. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=137.68s)]
*  And it has been one of Israel's concerns that in any kind of pause, Hamas could regroup. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=140.48s)]
*  But this cessation of violence, the diplomacy around it, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=145.88s)]
*  could provide some diplomatic opportunity. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=148.72s)]
*  Big picture, the Biden administration has been pressing Israel [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=152.04s)]
*  and the surrounding Arab countries to help plan for a day after Hamas's collapse, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  including who will govern the two million Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  Margaret Brennan, tirelessly working her sources the last couple of days. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=166.16s)]
*  Margaret, thank you so much. We appreciate it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6ZCycq-t4&t=169.2s)]
