# Trump weighs in on Iran launching missiles toward Israel
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0)
*  Former President Donald Trump is spending the day campaigning in Wisconsin ahead of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=0.0s)]
*  tonight's vice presidential debate. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=4.08s)]
*  The Republican nominee made a stop at a manufacturing facility in a suburb of the state's capital, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=6.26s)]
*  Madison. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  He's also expected to speak about the economy in Milwaukee, which has the largest number [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  of Democratic voters in the state. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=16.06s)]
*  For more, let's bring in CBS News congressional correspondent Nicole Killian, who is in Winnocki, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=18.22s)]
*  Wisconsin, I believe is the pronunciation of that. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=22.96s)]
*  Nicole, how is the former president responding to this Iranian missile attack against Israel? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=26.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, we're actually in Milwaukee, awaiting the former president at an event that is centered [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=31.44s)]
*  around school choice. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=38.6s)]
*  You can probably see Congressman Brian Stile right behind me a short time ago. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=39.6s)]
*  He delivered remarks about the situation overseas, saying that this was an assault that was committed [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=44.08s)]
*  against the Israeli people and that his thoughts and prayers are with them and that the U.S. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=50.78s)]
*  should stand strong in defending and standing by its ally of Israel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=55.28s)]
*  So we expect to hear more, potentially, from the former president on this topic. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=61.4s)]
*  But he did weigh in earlier at a rally in Winnocki, as you mentioned, which was in a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  different part of the state. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=70.88s)]
*  But he basically said that the world is spiraling out of control and even suggested that we [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=72.56s)]
*  are on the precipice of World War III, a global catastrophe. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  He has also said through a series of social media posts that he feels that this may not [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=82.7s)]
*  have happened on his watch, that when he was the president, Iran was in check, to use his [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=89.98s)]
*  words. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=95.66s)]
*  So that has kind of been his response thus far with respect to the conflict. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=96.66s)]
*  He may take questions here, so we expect to ask him a bit more about his reaction and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=101.38s)]
*  what type of response he might take should he win the presidency in 2024. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=107.33999999999999s)]
*  But that being said, certainly it is one of those split-screen moments, if you will, Kaitlyn. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=114.25999999999999s)]
*  We kind of saw something similar take place yesterday with the former president being [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=118.78s)]
*  in Valdosta, kind of giving his take and trying to respond to Hurricane Helene, of course, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=123.34s)]
*  now, giving his impressions of what is happening abroad with respect to those Iranian strikes [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=130.38s)]
*  against Israel as we witness the administration responding and the former president responding [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=136.02s)]
*  as well. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=142.38000000000002s)]
*  Why turn his focus to this area? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=143.38000000000002s)]
*  Well, this is obviously a significant battleground, as you know, one of several battleground states [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=146.22s)]
*  that we are watching. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  And we know that the former president, in fact, was just here over the weekend. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=155.46s)]
*  But certainly what's interesting in particular about this visit is that he is visiting two [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=159.62s)]
*  Democratic strongholds in terms of Dane County, where he was earlier today, and here in Milwaukee, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=164.34s)]
*  where he'll be here a short time from now. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=169.86s)]
*  And this is really about potentially trying to slim the margins within the blue wall, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=171.78s)]
*  if you will. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=176.98000000000002s)]
*  We know this area is very vital for Democrats as well. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=177.98000000000002s)]
*  They want to hold on to Wisconsin. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=180.38s)]
*  But, you know, if the Trump team can kind of cut into some of those margins, visiting [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=182.14000000000001s)]
*  a place like Milwaukee, you know, kind of getting that local coverage, the campaign [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=187.18s)]
*  is certainly hoping that that kind of helps, particularly if they're able to run up the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=191.46s)]
*  totals in other, redder parts of the state. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=195.26000000000002s)]
*  So this is all part of a broader strategy as a whole, and probably not the former president's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=198.14000000000001s)]
*  last visit here to Wisconsin. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=203.18s)]
*  Nicole Killian, thank you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0kYJJZEO0&t=205.18s)]
