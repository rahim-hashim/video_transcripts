# Trump weighing U.S. involvement in Israel's effort to strike Iranian nuclear facilities
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY)
*  Hello everyone, I'm Major Garrett in Washington. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to The Takeout. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=2.56s)]
*  President Trump huddled with his national security team this afternoon after an abrupt [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=3.92s)]
*  departure from the G7 summit in Canada, the topic, you guessed it, Iran. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  On social media, the president said he knows where the supreme leader of that theocratic [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=13.16s)]
*  dictatorship is hiding, but for the time being, he wrote, the U.S. will not try to kill him. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=17.86s)]
*  The U.S. did move war planes into the region and reposition ships already there. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=25.68s)]
*  These military moves prompted a somewhat angry debate on social media within the president's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=30.64s)]
*  MAGA base about the possibility of a new war and how close Iran actually is to possessing [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=35.56s)]
*  a nuclear weapon and the means to deliver it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=43.0s)]
*  The question before the White House appears to be this. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=46.2s)]
*  Does it allow Israel alone to continue striking Iranian targets in the hope that it can degrade [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=49.36s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program, or does the U.S. come in with heavier bombs and bigger planes to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  inflict massive, possibly irrevocable damage? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=60.28s)]
*  CBS News can report the president is considering that second option. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=63.56s)]
*  For more on all this, I want to turn to Ed O'Keefe on the North Lawn of the White House. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=68.24s)]
*  Ed, it's been a very hectic day at the White House. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=71.84s)]
*  Pronouncements on social media, meetings in the Situation Room, catch us up. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=75.44s)]
*  Well, first off, let's recall he got here before the sun came up back from the G7 summit [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=81.52s)]
*  where he took off after midnight Alberta time and arrived back having told reporters on [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=86.64s)]
*  the way back that he's not seeking a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=92.72s)]
*  He wants the full end of Iran's nuclear program and that today was going to be sort of a wait [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=95.44s)]
*  and see, let's see where things are going kind of day. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=101.36s)]
*  And so he has spent the entire day out of the public eye ever since that interaction [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  with reporters early this morning, meeting, as you said, with his national security team, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=108.56s)]
*  including the vice president, Secretary of State, who doubles as the national security [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  adviser, his top Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, the defense secretary, Pete Hegsteth. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=116.4s)]
*  And the big issue was, should Israel and the United States join together to take out the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=121.44s)]
*  remainder of Iran's nuclear program, perhaps most notably the Fadao nuclear enrichment [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  site, which is embedded inside mountains and would require 30,000 pound bunker busting [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=133.84s)]
*  bombs dropped by B2s to penetrate and destroy, something that only the United States can [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=138.72s)]
*  do if they want to do it that way. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  Whether or not he made a decision on that at this hour just after 5 p.m. in the East, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=146.8s)]
*  we don't know. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=150.4s)]
*  And we haven't seen the president since he returned back to explain a decision or to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=151.68s)]
*  talk about today's developments or any other plans. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=156.24s)]
*  But we know that he's been meeting with his team to talk about it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  And of course, abruptly left that summit. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=163.68s)]
*  Part of the reason he left the summit, Major, and for those that followed along during the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=165.68s)]
*  first term and know the president's ebbs and flows, he's not a big fan of that specific [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  summit and most of these international meetings, simply because he just doesn't like all the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=174.4s)]
*  pleasantries and having to share the stage and prefers being back here with full control. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=179.44s)]
*  There may have also been some concerns about making sure he was able to keep on top of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  things should the situation get really fluid and be able to do that from here at the White [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=186.96s)]
*  House and in the Situation Room. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=191.68s)]
*  And we don't often talk about a social media debate about something within the MAGA movement [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=194.0s)]
*  because it is usually right aligned with the White House, but not today. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=199.68s)]
*  And there was a lot of skepticism within the MAGA world about the intelligence, about Iran, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=203.44s)]
*  so much so that Vice President J.D. Vance had to weigh in with an extensive reply. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=208.8s)]
*  Walk us through that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=214.16s)]
*  An extensive and really extraordinary kind of defense of the president in the social space [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=216.16s)]
*  that came around 11 a.m. this morning. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=220.72s)]
*  And he said, look, I'm seeing all this chatter, but I'm on the inside and I can tell you that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=222.72s)]
*  the president has been amazingly consistent over time about Iran and the fact that it [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  should not be able to develop a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=232.8s)]
*  In fact, 10 days or 10 years and one day ago when he began his first campaign for the White [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  House, ever since he's been consistent, Vance suggested, he raises some concerns. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=240.24s)]
*  They may want civilian nuclear energy, but then why are they developing it in a way that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=246.64s)]
*  would suggest, again, trying to a point where they can enrich that uranium and use it in [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=250.48s)]
*  weaponry? Hasn't seen a reason why they need to do that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=254.08s)]
*  Notes that the IAEA rules have been violated. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=257.2s)]
*  And then suggests, look, the president has shown remarkable restraint in keeping our [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=260.0s)]
*  military's focus on protecting our troops and protecting our citizens, which in the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=263.44s)]
*  last week he certainly has. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=267.2s)]
*  Vance continues, he may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=268.88s)]
*  That decision ultimately belongs to the president. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=274.16s)]
*  And of course, he says, people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=281.04s)]
*  That speaks to the criticism that the president, his movement has had, especially about George [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=284.88000000000005s)]
*  W. Bush's decision to go into war in Iraq for the Obama and Biden administrations to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=289.44000000000005s)]
*  continue it and for his general belief that the United States shouldn't be doing that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  kind of thing. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  It may be on the verge of doing it now. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=298.88s)]
*  And it is notable that after a few days of several key conservative commentators and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=300.56s)]
*  others in the movement raising questions and lawmakers like Rand Paul saying he shouldn't [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=305.12s)]
*  do it, the vice president is essentially laying out the permission space for the possibility [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=308.8s)]
*  the president takes that step. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKynK2nG0sY&t=313.44s)]
