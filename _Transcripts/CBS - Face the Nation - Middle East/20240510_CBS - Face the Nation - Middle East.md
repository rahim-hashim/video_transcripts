# U.S. report accuses Israel of potentially violating international law
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew)
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken submitted a report to Congress about Israel's conduct [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=0.0s)]
*  in Gaza late Friday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=4.78s)]
*  The findings stop short of concluding that Israel has violated the terms of a U.S. weapons [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=6.54s)]
*  agreement. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=11.14s)]
*  The report was required to be conducted under a national security memorandum issued by the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=12.14s)]
*  president in February. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=16.38s)]
*  I want to bring in now CBS News intelligence and national security reporter Olivia Gazas, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=17.38s)]
*  who's at the State Department for us. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=22.14s)]
*  So Olivia, what more did we learn from this report? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=23.78s)]
*  Sure, Lana. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=26.060000000000002s)]
*  Well, we just got this report. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=27.060000000000002s)]
*  It's a 46-page declassified report moments ago, and it's the result of a joint review [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=28.42s)]
*  led by multiple bureaus within the State Department as well as top diplomats here with input from [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=33.52s)]
*  the Pentagon and the White House. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=38.0s)]
*  Officials also reviewed reports from NGOs, including the UN, media reports and information, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  of course, supplied by the Israeli government. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=46.72s)]
*  The headline is that it does not conclude that Israel is currently in violation of any [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=49.0s)]
*  humanitarian laws, but it is very critical of the government's operations in Gaza and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=55.48s)]
*  says given the volume of U.S. weapons that have been used there and the number of incidents [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  that are currently under review, it is, quote, reasonable to assess that some of those weapons [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=65.02s)]
*  may have been used in manners inconsistent with those laws. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=69.94s)]
*  It also says that the Israeli government initially did not fully cooperate with U.S. efforts [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=73.38s)]
*  to maximize aid flowing into Gaza in the months after October 7th. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=77.97999999999999s)]
*  That picture has since improved, but the U.S. doesn't currently assess Israel to be prohibiting [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=83.28s)]
*  or restricting aid into Gaza. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=88.16s)]
*  It's important to note that this report covers the period from January of 2023 to late April [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=90.68s)]
*  of 2024, so it's not reflective of the most recent developments in Ra'a. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=97.56s)]
*  It is hardly a ringing endorsement of Israel's conduct over the course of the war, but it's [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=102.32s)]
*  also not an assessment that's going to have any material consequences for the continued [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=107.64s)]
*  delivery of U.S. military aid to Israel for the moment. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=111.66s)]
*  So given that, Olivia, what are the early reactions to the report's findings? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=115.46000000000001s)]
*  Is it unexpected at all? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=119.06s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=121.06s)]
*  I mean, this was a long time in coming, and it was slightly delayed. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=122.06s)]
*  And again, we've just gotten this moments ago. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=125.34s)]
*  I think you can expect it will disappoint critics of the Israeli government's comportment [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=127.34s)]
*  in Gaza, and it will just barely assuage its supporters, because it is so critical on so [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=132.8s)]
*  many fronts, while also being inconclusive on virtually all fronts. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=137.58s)]
*  It's also, of course, coming at a critical moment with President Biden just announcing [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=142.08s)]
*  a marked policy shift in suspending one weapon shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel as [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=145.52s)]
*  this looming offensive in Ra'a is still potentially to come, and as negotiators are really very [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=152.94s)]
*  much struggling to keep hostage talks alive. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=158.8s)]
*  We heard today that there's nobody at the table, but they're continuing perhaps on [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  a virtual basis. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=165.26000000000002s)]
*  State Department officials here have told us there are other accountability mechanisms [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=166.94s)]
*  that the U.S. is using in order to make sure that Israel is ultimately held accountable [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=170.66s)]
*  and is found in compliance with international humanitarian law. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=176.61999999999998s)]
*  The problem is that those mechanisms are very slow-moving, and as you've heard from some [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  of the Democratic critics of this administration, they seem to be unequally applied in the case [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=185.73999999999998s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=190.38s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=191.38s)]
*  Olivia Gonz√°lez and the State Department for us. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=192.38s)]
*  Thank you, Olivia. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxLtTMZ-Ew&t=194.01999999999998s)]
