*  holding, and three more hostages [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=3.04s)]
*  were released yesterday, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=4.8s)]

*  First, thank you for having me. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=20.32s)]
*  I've been dreaming about being [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  here today. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=23.88s)]
*  He's doing okay. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=25.52s)]
*  He's lost some weight. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=26.86s)]
*  He's pale, but he's strong, and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=29.34s)]
*  he's doing okay somehow. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=34.72s)]
*  We're incredibly grateful. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=36.92s)]
*  I mean, we've seen the video and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=38.620000000000005s)]
*  the images of him being reunited [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=40.02s)]
*  with family members. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=43.0s)]
*  Will your father, his brother, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=44.4s)]
*  see him soon? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=46.7s)]
*  Yes, he's on his way. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=47.56s)]
*  We've been staggering the family [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=49.2s)]
*  visits so as not to overwhelm [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=51.24s)]
*  him, but, yes, we are all going [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=52.900000000000006s)]
*  to see him, and actually, his [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=55.74s)]
*  youngest daughter, Shear, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=57.28s)]
*  got engaged a month before [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=59.2s)]
*  October 7th, and so the wedding [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=60.660000000000004s)]
*  planning began and then abruptly [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=63.06s)]
*  came to a stop as both of her [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=64.86s)]
*  parents, Keith and my aunt Aviva, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=66.8s)]
*  who was released in the November [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=68.74s)]
*  2023 deal, were taken hostage. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=70.04s)]
*  So what we've talked about is [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=72.88s)]
*  that, you know, someday we're all [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=75.53999999999999s)]
*  going to get together and throw [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=77.58s)]
*  an absolutely epic wedding, and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=79.92s)]
*  that's what we're looking [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=82.36s)]
*  forward to now. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=83.28s)]
*  So you've been an advocate for [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=84.52s)]
*  the family here in Washington, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=86.26s)]
*  both with the Biden and the Trump [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  administrations. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=90.61999999999999s)]
*  In your view, do you think this [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  deal, this hostage release, would [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=93.55999999999999s)]
*  have happened without American [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=95.17999999999999s)]
*  pressure? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  No, definitely not, and I do want [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=97.52s)]
*  to say, so the Biden team, Jake [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=100.55999999999999s)]
*  Sullivan, Brett McGurk, President [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  Biden, Secretary Blinken, Bill [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=103.69999999999999s)]
*  Burns, they were so tireless in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=105.3s)]
*  their commitment to get this deal [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=108.63999999999999s)]
*  done, but the really amazing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=110.3s)]
*  thing is that the minute that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  President Trump was elected, his [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=113.6s)]
*  team started working hand in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  glove with the Biden [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=117.08s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  We felt no break in the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=118.69999999999999s)]
*  commitment to get Keith home. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  Steve Witkoff and Adam Bowler, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=122.44s)]
*  along with President Trump, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=124.0s)]
*  started working hand in hand with [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=125.64s)]
*  the Biden team, and I don't know [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=127.84s)]
*  what other issue you can say that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=129.12s)]
*  about with these administrations. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=130.68s)]
*  The Trump team really did push it [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  over the finish line, and we're [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=134.82s)]
*  incredibly grateful, incredibly [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=137.22s)]
*  grateful to all of them for the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=139.01999999999998s)]
*  work that they did. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=141.5s)]
*  I also just want to say the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=142.3s)]
*  Qatari negotiators, mediators who [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=143.26s)]
*  were part of the November 2023 [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=146.52s)]
*  deal were also instrumental. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=148.26s)]
*  And then what I've learned in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=150.62s)]
*  this completely bizarre [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=152.5s)]
*  experience is that there is a [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=153.96s)]
*  whole industry of people, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=155.36s)]
*  NGOs who work on hostage [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=159.16s)]
*  negotiations on behalf of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=160.96s)]
*  families. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=162.2s)]
*  We worked with Global Reach, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=163.1s)]
*  Mickey Bergman, Stacia George, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=164.9s)]
*  and Eric Lebsen. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=166.24s)]
*  They're a nonprofit. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=168.08s)]
*  We would not have gotten Keith [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=169.64s)]
*  home without them. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=170.78s)]
*  So it was just a tremendous group [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=171.98s)]
*  effort across the board, across [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=174.58s)]
*  political lines, and that's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  heartening. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=178.10000000000002s)]
*  You told us back in April on [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  this program that you were [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=181.34s)]
*  worried, quote, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=182.94s)]
*  it's not arguably in Prime [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=184.62s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu's political [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  interest to close a deal, and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=187.88s)]
*  you were worried he was going to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=189.58s)]
*  sink it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=191.02s)]
*  He's announced phase two of the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  hostage framework begins getting [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=193.9s)]
*  negotiated tomorrow, Monday. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=196.12s)]
*  Do you think he's incentivized [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=199.06s)]
*  now to actually see this deal [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=200.24s)]
*  through? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=201.46s)]
*  I think that the Trump team has [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  done a really tremendous job [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=204.56s)]
*  of putting serious pressure on [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=205.98000000000002s)]
*  him and that that is making a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=207.84s)]
*  difference. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=209.08s)]
*  I think that he, you know, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=210.18s)]
*  we're ecstatic that Keith is [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=211.68s)]
*  home, but it took almost 500 [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=212.72s)]
*  days, and that is in part [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=214.82s)]
*  because of Netanyahu. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=217.16s)]
*  This deal was available [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  for months. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=221.70000000000002s)]
*  The Biden team was working on it, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=222.70000000000002s)]
*  and he wouldn't come to the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=224.70000000000002s)]
*  table often. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=227.46s)]
*  I mean, there are, this is such [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=228.46s)]
*  a complicated issue, but I am [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=230.36s)]
*  worried. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=232.54000000000002s)]
*  I think this is a really fragile [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=233.14000000000001s)]
*  deal, as we all understand. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=234.46s)]
*  And so, you know, I have a lot [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=236.46s)]
*  of faith in the Trump team and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=238.46s)]
*  in all of the people working on [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=240.4s)]
*  this to put serious pressure on [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=242.2s)]
*  him to see it through. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=243.96s)]
*  I think what we've seen is that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=244.96s)]
*  diplomacy and political [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=246.7s)]
*  agreement is the only way to get [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=247.94s)]
*  all of the hostages home. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=249.5s)]
*  And, you know, we're one of the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=250.9s)]
*  lucky ones, but there remain [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=252.94s)]
*  five American citizens and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=255.54s)]
*  dozens of other hostages who [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=257.72s)]
*  still need to come home. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=259.02s)]
*  And the remains of some of those [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugFxeeXKBr8&t=260.12s)]
