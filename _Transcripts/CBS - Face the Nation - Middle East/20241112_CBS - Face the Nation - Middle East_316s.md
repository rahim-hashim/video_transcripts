*  We're defending our people our brave soldiers and pilots and I know that you're working very hard [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=74.64s)]
*  To make sure that this war will end and that will there will be first and foremost security for the people of Israel [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=81.4s)]
*  As well as for the people of Lebanon and in Gaza [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=89.44s)]

*  Clearly you're thinking and working about the day after as well [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=109.88s)]
*  Which perhaps should be a trajectory of hope to the people of the region and the ability to have [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=113.5s)]
*  Our neighbors as well as us live in security and peace [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=121.68s)]
*  But first and foremost we have to get the hostages back angry and it all starts in Tehran [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=125.32s)]
*  It's all starts in the Empire of Evil [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=133.04s)]
*  Where in Tehran [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=136.84s)]

*  Calling for the annihilation of the state of Israel and seeking nuclear weapons [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=145.8s)]
*  Mr. President this has to be a major objective [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=150.72s)]
*  All throughout the your term and the next term of the next president [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=154.24s)]
*  Because we have to make sure that they cannot fulfill their evil [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=158.52s)]
*  Intentions they're also a major engine of anti-semitism [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=163.16s)]
*  Mr. President and I know how much you put a focus on fighting and combating anti-semitism [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=166.84s)]
*  But most importantly I'm here [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  On behalf of the people of Israel and the nation of Israel and the state of Israel to say to you mr. President [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=176.96s)]
*  Thank you very much as we say in Hebrew to the other [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  You've been an incredible friend of Israel and the Jewish people for decades and we will never forget [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  Ever in history how you stood up with us in our darkest hour [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=194.44s)]
*  Which became our finest hour how you came to Israel a few days after the barbaric attack of October 7th [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=199.72s)]
*  How you helped us and supported us with words and deeds and I want to express my heartfelt [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  Thanks to you mr. President [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=214.1s)]
*  Which is a great legacy that you stood up with the Jewish people and the state of Israel as you always did [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=215.76s)]
*  So I brought you a little gift which is an archaeological artifact [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  From the foot of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, which has the word Joseph [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  You're safe. And as you know in the Bible it is says that Joseph [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=233.08s)]
*  Will strengthen Israel and clearly mr. President you've done it. Thank you very much [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=238.0s)]
*  Hope my father heard it. My father was what we call a righteous Christian couldn't understand why we didn't [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=244.16000000000003s)]
*  Back in World War two and less and anyway, I think that was a great legacy of your father [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=251.52s)]
*  Well, it was I remember how I got in trouble [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=257.48s)]
*  We were friends even back then when I said years ago as a senator [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  I said you don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist and I know you are [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  Clearly a Zionist mr. President. Well, God love you. Thank you. Thanks for being here [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=269.36s)]
*  I [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=274.2s)]
*  Think you're buying a meeting there with Israeli president Isaac Herzog at the White House just happened just moments ago [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=277.08s)]
*  President Herzog thanking President Biden for his support of Israel now two big headlines [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=284.4s)]
*  We're kind of watching for in this very historic meeting the first one being an update on the ceasefire talks between [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=289.4s)]
*  Israel and Hamas the other one [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=296.44s)]
*  It's important to know that today marks the White House's deadline for Israel to administer more aid into Gaza and the Biden [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=298.68s)]
*  Administration warned the US would scale back military support if that did not happen [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=306.2s)]
*  So we'll be waiting for more on this historic meeting between those two presidents. We'll be right back [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKpwLSodM4&t=311.2s)]
