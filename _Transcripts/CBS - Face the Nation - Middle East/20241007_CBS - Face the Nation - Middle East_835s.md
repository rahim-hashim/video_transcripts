# Marking 1 year since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c)
*  I'm Chris Lipsay in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=0.0s)]
*  And I'm Errol Barnett here in New York. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Today marks one year since the deadliest massacre in Israel's history, when Hamas launched a [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=11.84s)]
*  surprise attack, killing 1,200 people, taking more than 250 hostage. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=18.68s)]
*  And 100 of those hostages remain in Hamas captivity right now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=24.96s)]
*  And their families aren't backing down. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  They continue to demand their loved ones be released. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=32.04s)]
*  And around the world, this Samba day is being marked with many memorial events, as well [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=35.3s)]
*  as pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protests and rallies. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=40.22s)]
*  We have a special show for you today as we cover events in Israel and all around the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=44.94s)]
*  the world, remembering the lives lost and those taken hostage on October 7th and marking [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=50.36s)]
*  the start of the Israel-Hamas war. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=54.96s)]
*  I want to send it back to our Chris Lipsay in Yarkon Park in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=57.6s)]
*  It's a sobering day, Chris. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=62.2s)]
*  That's right, Errol. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=65.32s)]
*  As you said, I'm here in Yarkon Park in Tel Aviv where we're remembering that horrific [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=66.32s)]
*  day one year ago. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  You can see this massive stage they've set up behind me. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=72.16s)]
*  And you can also hear some of the sound tests that they're performing getting ready for [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=74.84s)]
*  a big event they're going to have later on today where we're going to hear from some [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=78.88000000000001s)]
*  survivors. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=82.92s)]
*  We're going to hear from family members. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=83.92s)]
*  We're going to hear from victims of those who were killed on that day. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=85.84s)]
*  You might be able to make out some of the vehicles behind me on the stage as well. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=90.44s)]
*  Those were recovered from the Nova Music Festival where hundreds of people were gunned down [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=93.76s)]
*  by Hamas gunmen. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=99.44s)]
*  Now, something very poignant to point out about this event where I am right now is that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=101.0s)]
*  it was organized by the families and not by the government. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=105.96s)]
*  And that was very, very specific. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=109.88s)]
*  The families and volunteers wanted to draw a distinction between the government that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=112.24s)]
*  many of them blame for allowing the events, those horrific events of October 7 to have [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=117.44s)]
*  happened in the first place. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=122.56s)]
*  Remember, this was on the watch of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and they blame him for [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  this massive, this historic security breach, this intelligence breach. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  By their lights, a massive leadership breach as well. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=135.08s)]
*  But we start with a look back at that fateful morning on October 7 and the terrible events [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=139.4s)]
*  that unfolded in its wake. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=144.24s)]
*  Our Elizabeth Palmer reports. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=146.08s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=148.72s)]
*  This is Kibbutz Berri, about three miles from Gaza. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=149.96s)]
*  And reminders of the massacre are everywhere, like the burned out house you can see behind [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=153.84s)]
*  me. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=158.68s)]
*  This is where Hamas murdered Yuval Haran's father and kidnapped his mother and six other [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=159.84s)]
*  members of the family. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=164.72s)]
*  It's just one of the traumatic stories that Israelis are reliving today, a year after [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=167.24s)]
*  the October 7 attack. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=172.96s)]
*  The attack began with Hamas terrorists shooting their way out of Gaza, past Israeli border [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=178.28s)]
*  security, to launch a pitiless attack on young people attending a music festival. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=184.32s)]
*  It was chaos, a killing spree and mass kidnapping there and on nearby Kibbutz where 101 people [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=190.6s)]
*  were murdered, some burned alive in their homes and even babies abducted. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  Israel's response was immediate. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=207.04s)]
*  It bombed Gaza. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=210.24s)]
*  The bomb was then sent in ground forces. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=213.12s)]
*  The mission? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=215.4s)]
*  To destroy Hamas and rescue the hostages. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=216.4s)]
*  A year later, neither has been accomplished. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  97 hostages taken on October 7 are presumed still to be in Gaza, along with two million [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  Palestinians trapped in a sliver of land the Israeli military bombs every day. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  The target, they say, is Hamas. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=238.12s)]
*  The collateral damage can be anyone else, no matter how small. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=241.92s)]
*  As for the physical destruction, on a recent visit to southern Gaza with the military, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=247.64s)]
*  we saw nothing but ruins. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  Recent polling data shows a slim majority of Israelis want the war in Gaza to end in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  a deal to bring the hostages home. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=261.68s)]
*  Easier said than done. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=264.44s)]
*  Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, in hiding, is stalling on a deal and vowing to fight on. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=266.48s)]
*  We will win. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=273.6s)]
*  And millions of Israelis believe Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his ultra-right allies [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=276.52s)]
*  are stalling too. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=282.02s)]
*  We say that our government are full of s**t, excuse my language, and they do nothing. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=284.02s)]
*  Our prime minister is a liar. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=291.12s)]
*  Over the past month, Israel's government has led the country into a bigger, riskier war. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=294.1s)]
*  Most of the hostages' families fear that could mean a death sentence for their loved ones. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=301.86s)]
*  As one speaker said at a memorial we attended this morning, we all know this war has to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=307.64s)]
*  end in a deal. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=312.82s)]
*  It's just a question of how many lives will be lost in the meantime. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=313.82s)]
*  Elizabeth Palmer, CBS News, Kibbutz Berry, Israel. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=318.78s)]
*  Elizabeth Palmer there with a retrospective one year on. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=323.22s)]
*  Hamas took more than 250 people captive on October 7th. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=326.94000000000005s)]
*  Nearly half have since been released or rescued. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=330.46000000000004s)]
*  Again, Liz Palmer with the harrowing story of one woman who survived more than seven [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=333.34000000000003s)]
*  weeks in Hamas captivity. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=338.42s)]
*  You're sitting there as dawn breaks. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=341.14000000000004s)]
*  What was the first concrete sign that something was terribly wrong? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=344.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, 6 a.m. was one beautiful sunrise. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=349.74s)]
*  One very peaceful moment that everybody remembers. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=355.3s)]
*  Everybody speaks about that moment. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  And then 29 minutes later, two rockets in the sky. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=361.90000000000003s)]
*  Eventually after hearing gunshots above my head and seeing them touching ground already, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=366.34000000000003s)]
*  and that put me in a point that, okay, something is happening. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=373.54s)]
*  And after five hours, five hours of running, they found us happy, cheering, screaming [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=379.41999999999996s)]
*  al-Awakbar. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=389.34s)]
*  And what did he do? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=390.34s)]
*  He was standing with an iron pipe above my head about to beat me. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=392.26s)]
*  I pretended to be an Arab, and I was using my five, six words in Arabic. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=396.5s)]
*  And did that stop him? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=402.46s)]
*  I was using tons of manipulation. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=403.74s)]
*  I was pretending to be fainting and seeming weak. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=405.58s)]
*  I can't do anything against you. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=410.65999999999997s)]
*  I'll give you whatever you want, whatever I have on me, but please don't kill me. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=412.9s)]
*  And then they took a video of me and posted it on TikTok. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=419.18s)]
*  Of you on the ground basically begging for your life. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=423.18s)]
*  And they posted it on TikTok. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=426.46s)]
*  And that's how my parents found out that I was kidnapped. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=429.46s)]
*  Later this hour, we'll have more from Elizabeth Palmer and that hostage who came home. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=433.38s)]
*  Hamas still holds about 100 hostages, including four Americans. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=438.14s)]
*  About half the hostages are believed to be dead, like Idan Stivi. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=442.85999999999996s)]
*  Hamas announced this morning he was killed at the Nova Festival, and they're still holding [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=447.17999999999995s)]
*  his body. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=451.38s)]
*  For most of the past year, Israelis have taken to the streets to pressure Prime Minister [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=452.58s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu to secure a deal with Hamas to release them. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=456.53999999999996s)]
*  I spoke to protesters at a demonstration this weekend. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=460.78000000000003s)]
*  For most of the past year, thousands and thousands of people have been turning out here to protest [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=465.98s)]
*  for the release of the hostages. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=471.86s)]
*  Of the 250 that were originally taken on October 7, more than 100 still remain in Hamas' captivity. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=474.06s)]
*  Some are dead, some are alive. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=482.7s)]
*  We don't know exactly how many. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=484.38s)]
*  The people out here, most of them blame the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=486.38s)]
*  for not doing enough to bring them home, but also, of course, the terrorist organization [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=491.26s)]
*  Hamas for taking them hostage to begin with. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=496.58s)]
*  This is actually a small gathering compared to the ones we've seen in recent months, where [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=500.06s)]
*  there were hundreds of thousands of people coming out. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=504.74s)]
*  However, there have been recent government restrictions on group gatherings because of [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=507.34s)]
*  the Iranian missiles that have been launched at Israel in the past week, not to mention [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=512.5400000000001s)]
*  the new front that's opened up in the war with Lebanon. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=517.26s)]
*  So people are coming out right now as much as they can, not knowing if they're going [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=520.5400000000001s)]
*  to come out again to celebrate the memorial itself. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=525.1s)]
*  You can see there's really all walks of life here, men, women, children, young, old, rich, poor. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=528.02s)]
*  The one thing that draws them all together is that shared sense of anguish they feel [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=533.74s)]
*  for the hostages who are still being held in Hamas' captivity. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=538.26s)]
*  In fact, they tell me that for them, October 7th never ended. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=541.26s)]
*  And what brings you out here tonight? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=545.62s)]
*  I actually come here like, I don't know, three times a week, maybe four. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=547.1s)]
*  There's no other way. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=555.26s)]
*  We've got to be here for the families, for the hostages, for Israel. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=556.26s)]
*  This is my country, my people. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=561.1s)]
*  It could have been my dad or my daughter, you know. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=564.18s)]
*  So I got to, you got to come here. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=566.9399999999999s)]
*  You got to be here every night or, you know, whatever you can. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=570.46s)]
*  I'm the son of the Jehovah's leaf sheets and the dead leaf sheets. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=574.02s)]
*  My mother released after 17 days and my father is still in Gaza. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=577.7800000000001s)]
*  Did you ever imagine you would still be here a year later? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=583.22s)]
*  No, but yes and no. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=586.74s)]
*  Both sides perhaps don't want this deal. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=589.86s)]
*  You've been doing this for a year. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=592.1s)]
*  I mean, does that ever feel hopeless? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=593.38s)]
*  You know, it's very, very difficult to make it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=595.94s)]
*  When you get your family back? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=600.74s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=602.34s)]
*  Do you think that you'll be able to recover from this horrific, horrific event? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=603.74s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=610.7800000000001s)]
*  I will always remember what happened over here on the 7th of October. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=611.7800000000001s)]
*  Now some posters you saw at that rally showed a man named Or Levy who was taken hostage [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=616.1s)]
*  during the Nova Music Festival where Hamas gunned down hundreds of people. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=621.0200000000001s)]
*  I sat down with his brother, Michael Levy, and I asked him how his family is coping one year on. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=625.4599999999999s)]
*  And a warning, some viewers may find this report distressing. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=631.2199999999999s)]
*  My mom called me crying. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=634.74s)]
*  She said that she spoke to all and he just repeated a sentence, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=637.74s)]
*  Mom, you don't want to know what's going on here. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=641.62s)]
*  Apparently it was inside a bomb shelter. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=643.86s)]
*  They ran into it because of the missile attack. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=647.9799999999999s)]
*  And even then I wasn't too worried because in my mind it was just a missile attack. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=652.66s)]
*  So they ran into the shelter for safety. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=659.5799999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=661.6999999999999s)]
*  And apparently this shelter became a death trap. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=662.6999999999999s)]
*  A death trap. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=667.42s)]
*  A few minutes after that call, a group of terrorists arrived. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=670.86s)]
*  They sprayed it with bullets. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=675.38s)]
*  They threw grenades inside. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=677.14s)]
*  They even fired an RPG into it. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=678.78s)]
*  What happened to his wife? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=682.02s)]
*  He was killed from one of the grenades that exploded inside. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=683.62s)]
*  His wife was killed? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=689.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=690.9s)]
*  And they have a son? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=691.9s)]
*  They have a son, Almog. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=693.9s)]
*  He just turned three last June. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=696.1s)]
*  We tried to throw him a birthday to make him feel like a normal kid. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=701.22s)]
*  He was happy. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=709.22s)]
*  But for me, for us, it was the saddest birthday I've ever been to. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=711.46s)]
*  Just looking at him and knowing that he won't see his mother anymore. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=718.14s)]
*  Celebrating a birthday with no parents. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=724.34s)]
*  That's something that no kid in the world should suffer. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=727.94s)]
*  On the second day, on October 9th, I promised my parents I'll bring him back. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=731.98s)]
*  I don't know why and how I got the nerve to promise such a thing. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=737.9399999999999s)]
*  Honestly, I still don't know how I'm going to do it. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=742.78s)]
*  But I promised them and then I promised myself and I promised Almog I'll bring his father back. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=746.78s)]
*  And I intend to keep that promise. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=752.78s)]
*  And this is why I wake up every morning and keep going. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=756.3399999999999s)]
*  Did you ever imagine you'd be here a year later? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=761.3399999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=765.78s)]
*  How did October 7th change Israel? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=767.78s)]
*  I think the best example is something that my seven-year-old daughter said a month ago to my wife. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=770.78s)]
*  She asked her if she hears a siren or if she sees a missile attack. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=781.78s)]
*  She won't get into a safe room. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=790.78s)]
*  She won't get into a car. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=794.78s)]
*  She asked her to promise her to keep running. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=796.78s)]
*  To run away from it. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=800.78s)]
*  I think it describes what we all feel. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=803.78s)]
*  We do not feel safe in our own country. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=806.78s)]
*  I want my girls to live in peace and grow up in peace. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=810.78s)]
*  That's the dream. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=814.78s)]
*  I believe it can happen, but we'll have to work hard to get it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=818.78s)]
*  Michael Levy also told me that in order for his entire country just to begin the healing process, all of the hostages need to come home. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3qzCbMC0c&t=823.78s)]
