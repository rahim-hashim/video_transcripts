# Israel begins attack against Iran
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI)
*  This is a CBS News special report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm John Dickerson in New York. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=2.6s)]
*  We're coming on the air with breaking news. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=4.2s)]
*  Israel has just launched airstrikes into Iran. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=6.0s)]
*  The Israeli defense minister is saying in a statement that they are, quote, preemptive [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=9.36s)]
*  strikes. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=15.0s)]
*  The strikes come ahead of a six-round of talks on Sunday between the U.S. and Iran. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=16.0s)]
*  Yesterday Iran threatened to target U.S. military bases in the region if conflict broke out, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=20.44s)]
*  prompting the State Department to order non-emergency government officials to exit Iraq due to heightened [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=25.92s)]
*  regional tensions. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=31.8s)]
*  The Pentagon has also authorized military family members to voluntarily leave locations [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  throughout the Middle East. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=38.980000000000004s)]
*  Let's bring in now Face the Nation moderator and chief foreign affairs correspondent for [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  CBS, Margaret Brennan. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  Margaret, let's just start with the basic question. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=45.6s)]
*  Why is Israel moving at this moment to do this? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=47.96s)]
*  We don't know why Israel chose this moment in time, but we know the Israeli prime minister [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=52.2s)]
*  has been pressing to take military action and wanting the United States to support it, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=57.28s)]
*  either directly or at least not yet in the way. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=63.24s)]
*  What we know is that this week the IAEA, which is the UN nuclear watchdog, voted after reviewing [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=67.28s)]
*  reports showing that Iran had not been truthful about past military activity, that it had [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=77.72s)]
*  been violating diplomatic agreements, it had to restrict what it was doing, and most significantly [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=83.4s)]
*  had acquired a stockpile of a sizable amount of enriched nuclear fuel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=89.88s)]
*  They do not have a weapons program, according to U.S. intelligence, but both the United [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=95.28s)]
*  States and many European partners said the amount of fuel they had was at such a level [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=101.72s)]
*  and enriched at such a high quantity that that triggered deep concern that they could [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=108.12s)]
*  quickly, if they made the political decision, seek to make a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=113.0s)]
*  At this point, U.S. intelligence still does not believe they have a weaponization program [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=117.8s)]
*  to actually launch a nuclear weapon, but Israel has been troubled by the activity and at this [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=122.4s)]
*  moment in time the Israeli prime minister has been arguing Israel is in a weakened state [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=129.88s)]
*  because of the past attacks last year by Israel on Tehran's defenses, its aerial systems, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=135.24s)]
*  also because of the damage to their militias with that multi-front war against Hezbollah [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=142.28s)]
*  and Hamas. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=146.88s)]
*  So, this is a moment of opportunity for the prime minister. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=147.88s)]
*  As you pointed out, John, there is still a plan, at least at this point, for the top [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=150.72s)]
*  Iranian diplomat to meet with President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, who has been trying [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=156.8s)]
*  to urge Iran to take a deal to restrict its program. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  That is still scheduled for Sunday in Oman. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=165.84s)]
*  You can imagine that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=169.0s)]
*  Well, I won't speculate. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=170.0s)]
*  Tell us, help us understand, Margaret, how much of a challenge this is for U.S. policymakers. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=172.0s)]
*  You've sketched why the Israelis think there's a moment of opportunity here. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=176.84s)]
*  What are you hearing from your sources in the U.S. government? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, John, I'll be very transparent with you and our viewers. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=184.76s)]
*  U.S. officials weren't entirely clear on what was going to happen and when. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=188.32s)]
*  It was very tight hold. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=193.72s)]
*  And we know even at this moment, we're all trying to figure out exactly what the targets [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=195.12s)]
*  are that Israel is going after. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  Did they see, for example, movement of material? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=201.32s)]
*  Was there a reason this window was so specific as to why they would need to take advantage [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  of it? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=211.0s)]
*  What U.S. officials are looking at is the concern, of course, about immediate blowback [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  for U.S. personnel and staff in the region and diplomats. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=218.0s)]
*  Remember yesterday, the Pentagon advised the family members, the dependents of military [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=221.32s)]
*  officers in the region to leave if they wanted to. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=228.76s)]
*  We know the State Department drew down significantly from the U.S. mission in Iraq. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  Iraq borders Iran. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=237.48s)]
*  There are significant militia presence within Iraq. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=238.92s)]
*  And so there is concern that for the thousands of U.S. troops that remain stationed in Iraq [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=242.6s)]
*  and in nearby Syria, that there could be some risk there. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=248.56s)]
*  So there are Americans on these front lines. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=252.2s)]
*  There's always the concern of a regional spillover. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=254.28s)]
*  And then from some of our allies, there's also concern that if Israel targets and hits [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=256.92s)]
*  sites where there was nuclear enrichment, nuclear development, that there is also an [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  from an explosion there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=268.0s)]
*  So we need to really understand the details of what was targeted. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=269.24s)]
*  Were these missiles? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=272.76000000000005s)]
*  Were these nuclear program sites exactly what? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=274.16s)]
*  We're waiting on the Israeli Defense Force to brief on those details. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=277.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=280.68s)]
*  Stand by for a second, Margaret. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=281.68s)]
*  We have more from the Israeli Defense Minister. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=282.68s)]
*  And I'm reading now, following the state of Israel's preemptive strike against Iran, a [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=284.56s)]
*  missile and drone attack against the state of Israel and its civilian population is expected [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=288.76s)]
*  in the immediate future. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  That senior White House correspondent, Weijia Zhang, joins us now. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  Weijia, what do you got? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  What are they saying at the White House? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=300.32s)]
*  John, so far at this hour, they are saying nothing. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=302.04s)]
*  But we do know that President Trump was hosting a congressional picnic here. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=305.68s)]
*  We can still hear the sound from that on the South Lawn as lawmakers gather. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=309.8s)]
*  And just around 8 o'clock, half an hour ago, he went to the West Wing. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=314.16s)]
*  We know that because there is a military standing guard sentry outside of the West Wing entrance. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=318.76s)]
*  And as you know, that means the president is now inside working. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=325.08000000000004s)]
*  And so we are trying to figure out, John, whether he got a heads up before this happened [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  and what sort of intelligence he received from the Israelis, if any, before this attack. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=336.56s)]
*  Now, the president spoke at length about this earlier today, John, and he was explicitly [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=343.16s)]
*  asked how imminent is an Israeli attack on Iran. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=348.44s)]
*  And he said he did not want to use that word, but added that it looks like something could [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=353.0s)]
*  very well happen. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  He was also asked if the Israelis had shared any direct information with him. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=359.44s)]
*  And he said no, but it's interesting because he also said it could be a dangerous situation. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=364.47999999999996s)]
*  Obviously, actions speak louder than words as Margaret laid out the administration urged [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=370.88s)]
*  American personnel in the region to evacuate. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  So at this hour, we do not know how much the president knows about the attack, whether [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=380.56s)]
*  he was briefed earlier. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=386.32s)]
*  But John, even today, knowing whatever it is he obviously did know to make the assessment [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=388.32s)]
*  that the situation there could escalate quickly, he still expressed optimism that a deal with [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=393.32s)]
*  Iran could still happen. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=400.4s)]
*  And so, you know, the question that remains unanswered, John, is whether he has now changed [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=403.12s)]
*  his red line in order to get that deal across the finish line. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=409.6s)]
*  Just weeks ago, he made very clear himself, along with officials, that the red line in [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=414.12s)]
*  order to have a successful agreement was that Iran would not be enriching any amounts of [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  uranium, zero levels of enrichment. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=427.24s)]
*  And that is something that Tehran publicly was not agreeing to. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=430.84000000000003s)]
*  And so today, while the president said Iran could never have a nuclear weapon, that would [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=435.48s)]
*  require very high levels of enrichment. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=441.24s)]
*  He did not answer whether they were still open to lower levels. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=443.72s)]
*  And that is going to be critical, John, moving forward in assessing how realistic a deal [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=447.64000000000004s)]
*  is, especially as we monitor the situation in Iran and how Tehran decides to respond. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=452.6s)]
*  Weijia Zhang at the White House, thank you so much. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=460.96000000000004s)]
*  Weijia with us now is retired U.S. Marine Corps General Kenneth McKenzie, former head [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=463.44s)]
*  of U.S. Central Command and current CBS News contributor. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=468.04s)]
*  General, what's the first thing you're going to want to look for or first questions you [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=471.32s)]
*  would want answered after you learn about this attack? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=475.2s)]
*  Well, I think we begin by seeing that the Israelis probably achieved tactical surprise. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=478.32s)]
*  There have been no reports of Israeli aircraft downed. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=483.64s)]
*  I'm guessing this is a combination of manned, low-observable aircraft, stealth aircraft, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=486.24s)]
*  some long-range missiles, some short-range missiles, possibly some drones launched from [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=492.32s)]
*  within Iran. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=495.28s)]
*  A complex attack looks like against the nuclear sites, but as you said, that would be the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=496.28s)]
*  first thing I'd like to know if I were looking at this right now. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=502.24s)]
*  Is it a narrow attack? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=505.64s)]
*  Was it simply against the nuclear sites? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=506.92s)]
*  Because then you may have an opportunity to scope and scale a potential Iranian response. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  And on the note of an Iranian response, Iran will not be able to respond immediately. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=513.52s)]
*  It will take them a little while to bring their missiles to readiness. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=518.52s)]
*  They're probably not ready to do that right now. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=522.68s)]
*  Sun's going to be coming up in a little while. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  They will probably not want to do something during daylight. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=526.96s)]
*  So we're looking at the next period of darkness at the very earliest time for a probable Iranian [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=529.24s)]
*  response. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=535.92s)]
*  And as you know, John, those responses have not been particularly effective against Israel [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=536.92s)]
*  the last two times they've done that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=539.92s)]
*  Well, I wanted to ask you about that. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  Since it was your daily concern, what's your assessment of how weakened Iran is? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=543.12s)]
*  And two questions. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=549.08s)]
*  One, because their proxies are weakened. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=550.08s)]
*  But then also, we've had more evidence about their ability to respond, to make an evaluation [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=552.42s)]
*  of whether they can in fact respond as wide and as deep as we once thought. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=556.44s)]
*  Iran misses Lebanese Hezbollah. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=563.44s)]
*  That was their huge strategic hedge against Israel. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=565.24s)]
*  Lebanese Hezbollah is out of the fight. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=567.84s)]
*  The Syrians are out of the fight. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=569.72s)]
*  Iran is generationally weakened right now. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=571.72s)]
*  Now that's against Israel. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=574.8000000000001s)]
*  They still have a lot of weapons that they could fire against our bases in the region [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  and against countries such as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates, where they would [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=581.0400000000001s)]
*  be able to generate more missiles than they can actually fire at Israel. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=585.5400000000001s)]
*  So that would be an option. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  But that would be a marked widening of the war and probably lead to direct pressure on [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=590.96s)]
*  the Iranian regime. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=595.88s)]
*  The ultimate goal of Iranian statecraft is regime survival. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=597.48s)]
*  And they will make their calculation about the next move with that held as the highest [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=601.32s)]
*  objective. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=605.48s)]
*  So it will be real interesting to watch what the Iranians do here over the next 24 to 48 [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=606.48s)]
*  hours. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=610.6800000000001s)]
*  And General, just to bring our viewers up to speed here, that we are watching Iranian [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=611.6800000000001s)]
*  television there. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=615.4000000000001s)]
*  Those are pictures of Iran at night. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=616.72s)]
*  You see some smoke there. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=620.36s)]
*  And then we also have some reporting. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=622.6400000000001s)]
*  Our Jennifer Jacobs reports that the White House will convene a cabinet meeting tomorrow [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=624.08s)]
*  morning. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=627.44s)]
*  That's per several sources. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=628.44s)]
*  The U.S. is not a part of this operation. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=629.5600000000001s)]
*  There is no intelligence sharing. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=632.2800000000001s)]
*  Iran State TV says the country's air defense system is on full alert. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=634.2800000000001s)]
*  General, if you're still with us, I just have one other question. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=638.8800000000001s)]
*  In terms of the ladder of Israeli attacks, you mentioned that there might be a smaller [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=644.2s)]
*  scale attack and then just kind of make a new kind of assessment. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  How much could Israel do without help of the United States in terms of hurting the country [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=653.12s)]
*  and the Iranian nuclear program? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=660.36s)]
*  John, they can damage the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=662.36s)]
*  They can give it significant damage. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=664.76s)]
*  They cannot do the things that we could do to the Iranian nuclear program because they [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=666.64s)]
*  don't have the special ordinance that will let you go deep into the deep underground [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=670.6s)]
*  spaces where the Iranians have some of the most sensitive parts of their program concealed. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=674.16s)]
*  So that is going to be a limit, but they can still do a significant amount of damage. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=679.4399999999999s)]
*  And again, I don't know if they plan to come back tomorrow night. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=683.84s)]
*  Is this a one night event? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=687.3199999999999s)]
*  Is it going to be a multi-day event? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=688.66s)]
*  That's still to be discovered. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=692.42s)]
*  The Israelis will certainly assess the damage. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=693.8199999999999s)]
*  They'll look at how it went and then they'll make decisions based on that. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=695.9399999999999s)]
*  And they'll also make decisions, I'm sure, based on whatever the Iranian response is. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=699.14s)]
*  And again, I would just emphasize the narrower the Israeli strike, the more clearly confined [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=704.02s)]
*  to the nuclear target that it is. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=708.78s)]
*  And the nuclear target is a bunch of targets. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=710.6999999999999s)]
*  I want to be clear, as you sort of illustrated in your very good graphic, it's a lot of targets. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=712.26s)]
*  But as long as they're narrowly scaled against that, there's a possibility we might be able [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=716.68s)]
*  to control escalation here. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=721.68s)]
*  And General, what are U.S. military officials thinking right now in terms of their assets [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=723.4799999999999s)]
*  in the region that are possibly in danger? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=730.3399999999999s)]
*  Give me a sense of the to-do list that suddenly has popped up in front of U.S. decision makers. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=733.3599999999999s)]
*  So everybody's at a very high state of alert right now. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=738.3599999999999s)]
*  Probably a lot of people are in shelters. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=741.0s)]
*  We're looking very hard at all our sensors to see what the Iranians might do next. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=743.48s)]
*  I would think the CENTCOM commander's probably taken steps to disperse his aircraft, to position [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=748.82s)]
*  ships in different places than where they've just been, to do a variety of things, all [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=754.4200000000001s)]
*  of which will complicate Iranian targeting as they begin to decide what their next move [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=758.24s)]
*  is going to be. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=762.8000000000001s)]
*  And I would also think that there will probably be some clear and unambiguous messaging directed [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=763.8000000000001s)]
*  at Iran warning them of the ultimate consequences of attacking U.S. forces and U.S. targets [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=768.0s)]
*  in the region. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=773.06s)]
*  Because I have to believe, John, if that occurs, the Iranian regime itself will come under [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=774.06s)]
*  pressure. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=778.14s)]
*  And I go back to a point I made earlier. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=779.14s)]
*  Preservation of that regime remains the highest goal of Iranian statecraft. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=781.5799999999999s)]
*  And just holding on that point for a second, it remains the highest goal. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=786.7399999999999s)]
*  So does that mean they're limited really in how far they're really going to go because [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=790.1999999999999s)]
*  they don't want to get a massive attack that might bring that into question? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=794.78s)]
*  In their own worldview, the Iranians are realists. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=800.9s)]
*  They know the limits of their capabilities. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=804.6999999999999s)]
*  They've been badly exposed by the attacks of their offensive forces on Israel. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=806.5799999999999s)]
*  Their own defensive forces have been severely attrited by prior Israeli attacks. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=811.14s)]
*  They're at the weakest they've been in many, many years. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=815.78s)]
*  When pressed, the Iranians are willing to negotiate. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=818.54s)]
*  They did this during the Iran-Iraq War. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=822.4599999999999s)]
*  It's called drinking from the poison chalice in Iranian statecraft. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=824.4599999999999s)]
*  They've done it before. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=829.06s)]
*  It's possible they'll do it again. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=830.9s)]
*  I think it all depends on the nature of this attack, how successful it was, what the collateral [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=832.26s)]
*  damage is. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=836.9s)]
*  There are a variety of factors that will go into that calculation. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=837.9s)]
*  All right, General McKenzie, thank you. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=839.78s)]
*  I want to turn to Margaret Brennan. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=841.66s)]
*  Margaret, remind us again of sort of the nature of the deal that was on the table between [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=843.78s)]
*  the United States and the Iranians or what the terms were they were at least negotiating [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=848.8599999999999s)]
*  over. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=854.2199999999999s)]
*  So about two weeks ago, Steve Witkoff, President Trump's envoy, his friend, the real estate [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=855.26s)]
*  developer who has been the person he's put at the tip of the spear with all really highly [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=860.66s)]
*  sensitive diplomacy, transmitted a proposal via OMON, that small Gulf emirate that tries [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=866.38s)]
*  to communicate with both the West and with Iran, whose regime is really diplomatically [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=873.58s)]
*  isolated. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=879.38s)]
*  And in that proposal, the United States floated a number of different ideas. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=880.38s)]
*  Permutations of what a potential negotiated agreement with the United States could look [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=885.06s)]
*  like. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=890.6999999999999s)]
*  But what was clear within those options sets was that the United States does not want Iran [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=891.6999999999999s)]
*  to be able to enrich uranium, nuclear fuel, on its own territory, even if it were just [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=898.5s)]
*  at low levels of enrichment for what Iran was claiming always was a civilian nuclear [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=905.6999999999999s)]
*  program. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=910.9399999999999s)]
*  The United States was offering, okay, we'll let you have a nuclear program that is peaceful [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=912.54s)]
*  and for power purposes, a civilian one, but you'd have to go buy that enriched fuel outside [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=917.06s)]
*  of your own borders. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=922.78s)]
*  We don't want you to have that option. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=923.9399999999999s)]
*  That's where Iran was really insistent that they had the right to this. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=926.54s)]
*  The U.S. offered and actually reached out, as President Trump did in his conversation [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=930.14s)]
*  with Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, to see if other states that have close relationships [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=934.26s)]
*  with Iran, as Russia does, would help with that. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=940.62s)]
*  Russia even possibly taking some of that enriched nuclear fuel we talked about that was enriched [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=943.86s)]
*  up to that 60% level. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=949.6600000000001s)]
*  90% is weapons grade, so you can see how close that was and why it was making U.S. officials [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=951.7s)]
*  and other officials around the world nervous and said you could ship that to Russia. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=958.22s)]
*  By the way, that's what President Obama did in that 2015 diplomatic deal. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=963.7s)]
*  There are some ideas in this proposal that look very similar to that same diplomatic [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=968.9s)]
*  accord that President Trump exited back in 2018. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=973.82s)]
*  Remember, until 2018, Iran had agreed to limit its program. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=976.86s)]
*  It was only after the U.S. pulled out that they began this enrichment cycle again, and [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=980.86s)]
*  that is what has triggered this renewed concern. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeDfHB_IUI&t=984.94s)]
