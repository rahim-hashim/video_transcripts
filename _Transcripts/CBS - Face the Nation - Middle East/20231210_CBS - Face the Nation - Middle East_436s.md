Video Description: Sen. Bernie Sanders tells "Face the Nation" that "Israel is losing the war in terms of how the world is looking at the situation" in the Middle East.

# "Israel is losing the war" of worldwide public opinion, Sen. Bernie Sanders says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [December 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ)
*  We turn now to Independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who joins us this morning from Burlington, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Vermont. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=6.2s)]
*  Good morning to you, Senator. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=7.2s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  I think we've got your audio now, sir. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that he sees a gap between Israel's stated intent [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=15.0s)]
*  of limiting civilian casualties and reality. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=21.2s)]
*  And the Secretary of Defense said they could face a strategic defeat given civilian casualties. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=23.84s)]
*  Is this vocal enough criticism from the administration in your point of view? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=31.32s)]
*  Well, it's a start. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=37.24s)]
*  I think both Blinken and Austin are right. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=38.84s)]
*  What the president is trying to do is trying to make clear to Netanyahu and his right-wing [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  government is, yes, you can go to war against Hamas, but you cannot go to war against the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=48.84s)]
*  Palestinian people and cause the horrific damage to human life that we are seeing right [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=56.2s)]
*  now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  Margaret, there have been 16,000 people killed so far, Palestinians, two-thirds of whom are [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=64.4s)]
*  women and children. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  We're talking about 1.9 million people displaced, going around without any water, food, without [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=73.4s)]
*  any medical supplies. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  It is a humanitarian disaster, and the United States has got to put all of the pressure [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  that it can to tell Netanyahu to stop this disastrous military approach. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  And just to be clear, Israel says it's killed 7,000 militants. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=92.44s)]
*  They haven't explained how many civilians they estimate they've killed. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=95.72s)]
*  The U.S. says they can't tally it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=98.64000000000001s)]
*  The number you cited there is from the Gaza Ministry of Health. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=102.52s)]
*  But the bottom line here is I know you have been very clear to your colleagues the U.S. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=105.44s)]
*  should not provide more aid to Israel, to the Netanyahu government, with no strings [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=109.72s)]
*  attached, you wrote, because it would make the U.S. complicit, you said, quote, in an [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  all-out war against innocent men, women, and children who have nothing to do with Hamas. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=120.86s)]
*  What do you believe the Netanyahu government's intent is here? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=127.68s)]
*  Hard to say. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=132.36s)]
*  It really is hard to say. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=135.24s)]
*  It may be that they're responding in rage against the horrific and terrible Hamas attack [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=136.72s)]
*  that killed 1,200 innocent Israelis. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=144.32s)]
*  Maybe in some of the right-wing extremist minds, there is the goal to drive the Palestinian [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=147.96s)]
*  people off of Gaza completely. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=153.84s)]
*  They have now destroyed about half of the housing units in Gaza, so it's hard to predict. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=157.12s)]
*  But I think when General Austin said you can win the battle but lose the war, Israel is [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=161.96s)]
*  losing the war in terms of how the world is looking at this situation. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  And I think that it would be irresponsible to the United States to give Netanyahu another [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=174.28s)]
*  $10 billion to continue to wage this awful war. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=179.88000000000002s)]
*  So progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib have been clear in calling for [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=185.48s)]
*  a ceasefire. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=190.96s)]
*  You've taken some flak because you have not. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=192.72s)]
*  The United States government is opposing a ceasefire as well, and they're isolated at [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  the U.N. on that point. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=201.28s)]
*  Why is it you oppose a ceasefire? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=202.96s)]
*  Well, first of all, I strongly support and wish and hope that the United States will [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=204.84s)]
*  the United Nations resolution that was vetoed, that we vetoed the other day. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=212.6s)]
*  That was a humanitarian cause, a humanitarian ceasefire that would have, by the way, called [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=217.92s)]
*  for the release of all of the hostages held by Hamas and would have allowed the U.N. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=224.0s)]
*  and other agencies to begin to supply the enormous amount of humanitarian aid that the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=229.32s)]
*  Palestinian people need. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=234.76s)]
*  In terms of a permanent ceasefire, I don't know how you could have a permanent ceasefire [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=236.27999999999997s)]
*  with Hamas, who had said before October 7th and after October 7th that they want to destroy [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=241.52s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=248.52s)]
*  They want a permanent war. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=249.52s)]
*  I don't know how you have a permanent ceasefire with an attitude like that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=251.24s)]
*  OK, so the war you're saying against Hamas is justified in that way. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=256.2s)]
*  I think Israel has the right to defend itself and to go after us, not the Palestinian people. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=262.76s)]
*  OK, would you vote against a version of the supplemental bill that President Biden is [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=269.56s)]
*  asking Congress for if it lacked the conditions on Israel aid you're calling for? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=274.8s)]
*  Because you know there's other things that may be attached to, like Ukraine aid. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=280.92s)]
*  I voted against the motion to proceed on that bill. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=285.88s)]
*  I support, strongly support aid for Ukraine to stand up to Putin's aggression. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=289.44s)]
*  But I think what the Congress has got to do is make it clear to Netanyahu that we're not [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=297.0s)]
*  going to simply give him a blank check to kill women and children in Palestine. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=302.36s)]
*  OK, White House officials say privately they don't think that the blowback from this war [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=307.88s)]
*  will impact them negatively with Democratic voters by the time we get to the presidential [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=314.56s)]
*  election. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=320.1s)]
*  Do you think they're miscalculating? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=321.1s)]
*  I think this war has been, I don't know the answer to that, but I think the war clearly [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=324.44s)]
*  has been very awful, not just among progressives, not just among Democrats. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=328.84s)]
*  The American people were outraged by the Hamas attack against Israel, rightfully so. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=334.4s)]
*  But they are equally outraged now by what Israel is doing. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=340.35999999999996s)]
*  So you're seeing all over this country people say, why are we giving money to an Israeli [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  government that is doing such awful things? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  Will it hurt politically? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=352.67999999999995s)]
*  It might. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=353.76s)]
*  At the end of the day, I think Biden is going to win this election. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=354.76s)]
*  What's going on now is not helpful. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=358.52s)]
*  I want to ask you about hate in this country and concerns around it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=361.12s)]
*  As you know, strong concern about anti-Semitism right now. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=366.08s)]
*  Congresswoman Elise Stefanik had a really pointed question and answer with university [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=370.92s)]
*  presidents this week. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=375.08s)]
*  One of those presidents has since resigned as a result of the fallout. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=376.44s)]
*  I wonder your thoughts of how far free speech should be protected when it is calling for [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=381.2s)]
*  genocide. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=387.24s)]
*  Well, I agree. Look, we believe strongly in free speech and academic years in areas where [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=389.64s)]
*  you're going to hear a lot of debate about issues that may make us uncomfortable. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  But at the end of the day, when somebody is saying they believe in genocide for the Jewish [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=399.72s)]
*  people or racist attacks against black Americans, et cetera, that is not acceptable, I think, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=405.04s)]
*  on a college campus where all of the students, black, Jewish, whatever, Islamic, have got [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=412.32s)]
*  to feel comfortable on campus. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=418.68s)]
*  Well, do you OK, Senator, we're going to have to leave it there because we are running out of [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=420.88s)]
*  time. But thank you. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=426.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=429.48s)]
*  Weighing in today and dealing with us through those audio problems. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhF7w5DzCQ&t=430.36s)]
