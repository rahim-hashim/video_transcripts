# Israeli military says it has only one division left inside Gaza
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs)
*  There is breaking news this morning. We are seeing some significant developments out of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel. The IDF has pulled some forces out of southern Gaza and Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  said they are one step away from victory. The Israelis will also send a delegation to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=10.92s)]
*  Cairo to meet with CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari and Egyptian officials to try to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=17.8s)]
*  negotiate both a ceasefire and to get the more than 130 hostages believed to be held by Hamas. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=23.4s)]
*  Six months into the war, the Israeli military says they've eliminated 12,000 terrorists in [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=31.0s)]
*  Gaza, but at the expense of thousands of Palestinian lives. The Gaza Health Ministry reports more than [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=38.32s)]
*  33,000 Palestinians have been killed. The aid organization Save the Children cites the number [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  of children killed in Gaza at 14,000. We'll hear from their president later in the broadcast. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=52.28s)]
*  We begin with our Holly Williams who's in Tel Aviv. Holly, what can you tell us about [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=59.36s)]
*  these developments and their significance? Good morning Margaret. Well Israel's military [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=65.16s)]
*  says it now only has one division inside the Gaza Strip. The other division that was there has left [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  in the last 24 hours. The remaining troops are all either along Gaza's border with Israel or north [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=77.08s)]
*  of an east-west road that bisects the Gaza Strip. The Israelis built that road recently, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=83.72s)]
*  it's thought as part of their planning for the day after the war. Now I spoke with an Israeli [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=89.48s)]
*  military spokesman a short while ago who told me that this is a quote evolution of the war effort [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=94.92s)]
*  and not a partial withdrawal. He would not give me any exact troop numbers. My colleague, CBS News [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=100.6s)]
*  producer Marwan Al Ghul is in southern Gaza and he says it is now possible to move freely from [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=107.16s)]
*  southern Gaza all the way up to central Gaza and that has not been possible for the past three months. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  Holly, there's also a lot of political pressure within Israel right now and these ongoing protests [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=120.12s)]
*  against the Netanyahu government. How is that affecting things? Well Margaret, we actually just [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=126.28s)]
*  heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu a short while ago ahead of a cabinet meeting here in Israel. He [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=131.56s)]
*  didn't mention this troop movement at all. In fact, he vowed that Israel would fight for total victory [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=136.68s)]
*  but he is under enormous pressure just as this news came out about these troops leaving Gaza. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=143.64s)]
*  There's also pressure from the right wing on Netanyahu not to give away too much to Hamas [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=149.64s)]
*  in negotiations and then on the other side of the political spectrum last night across Israel [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=154.68s)]
*  tens of thousands of people took part in anti-government protests. Many people here are [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=160.68s)]
*  angry with the government with their own leaders for not doing more to bring the remaining hostages [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  home and here in Tel Aviv a car rammed into a group of protesters injuring several people [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=171.24s)]
*  and opposition leader Yair Lapid said that the incident was quote the direct result of rising [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=177.72s)]
*  incitement from the government. So more criticism there for Benjamin Netanyahu. Margaret. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=183.72s)]
*  Holly Williams in Tel Aviv, thank you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfxERcZPaMs&t=189.8s)]
