# Trump says U.S. will meet with Iran next week, refutes early intel report
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM)
*  We are continuing our coverage of President Trump at the NATO summit in the Netherlands. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=0.0s)]
*  The president announced the U.S. will meet with Iran for nuclear talks next week. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=4.08s)]
*  This comes as the president continues to insist Iran's nuclear sites were obliterated after [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=8.8s)]
*  U.S. strikes on Sunday. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=13.52s)]
*  Take a listen to what he told reporters before he left the summit for Washington a little [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=14.72s)]
*  earlier. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=17.94s)]
*  The document said it could be very severe damage, but they didn't take that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=18.94s)]
*  They said it could be limited or it could be very severe. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=24.76s)]
*  They really didn't know, other than to say it could be limited or it could be very, very [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=28.28s)]
*  severe. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  And you didn't choose to put that because it was very early after. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=33.08s)]
*  Since then, we've collected additional intelligence. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=36.6s)]
*  We've also spoken to people who have seen the site, and the site is obliterated. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  And we think everything nuclear is down there. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=45.2s)]
*  They didn't take it out. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=47.6s)]
*  We are joined now by Jonathan Wattel, a global affairs analyst and former senior policy adviser [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=50.0s)]
*  at the U.S. mission to the United Nations. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=54.2s)]
*  OK, Jonathan, give me a moment because this is a wrinkle in the fabric here, right? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=56.16s)]
*  Early intelligence from the Pentagon reports that the damage to Iran's nuclear sites was [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=60.56s)]
*  perhaps not as great of a setback to the program as initially promised by the administration. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=64.9s)]
*  Israel also says its intelligence shows Iran's nuclear program was set back by years. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=70.64s)]
*  There's a clear discrepancy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=75.72s)]
*  I know these are preliminary reports, but what do you make of these differences here, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=76.72s)]
*  given the importance, obviously, of the president's agenda to eliminate the program? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=81.32s)]
*  So, sir, it is indeed a complicated situation. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=86.8s)]
*  A couple of the sites that were hit, they were actually really wiped out, one would [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=89.6s)]
*  say, like not tons. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=95.56s)]
*  Now, Fardau is a different thing altogether. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=96.56s)]
*  That's deep within a mountain. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=98.88s)]
*  It's hard to tell whether the bunker-busting bombs managed to cause so much of a shake [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  to not just destroy what was in the immediate proximity of the explosion itself, but be [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=106.84s)]
*  able to rattle things to such a degree on that mountain that it would cause a collapse [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=112.82s)]
*  and cause the dysfunction of the entire thing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  Now, we don't have eyes, ears, or the ability to see within there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=119.97999999999999s)]
*  So one of the things that needs to happen is over the course of time to be monitoring [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=124.22s)]
*  any chattering that may be going on amongst Iranian officials that might be able to give [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  us a glimpse as to how devastating that attack was. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=135.44s)]
*  And of course, you need to get inspections, actual physical presence in the area to see [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=138.94s)]
*  what they had down there. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=143.78s)]
*  So this is difficult. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=145.68s)]
*  But in terms of not tons, as I said, that got hit hard. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=146.84s)]
*  And what if anything is standing there, that's a different story altogether. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=150.66s)]
*  Yeah, and I think there's a question about whether Iran was able to maybe move, relocate [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=154.98s)]
*  any of the materials before these strikes happened. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=159.5s)]
*  It sounds like we really don't have any definitive answers on any of this yet, like you said. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=162.8s)]
*  Now, you mentioned these bunker-buster bombs. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=166.22s)]
*  I want to bring to your attention, you know, the satellite images that showed some of the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=168.98s)]
*  damage after at Fordow in particular effectively looked like holes in the ground. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=172.29999999999998s)]
*  We didn't see some of these widespread destruction that we saw at other sites because of the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=177.3s)]
*  use of these bunker-buster bombs. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=181.66s)]
*  It sounds like you're saying we really need to rely on some level of intelligence, perhaps [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=184.82s)]
*  even diplomatic channels, to figure out how effective these bunker-buster bombs were. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=189.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=194.66s)]
*  I mean, one of the problems, Sarah, is the Iranians have not been particularly forthcoming [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=195.66s)]
*  throughout the process, throughout actually the decades of negotiations with them. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=200.02s)]
*  It was, you know, the Fordow facility was discovered by intelligence. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=204.32s)]
*  The Iranians never disclosed that they had a site there. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=210.1s)]
*  So what else is out there? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=213.7s)]
*  They've always played this game of cat and mouse. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=215.18s)]
*  So we do not know, you mentioned that some of the nuclear materials could have been, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=217.68s)]
*  and the centrifuges could have been moved to other facilities. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=221.78s)]
*  Iran's a very large country. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=224.94s)]
*  It is, you know, not the size of the United States, but certainly you can combine a couple [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=226.94s)]
*  of major U.S. states and you end up with a country the size of Iran. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=230.9s)]
*  That's a lot of territory, and they already are known to have this clandestine operation [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=235.46s)]
*  aspect to what they do. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=241.3s)]
*  In fact, even during the JCPOA, the nuclear deal that was signed in 2015, IAEA, UN, Watchdog [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=243.08s)]
*  inspectors were not allowed on all of the sites even then. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=251.42s)]
*  So there's a lot of unknown here. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=255.73999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it sounds like this was a calculated risk by the president, right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=257.58s)]
*  It seemed like he wanted to eliminate the nuclear program and then resume talks, which [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=261.18s)]
*  I think seemed counterintuitive to some people. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=265.14s)]
*  And now there's this question mark. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=267.86s)]
*  But Iran is also saying that they are not going to cooperate with the U.N. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=269.09999999999997s)]
*  I guess what does that mean for these greater efforts to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=273.41999999999996s)]
*  given the fact that we really don't know where they stand right now? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=278.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's a divisive position amongst diplomats and other people who have [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=282.26s)]
*  been scrutinizing this situation for a long time. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=287.06s)]
*  One is that if you have the IAEA inspectors in there, you have a deal. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=290.46s)]
*  At least there's some modicum of scrutiny that's taking place, which is better than [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=294.62s)]
*  having nothing. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=299.26s)]
*  Then there's the opinion that even that wasn't enough, that the Iranians are hell-bent on [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=300.62s)]
*  getting atomic weapons and there's nothing you can do about it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=305.29999999999995s)]
*  And the only way to deal with this is to take a measure like what we just have seen happen [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=309.78000000000003s)]
*  in which you really try to set back whatever their aspirations are. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=314.58s)]
*  Or ultimately, you end up in a situation in which you end up with a government there that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=319.22s)]
*  is going to be held accountable, that's going to listen, that's going to have a view on [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=323.86s)]
*  the world that is less hegemonic as what we saw Iran do across the Middle East and into [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=328.26s)]
*  Saudi Arabian Peninsula, in Yemen and elsewhere, a posture that's less of a pariah state and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=334.38000000000005s)]
*  more of a country that is playing a constructive role among nations. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=341.14000000000004s)]
*  All right, Jonathan Wattel, obviously uncertain times, but thank you so much for your insights. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=345.34000000000003s)]
*  Lots of questions out there to answer, but we appreciate you walking us through that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vghf1mMCWM&t=350.94000000000005s)]
