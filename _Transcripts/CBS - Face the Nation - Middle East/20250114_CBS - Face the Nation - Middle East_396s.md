# Sources say Israel and Hamas may soon finalize ceasefire-hostage deal
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw)
*  We're following developing news out of the Middle East tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=0.0s)]
*  Sources tell CBS News that both Israel and Hamas have agreed in principle to a ceasefire [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=4.5s)]
*  and hostage deal. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=10.02s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Rami Anasensio is in Tel Aviv with more. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=11.36s)]
*  CBS News has learned from U.S., Israeli and Arab officials that the draft for a ceasefire [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=17.28s)]
*  and hostage deal has been agreed to in principle. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=23.84s)]
*  And if it all carries on smoothly, then Israel and Hamas will finalize it this week. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=28.12s)]
*  Today, an Israeli government official here in Tel Aviv who wants to be anonymous told [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=33.68s)]
*  us the outlines of that deal. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=37.52s)]
*  In phase one, Hamas would release 33 hostages made up of women, the elderly, the sick and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=39.8s)]
*  some children in exchange for a higher number of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  As for Israel's military presence in Gaza, that official said that assets, which we're [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=53.92s)]
*  understanding to mean military assets, would remain in Gaza and that the IDF would establish [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=59.32s)]
*  a security buffer zone between southern Gaza and Israel. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=65.28s)]
*  And as for the people of Gaza, humanitarian aid, which we know is so desperately needed [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  now, especially the height of winter, would be surged. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  The latest number we have on the death toll is over 46 and a half thousand people. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=78.8s)]
*  That just crossed the 46,000 mark only last week. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=83.88s)]
*  Pushing ahead to phase two, talks on that would start during phase one and with the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=87.96s)]
*  goal of releasing younger hostages and Israeli soldiers. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=92.92s)]
*  But first, of course, phase one has to be agreed. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=97.92s)]
*  If it does, implementation could start this weekend with hostages starting to be released. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=100.0s)]
*  The last time that happened was more than a year ago. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=103.88s)]
*  But reminder, we have been here before. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=106.56s)]
*  Many times talks could collapse at any minute. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=109.0s)]
*  I'm not saying you're cynical, but again, one more time, there is that feeling of hope [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=111.76s)]
*  and that official says in large part because of the U.S. and the double backing of the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=116.12s)]
*  outgoing Biden White House and the incoming Trump White House. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=121.04s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=125.0s)]
*  Remy, in a sense, thank you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=126.0s)]
*  CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd joins us now for some analysis. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  Sam, great to see you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=133.28s)]
*  So we've been reporting for months now of these stalled negotiations and that they could [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  be on the horizon here. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=140.0s)]
*  But I'm curious what happened in Qatar to actually get to where we stand today? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=142.16s)]
*  Well, there certainly is a sense of deja vu as we hope that we're on a precipice of a [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=148.88s)]
*  ceasefire and hostage release negotiation. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=153.72s)]
*  I think certain factors have materially changed. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=156.84s)]
*  In the first instance, Bibi Netanyahu has had more time to try to accomplish his military [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=159.96s)]
*  objectives in Gaza. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=165.52s)]
*  Previously, a sticking point has been Bibi Netanyahu insisting on the complete decimation [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=167.84s)]
*  of Hamas while the U.S. administration has pointed out their view that he had accomplished [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=173.36s)]
*  his military objectives there. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=179.0s)]
*  There was a difference there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=180.52s)]
*  Further, Hamas has been very focused on ensuring that Israel withdraws from some key strategic [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=181.88000000000002s)]
*  areas known as the Philadelphia corridor and some other buffer zones in parts of Gaza. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=188.44s)]
*  Israel now seems to have backed off their insistence regarding those territories, likely [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=194.44s)]
*  again because Netanyahu feels that he's accomplished more of his military objectives. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=199.0s)]
*  Netanyahu is under even more increased pressure domestically. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=203.6s)]
*  And we do have the Trump factor here. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=207.8s)]
*  I don't think that Prime Minister Netanyahu makes decisions solely based on what Donald [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=210.24s)]
*  Trump has to say, but Donald Trump has been pressuring Netanyahu both directly and through [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=214.96s)]
*  his Middle East envoy to be Steve Witkoff to make a deal. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=220.44s)]
*  And the Middle East peace is one area that Biden and Netanyahu agree on. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=225.2s)]
*  And so their two envoys, Brett McGurk and Steve Witkoff, have been working very close [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  concert to try to get this job done. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=234.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's really notable how well those teams have been working together. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=237.36s)]
*  I mean, Steve Witkoff has commended the Biden administration for how they're including them [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=241.68s)]
*  in these in these negotiations. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=247.12s)]
*  You heard Ramey kind of lay out these three different stages of this plan. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=249.48s)]
*  I'm wondering what your biggest takeaways are. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=253.16s)]
*  Well, if history is prologue, we know that phase one, hopefully we get to phase one and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=256.28s)]
*  we see the release of 33 Israeli hostages, including women and children, as well as other [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=262.36s)]
*  male hostages at some juncture. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=269.28s)]
*  But if we can just get to phase one, that is a major accomplishment, both in terms of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=271.44s)]
*  the Israeli hostages and in terms of allowing more aid in. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=275.56s)]
*  That is part of the phase one agreement. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=279.52s)]
*  However, the last time we were here, we got through phase one and never got to a phase two. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=282.08s)]
*  And so it is quite possible that we do see a hostage release, prisoner release, additional [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=288.16s)]
*  aid in for some period of weeks and other conditions under phase one, but never get to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=294.24s)]
*  a phase two. But even that would be an improvement upon where we are today, as the people of [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=299.96s)]
*  Gaza are starving and Israeli hostages have been in captivity for just far too long. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=304.44s)]
*  And since we seem to be closer to a deal than we ever have before, I'm wondering what [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=310.68s)]
*  kinds of things you're looking at that could derail this altogether. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=316.32s)]
*  Well, I think it is clear an important factor here on the Israeli side is that this is not a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=322.08s)]
*  deal that President-elect Trump would pull back from once inaugurated on Monday. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=326.12s)]
*  So the Israelis know that they would have both the Biden administration's support and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=332.04s)]
*  President-elect Trump's support. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=336.52000000000004s)]
*  What could derail this deal is if the ceasefire that is supposed to be in effect for six [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=337.92s)]
*  weeks in phase one is derailed by either Hamas or other terrorist group action against [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=344.8s)]
*  Israel during this six week period, or if Israel launches military incursions into Gaza, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=352.12s)]
*  or if humanitarian assistance is not allowed in to the degree that Israel pledges it would. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=358.8s)]
*  So there are a lot of factors that could throw this off. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=365.6s)]
*  But importantly, in the very first days of this deal, we would already see hostages released in [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=368.16s)]
*  exchange for Palestinian prisoners. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=375.84s)]
*  So even that would be an improvement from an Israeli perspective from where we are today. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=377.64s)]
*  And hopefully more aid will get in very quickly as well to help the people of Gaza. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=381.72s)]
*  Yes, we are all hoping for some kind of deal to go through. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  Sam Vinograd, thank you as always for your time. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=391.08s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=393.47999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmyP72NJyw&t=395.23999999999995s)]
