# H.R. McMaster criticizes Biden's threat to stop weapons shipment to Israel
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg)
*  Well, tensions between Israel and the U.S. are growing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=0.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that his country will stand alone if it has to [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  after President Biden announced the U.S. would pause certain military weapons to Israel if [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=7.36s)]
*  it launches an offensive on Gaza's southern city of Ra'aq. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=12.72s)]
*  So for more on all of this, let's bring in CBS News foreign policy and national security [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=16.0s)]
*  contributor Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=20.48s)]
*  He also served as national security advisor in the Trump administration. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=23.06s)]
*  Very nice to have you here. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=27.3s)]
*  Thank you, President Biden. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=28.8s)]
*  We're speaking remotely, so it's good to have you here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=29.8s)]
*  Let us talk about this new stance coming from the White House that President Biden is willing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=31.92s)]
*  to halt the delivery of some military aid to Israel. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=37.84s)]
*  Depending on what they do in Ra'aq, I've heard some praise for this move. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=42.16s)]
*  I've heard some criticism. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=46.32s)]
*  What does it really mean? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=47.6s)]
*  Well, Anne-Marie, I'm really disappointed about it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=48.6s)]
*  I just have to tell you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=50.96s)]
*  I mean, I think it's feckless on the part of the Biden administration. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=51.96s)]
*  I think it's really important to note that Hamas has said they want every day to be like [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=56.16s)]
*  October 7th. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=61.36s)]
*  And so I don't see how the Israelis have any other option but to destroy Hamas. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  And in Ra'aq, I mean, just yesterday, the Israeli Defense Forces in the limited operation [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=68.32s)]
*  of Ra'aq destroyed 10 tunnels. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=72.6s)]
*  And so this is where Hamas's leadership is cowering. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=74.56s)]
*  This is where they're holding the hostages. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=78.14s)]
*  They've killed many of those hostages. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=80.4s)]
*  On the same day that President Biden likened October 7th to the Holocaust, that's the same [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=82.72s)]
*  day he's cutting off munitions. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=88.56s)]
*  Now I think it's a valid concern to say the IDF has to do more, do everything they can [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=90.64s)]
*  to minimize civilian casualties. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=96.28s)]
*  That's valid. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  But now to say you can't go into Ra'aq, actually, from a military perspective, they have to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  go in. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  And when you begin a major operation into Ra'aq, that's when you're going to have fewer [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  civilian casualties. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=109.2s)]
*  When you do these raids into Ra'aq and you have to use air power and you have an unclear [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  knowledge of the situation and you don't have troops in close contact who can discriminate [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=115.72s)]
*  between combatants and non-combatants, that's when the civilian casualties are higher. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=121.0s)]
*  So it doesn't make sense from a military perspective to say don't go into Ra'aq. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=126.2s)]
*  And I think it's kind of feckless behavior. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=130.6s)]
*  I think actually he seems to me to be pandering to kind of the self-loathing far left that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  we see taking over U.S. campuses and engaged in pro-Hamas activity. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=138.64s)]
*  Let me ask you, General, we should also say that you can be against the loss of civilian [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=144.28s)]
*  life in Gaza and not be pro-Hamas, right? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=151.84s)]
*  Absolutely, yes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=153.92s)]
*  You can for those young students who are protesting. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=154.92s)]
*  But let me ask you just again to dig down a little deeper into what you were suggesting. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=157.16s)]
*  I wondered from a tactical standpoint, why do we need these types of bombs in an area [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=160.4s)]
*  It's not like Russia and Ukraine. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=166.76s)]
*  There isn't a military, like a regular army fighting the IDF. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=169.0s)]
*  Why not to limit casualties, send in the IDF with tanks, with personnel and try to secure [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=174.16s)]
*  Ra'aq that way as opposed to dropping indiscriminate bombs on the civilian population? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=180.64s)]
*  Well, an important factor is at times when you're in a dense urban area, you have to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=185.72s)]
*  deal with like three dimensions and tall buildings. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=191.11999999999998s)]
*  But in Ra'aq, there's a subterranean dimension to this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  So on occasion, what you need to do is have like delayed fuses, for example, for bombs [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=198.56s)]
*  that actually don't do a lot of collateral damage because they penetrate first and then [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  explode. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=207.56s)]
*  But what's also important about these munitions is they're very important to securing Israel's [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=208.6s)]
*  northern border. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=213.0s)]
*  And Hezbollah is very active in southern Lebanon. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  Just yesterday they fired a lot of rockets and missiles. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=217.83999999999997s)]
*  You have to remember there are 70,000 Israelis who are evacuated from northern Israel. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=220.44000000000003s)]
*  These are families that are displaced. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=226.04000000000002s)]
*  They want to get back to their homes. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  And what the IDF is using many of these munitions for now is in southern Lebanon. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=229.36s)]
*  Every time there's a rocket fired from southern Lebanon, there's a big IDF response with some [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  of these munitions. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  Before we let you go, I want to ask you about the situation with the war in Ukraine. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  There is some news that Russia is launching sort of a new attack, particularly in the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=243.4s)]
*  Harkiv area. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=248.68s)]
*  I think that there is military aid coming in the coming weeks, I think was what was [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=249.88s)]
*  said, which is rather vague. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=255.8s)]
*  Has this war fallen off the radar for the U.S.? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=259.68s)]
*  You know, I think it's not off the radar, but I think we delayed so long. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=262.36s)]
*  Because of this narrow majority, Republican majority in Congress, in a degree it's super [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=266.52s)]
*  empowered some of the neo-isolationists far right, that delayed so much of this assistance. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=270.96000000000004s)]
*  And hey, the laws of physics still apply. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=277.8s)]
*  Even though that has passed through Congress, and I'm so glad it did, it's going to take [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=280.12s)]
*  a while to get those munitions there. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=283.36s)]
*  And as General Douglas MacArthur said, every strategic failure can be summed up in two [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  words, too late. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=289.76s)]
*  So we have to hope that this hasn't been too late. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=291.64000000000004s)]
*  General H.R. McMaster, always great to have you, and especially here in person. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=294.68s)]
*  We really appreciate that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=298.68s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RufqPp7z9rg&t=301.96000000000004s)]
