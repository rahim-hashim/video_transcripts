# UNICEF chief Catherine Russell says death toll of children in Gaza is "staggering"
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [March 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY)
*  According to UNICEF, 81% of households in Gaza [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=0.0s)]
*  don't have enough access to clean water, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=3.24s)]
*  and nine in 10 people do not have enough food to survive. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=5.7s)]
*  The organization's executive director is Katherine Russell, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=9.84s)]
*  and she's here with us. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=12.84s)]
*  Welcome to Face the Nation. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=14.84s)]
*  Thank you very much. Thanks. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=16.04s)]
*  You focus in particular on the children. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=17.28s)]
*  We heard this week from the leaders [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=20.94s)]
*  of the U.S. intelligence community [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=23.28s)]
*  that there will be a generational impact [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=24.78s)]
*  from what is happening in Gaza, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=29.159999999999997s)]
*  the implications of that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=31.24s)]
*  They were looking through the national security lens. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=32.44s)]
*  From your perspective, what does that mean? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=35.98s)]
*  What does the generational impact mean? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, it means that what's happening now [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=39.78s)]
*  is more than 13,000 children already have been killed, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=42.08s)]
*  which is an astronomical, horrifying number. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=45.28s)]
*  Thousands more have been injured, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  or we can't even determine where they are. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  They may be stuck under rubble. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=52.36s)]
*  Thousands more have lost one or both parents. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=53.959999999999994s)]
*  Some of these children, you've seen them on the news, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=56.9s)]
*  they're just by themselves managing their younger siblings. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  I mean, it's a horrifying situation. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=62.32s)]
*  So when you think about the impact of that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=63.82s)]
*  on those children as they grow up, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=66.26s)]
*  even on their children, right, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=67.76s)]
*  it is an impact that is so profound [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=69.56s)]
*  because of the stress that they're living under [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=72.4s)]
*  and the grief and the loss and the fear [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=74.46000000000001s)]
*  that they're living under. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=77.26s)]
*  It's bound to have impacts on them the rest of their lives. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=78.46000000000001s)]
*  Since October 7th, 33 Israeli children have been killed [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  in those horrific attacks of that day. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=87.72s)]
*  As you just said, 13,000 in Gaza that you know of. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=89.86s)]
*  That we know of. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=94.86s)]
*  That's just horrific for the youngest. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=97.84s)]
*  It's all horrific. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=99.64s)]
*  You know, honestly, the children who were killed in Israel, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=100.74s)]
*  the children who were taken hostage, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=102.84s)]
*  there are still children who have not been returned [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=105.48s)]
*  to their families in Israel, all horrific, right? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=108.48s)]
*  Every one of those cases is so heartbreaking [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=112.08s)]
*  for that child and that family. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=114.88s)]
*  I think these numbers that we're seeing out of Gaza [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  are just staggering. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  I mean, we haven't seen that rate of death among children [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=120.88s)]
*  in almost any other conflict in the world. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=124.58s)]
*  It's really shocking. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=127.16s)]
*  So your organization says 31% of children, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=128.98s)]
*  one in three under the age of two, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=132.56s)]
*  in northern Gaza suffer from acute malnutrition. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  This isn't just trauma. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=141.26s)]
*  This is stunting them for life. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=142.56s)]
*  Well, if they survive. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=146.2s)]
*  And I have to say, I've seen a lot of children, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  unfortunately, in my job around the world [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  who suffer from malnutrition. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=152.33999999999997s)]
*  And it is a shocking thing to see. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=153.78s)]
*  I mean, essentially, the body starts to consume itself [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=156.42s)]
*  because it has nothing else. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=159.78s)]
*  And it's a painful, painful death for children. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=160.88s)]
*  I've been in wards of children who are suffering [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=163.67999999999998s)]
*  from severe malnutrition. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=166.22s)]
*  The whole ward is absolutely quiet [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=167.89999999999998s)]
*  because the children, the babies, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=170.12s)]
*  don't even have the energy to cry. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=172.06s)]
*  I mean, it is a devastating thing to see. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  And you're right, if they survive it, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=176.8s)]
*  if we can manage to get, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  what we do is provide therapeutic feeding for them. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  If we can get that to them, they can survive. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=182.96s)]
*  But often they're stunted for life. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=184.84s)]
*  And stunting means that your ability, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=186.24s)]
*  your cognitive ability is impacted as well. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=189.28s)]
*  So it is a lifelong challenge for these children [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=191.28s)]
*  if they survive. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  But we know now that children are dying [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  from malnutrition in Gaza. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=196.84s)]
*  The CIA director testified about children starving in Gaza. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=198.72000000000003s)]
*  What are you able to actually get in at this point? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  And we know there are airdrops happening. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=206.8s)]
*  You can't airdrop vaccines. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  You can't airdrop things that need to be refrigerated. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=211.66s)]
*  So what's getting in and what do you need to get in? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=214.3s)]
*  Well, first of all, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=216.24s)]
*  the one thing we know for sure is not enough is getting in. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  And the airdrops are, as you say, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=220.14000000000001s)]
*  some things are coming in that way. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  Some things came in through this maritime corridor, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  but it's a drop in the bucket in both cases. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  And what we need to get in for children is what I said, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  is this therapeutic feeding, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=231.94s)]
*  which is something called plumpy nut. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=233.17999999999998s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever seen it, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=234.48s)]
*  but it's fantastic and it can save their lives. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=235.57999999999998s)]
*  But we need to get it to them. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=237.88s)]
*  And we have so little access right now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=239.01999999999998s)]
*  And it's very challenging. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=241.45999999999998s)]
*  We also are facing very great bureaucratic challenges [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=242.76s)]
*  moving trucks in. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=246.06s)]
*  Trucks and moving things by land is by far [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  the most efficient, effective way to get aid in. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=250.16s)]
*  But there are a lot of challenges to that where we can't, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  I think Senator Van Hollen mentioned [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=255.64s)]
*  if things are dual use, sometimes they get rejected. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=258.09999999999997s)]
*  We can't get plastic pipes in. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=261.36s)]
*  We can't get some medical kits [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=263.04s)]
*  if they have a little scissors in them. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=264.56s)]
*  I mean, it's completely almost Kafkaesque of times [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  trying to figure out how we get things in [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=269.24s)]
*  through this bureaucratic mess. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  And I think at the end of the day, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=272.44s)]
*  those are choices that are made. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=273.88s)]
*  If the choice is- [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=275.68s)]
*  Those are political choices. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  They are choices. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  And I think if the choice is to say, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=278.74s)]
*  we need to get as much humanitarian aid flooded [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=280.48s)]
*  into this area as possible, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=283.62s)]
*  everyone can do better in that regard. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=286.26s)]
*  And I think that the population there [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=288.34s)]
*  is suffering in such a terrible way. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=291.28s)]
*  And I think one of the big challenges is [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=293.78s)]
*  because there's such limited access for the press. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=296.28s)]
*  In addition, it's hard to see that, right? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=299.86s)]
*  And I think it would be great [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=302.06s)]
*  if there were more transparency, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=303.52s)]
*  if everyone could see what the challenges are, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=305.32s)]
*  what the legitimate bottlenecks are [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=307.46s)]
*  and how we could all do better. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=309.56s)]
*  We rely on our producer who lives in Gaza, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=310.86s)]
*  Marwan al Ghul, but we cannot get in. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=314.14s)]
*  You're correct. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=316.53999999999996s)]
*  It should be. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=317.76s)]
*  You should be able to get in. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=318.6s)]
*  You should be able to see what's happening. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=319.76s)]
*  The world should be able to see what's happening [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=321.06s)]
*  and make their own judgments about what's going on. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=322.1s)]
*  Yes, the Israeli government has not permitted that to date. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=324.3s)]
*  The ongoing crisis in Haiti, I need to ask you about that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=327.58s)]
*  This is so close to US shores. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=332.08s)]
*  Americans are watching it now. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=333.74s)]
*  What is happening there? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=336.34s)]
*  I read that two thirds of children need aid. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=337.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=340.02s)]
*  Haiti is a horrific situation. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=340.94s)]
*  I was there several months ago. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=343.06s)]
*  There was so much violence even then, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=345.5s)]
*  and there were gangs who were controlling parts [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=347.41999999999996s)]
*  of the capital. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=350.06s)]
*  Now they've basically taken over the capital. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=350.88s)]
*  They've taken over the airport. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=352.78s)]
*  What that means for people is that we can't get aid in. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=354.46s)]
*  Again, it's very difficult for us to do that. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=357.06s)]
*  Many, many people there are suffering [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=359.7s)]
*  from serious hunger and malnutrition, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=361.5s)]
*  and we're not able to get enough aid to them. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=364.02s)]
*  It's almost like a scene out of Mad Max, honestly. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=366.7s)]
*  That's what it seems like. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=370.85999999999996s)]
*  Gangs, vigilantes responding to the gangs. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=371.78s)]
*  Somehow we need to get more control over that situation [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=374.70000000000005s)]
*  so that we can get the humanitarian response in. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=377.46000000000004s)]
*  And so that this population that has suffered [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=380.02000000000004s)]
*  one thing after another over the years, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=382.70000000000005s)]
*  earthquakes, cholera, COVID, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=384.48s)]
*  it's literally one thing after another for Haiti. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=388.06s)]
*  And I think right now it's the worst [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=390.22s)]
*  that anyone has seen in decades. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=392.02000000000004s)]
*  That's saying a lot. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=394.62s)]
*  That's saying a lot. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=395.78000000000003s)]
*  Catherine Russell, thank you for sharing your insights. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=397.78000000000003s)]
*  Thanks, Mark. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYKM6Jr1isY&t=400.78000000000003s)]
