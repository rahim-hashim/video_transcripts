# Joy in Syria after Assad's fall but also fears that Islamist victors will rule as al Qaeda 2.0
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [December 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY)
*  Scenes of jubilation in Damascus as thousands of Syrians mark the first [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=0.0s)]
*  Friday prayer since the fall of the Assad regime one week ago. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=3.7600000000000002s)]

*  I have never seen Damascus so filled with joy. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=11.36s)]
*  Bashar al-Assad, the dictator, had fled to Moscow. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=16.16s)]
*  And just like that, the fear of saying something that might get you arrested was gone. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=19.76s)]
*  The Islamist fighters who'd seized power a week ago were partying too. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=25.919999999999998s)]
*  In the main souq, shoppers walked on Assad's face. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=32.96s)]
*  While at Sidneya prison where his critics were tortured and killed, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=37.04s)]
*  crowds poured into what Syrians used to call the slaughterhouse. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=41.92s)]
*  It's some kind of maybe underground holding cells. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=47.36s)]
*  This is where political prisoners were disappeared. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=52.239999999999995s)]

*  Dark, damp, smelly, cold. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=57.2s)]
*  All week, families combed the cells for clues [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=61.6s)]
*  that might tell them what happened to their husbands, their fathers, their sons. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=65.12s)]
*  In a house near Damascus, we met an American, Travis Timmerman, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=71.04s)]
*  who'd entered Syria illegally and been locked up in an Assad jail since May. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=74.88s)]
*  You've got more than you bargained for, haven't you? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=80.16s)]
*  Huh. Well, I'm here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=82.24s)]
*  You're lying. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=86.56s)]
*  He is a lucky man. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=87.44s)]
*  As soon as the regime fell, local people set him and the rest of prisoners free. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  At the ancient Umayyad Mosque, the fighters' leader, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=96.88s)]
*  Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, was welcomed, a conquering hero. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=100.16s)]
*  He's changed his look from the old days when he was affiliated with al-Qaeda, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  and a master of modern messaging he posted on X, too, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=110.16s)]
*  inviting all Syrians to join in rebuilding the country. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=113.6s)]
*  His inner circle has promised elections in March, but not everyone buys it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=118.24s)]
*  Rumours are spreading like wildfire that, no matter what they say, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=124.08s)]
*  these men mean to rule like al-Qaeda 2.0. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=128.88s)]
*  Syrians are afraid, especially the Christian and Alawite minorities, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=134.0s)]
*  that when the dust settles, they'll find that a new tyranny has simply replaced the old. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=138.56s)]
*  That's Elizabeth Palmer in Damascus. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHhhVbErjY&t=145.52s)]
