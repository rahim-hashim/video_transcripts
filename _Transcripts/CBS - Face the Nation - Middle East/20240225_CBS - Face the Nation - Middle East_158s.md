# Donald Trump trounces Nikki Haley in South Carolina primary
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [February 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc)
*  Yesterday's South Carolina Republican primary turned out as expected, with a big win for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=5.32s)]
*  Last night in Charleston, former governor and UN ambassador Nikki Haley put her best [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=6.96s)]
*  spin on the result. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=11.16s)]
*  I'm going to count it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=12.64s)]
*  I know 40 percent is not 50 percent. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=14.92s)]
*  But I also know 40 percent is not some tiny group. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=19.96s)]
*  As for the former president, his Friday night remarks at the Black Conservative Federation [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=25.72s)]
*  Gala in Columbia, South Carolina, continued to overshadow his victory. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=30.28s)]
*  Black conservatives understand better than most that some of the greatest evils in our [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=35.8s)]
*  nation's history have come from corrupt systems that try to target and subjugate others to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=40.5s)]
*  deny them their freedom and to deny them their rights. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  You understand that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=49.76s)]
*  I think that's why the black people are so much on my side now, because they see what's [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=50.76s)]
*  happening to me happens to them. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=55.5s)]
*  These lights are so bright in my eyes that I can't see too many people out there. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=57.980000000000004s)]
*  But I can only see the black ones. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=63.42s)]
*  I can't see any white ones. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=66.54s)]
*  That's how far I've come. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  We begin with CBS News chief election and campaign correspondent Robert Costa, who joins [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=71.3s)]
*  us from Charleston. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=76.14s)]
*  Bob, this was an open primary in South Carolina, but just three percent of voters were black. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=77.7s)]
*  Do Donald Trump's remarks about black Americans give the party any pause here? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=84.7s)]
*  It's giving Nikki Haley a road ahead at this point, Margaret. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=91.18s)]
*  She and her campaign believe there are many traditional Republicans across the country [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  who are fed up not only with former President Trump's legal problems, but his incendiary [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=99.22s)]
*  comments on race. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=103.78s)]
*  And they believe that that could ostracize key voters across the country come November. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=105.42s)]
*  That's why she's staying in right now, going to Michigan this week for that primary, staying [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=110.36s)]
*  in through Super Tuesday. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=114.68s)]
*  But there is real worry that as Trump takes over the party and the Republican National [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=116.48s)]
*  Committee, there's no reckoning about how he's handling issues like race and immigration. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=120.36s)]
*  How long can Nikki Haley stay in the race? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=125.8s)]
*  As long as there's money. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=129.04s)]
*  I've been talking to donors over the past 12 hours and they say they're going to keep [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=130.24s)]
*  pouring money into her campaign and into her super PAC. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=133.64s)]
*  At the same time, they know that Super Tuesday come early March, that's going to be a real [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=137.6s)]
*  crossroads for her going past Super Tuesday, going to be very difficult in terms of organization [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=142.04s)]
*  and fundraising. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  And she has told reporters in recent days that she's not thinking beyond that at this [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=149.06s)]
*  point. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=153.16s)]
*  Day to day. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=154.16s)]
*  All right, Robert Costa, thank you. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9Jxpwf0lc&t=155.16s)]
