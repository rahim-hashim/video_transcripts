# Israel vows retaliation after deadly Golan Heights attack
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo)
*  Tensions are escalating in the Middle East this morning as Israel vows to retaliate after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=0.0s)]
*  a deadly rocket attack killed 12 children and injured dozens in the Golan Heights area [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=4.7s)]
*  Saturday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=9.4s)]
*  Both Israel and the U.S. are blaming Lebanon's militant group Hezbollah for the strike, though [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=10.4s)]
*  Hezbollah has denied responsibility. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=15.08s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent MTS Tayyab is in Beirut, Lebanon with the latest on this [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  weekend's attack. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=22.44s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=23.44s)]
*  What kind of retaliation could we be talking about here? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=25.779999999999998s)]
*  Marie, good to be with you too. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=29.78s)]
*  Listen, we've been trying to get to Beirut for the last 24 hours and we were basically [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=34.74s)]
*  unable to because a number of flights had been cancelled by airlines who had very legitimate [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=40.92s)]
*  concerns that Israel were going to carry out pretty serious strikes here inside Lebanon, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  potentially here in Beirut where I am now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=52.74s)]
*  Now that hasn't happened. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=56.58s)]
*  We know that Israel's security cabinet met last night after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=58.5s)]
*  Netanyahu returned back to Israel, cut short that trip in Washington, D.C. that he had [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=63.260000000000005s)]
*  when he addressed Congress there. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=69.98s)]
*  But what we do know is that Israel and Israeli officials have said that they are going to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=72.94s)]
*  carry out strikes that will, and I'm quoting here Anne-Marie Hurt, however, they have [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=77.14s)]
*  said what they don't want is to trigger an all-out war with Hezbollah. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=82.58s)]
*  But it really begs the question, how do you carry out strikes that, again, in Israeli [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=89.34s)]
*  officials' own words, that hurts but does not trigger a major response from Hezbollah? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=93.94s)]
*  Anne-Marie. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=100.74s)]
*  Really, especially when you have the Lebanese Hezbollah movement denying that they were [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=101.74s)]
*  involved in this at all. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=108.5s)]
*  Now they have been trading fire with Israeli forces basically since October 7th. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=109.9s)]
*  What proof have they offered that they were not involved in this latest attack? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=115.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very good question. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=120.9s)]
*  And the short answer is that they haven't really offered anything beyond a denial. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=125.66000000000001s)]
*  And we've been talking to people here in Lebanon about why Hezbollah would deny it, some suggesting [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=129.78s)]
*  that small factions may have been responsible, though Israel is saying that the munition [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=137.26s)]
*  used in that strike, that devastating strike, Anne-Marie, in which 12 people were killed, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=142.54s)]
*  many under the age of 15, that it's pretty much certain that it was carried out by Hezbollah, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=148.54s)]
*  whatever the case, as there are certainly attempts not just from Hezbollah to dial things [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=156.74s)]
*  down to ensure that we don't see a major escalation in violence, including from the U.S. and other [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=162.82s)]
*  regional partners as well. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=168.78s)]
*  You point out a very crucial issue here, which is almost immediately after Hamas's deadly [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=171.14s)]
*  October 7th attack, Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel nearly every single day. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=177.62s)]
*  In fact, I'm going to read some numbers out to you, which I find just staggering. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=184.62s)]
*  These figures come from Event Data Project, which analyzed a number of these strikes, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=189.7s)]
*  almost all of them, and they say that combined strikes, cross-border attacks between the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=195.1s)]
*  8th of October and the 5th of July, number 7,491. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=199.89999999999998s)]
*  Here in Lebanon, over 90,000 people in southern Lebanon have been displaced, over 100 civilians [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=208.06s)]
*  have been killed, and several hundred Lebanese fighters or Hezbollah fighters as well. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=216.34s)]
*  It really just underscores the fact that although there's this huge attempt to not see a major [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=221.9s)]
*  war escalate, we've already seen extraordinary and tragic violence. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=227.26s)]
*  There are people suggesting that a wider war is already underway, and when you see those [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=233.5s)]
*  numbers you can understand why someone would argue that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=238.98000000000002s)]
*  Here's the thing though, Hezbollah, backed by Iran, much more formidable opponent to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=242.5s)]
*  Israel than Hamas, and Israel is already clearly at war. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=247.98s)]
*  There must be concerns that the Israeli military just is not ready, and certainly the Israeli [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=254.18s)]
*  population would not be interested, but the Israeli military is not ready to take on another [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=260.3s)]
*  opponent. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=264.42s)]
*  Well, as you know, I've been covering Israel for many years, especially since October the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=266.34000000000003s)]
*  7th. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=273.94s)]
*  The Israeli military is exhausted. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=274.94s)]
*  Israeli soldiers have been cycled through Gaza over and over again. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=277.5s)]
*  They're running low on weapons and munitions. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=282.78000000000003s)]
*  The idea of starting or engaging in an all-out war with Hezbollah, which as you said is a [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=286.54s)]
*  formidable fighting force, far more than Hamas has ever been able to be, would be devastating, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=294.18s)]
*  not just for Israel, but also for Lebanon as well. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=301.18s)]
*  But some of our viewers at home might be wondering, why is Hezbollah so powerful? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=306.22s)]
*  Well, it's like you said, Emre, because of that connection with Iran, and that connection [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=310.02s)]
*  with Iran is connected to what was happening next door in Syria. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=316.38s)]
*  That devastating civil war in Syria in which Hezbollah fought alongside Bashar al-Assad, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=322.18s)]
*  the Syrian president who carried out horrific violence against his own people, the deaths [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=328.94s)]
*  of hundreds of thousands of Syrians, and he is still in power. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=334.38s)]
*  And so Hezbollah learned to fight. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=339.22s)]
*  They are far, far more well-trained and have far more powerful weapons than anything Israel [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=341.86s)]
*  has encountered with Hezbollah in previous conflicts. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=348.53999999999996s)]
*  And so if a war happens, because of what may come in the next 24 hours or so, it will be [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=351.73999999999995s)]
*  very, very devastating. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=358.73999999999995s)]
*  Emre. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=360.94s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=361.94s)]
*  Things are certainly tense. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=362.94s)]
*  MTS, thank you very much. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAwCsuLjoo&t=363.94s)]
