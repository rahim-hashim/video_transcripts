# Biden reflects on his foreign policy accomplishments
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do)
*  And we see now the president approaching the lectern over at the State Department. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=0.0s)]
*  Good afternoon. If I didn't say anything, this would go on all afternoon for good reason. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=60.0s)]
*  Mr. President, it is an honor to welcome you back to the State Department. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=71.0s)]
*  On day one of this administration, you shared a few things with me. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=77.0s)]
*  You told me something that we long discussed reminded me that American engagement, American leadership is essential. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=84.0s)]
*  If we're not engaged, if we're not leading, you said, someone else is likely to be doing it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=94.0s)]
*  And probably not in a way that advances our interest or values. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=100.0s)]
*  Or maybe no one's doing it. And then we're likely to have a vacuum filled with bad things before it's filled with good things. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=104.0s)]
*  But the other thing you told me, Mr. President, was that there's a greater premium than ever before on finding ways to cooperate, to coordinate, to work with other countries if we're going to get done what we need to get done for the American people. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=111.0s)]
*  And so you instructed me, you instructed all of us to get out there, to rebuild, to rejuvenate, even to reimagine our alliances and partnerships. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=126.0s)]
*  And I remember what you told me then. You said, we don't know when this is going to make a difference, when we're going to need these friendships, these partnerships. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=138.0s)]
*  But someday, some way, somewhere, they're going to be critical for advancing the national interest. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=149.0s)]
*  And that's exactly what the men and women of this department have done. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=157.0s)]
*  And we've been able to carry out that charge for two reasons. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=163.0s)]
*  First, the people you see before you and so many others who are out in the field or embassies and consulates. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=167.0s)]
*  You said when you came here four years ago that the leadership of diplomats of every stripe doing the daily work of government is essential. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=175.0s)]
*  And they proved it. That daily work has become nightly work. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=184.0s)]
*  24-7, seven days a week, hammering out agreements, jumping into action in crisis, creating opportunities for our citizens around the world, producing expert advice for you and your team at the White House. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=189.0s)]
*  Everyone here knows this work can be tough. It's often not very glamorous, but it makes us stronger. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=205.0s)]
*  It makes the world a better place. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=214.0s)]
*  And we simply couldn't do it without the extraordinary men and women that you have before us, as well as our remarkable partners in government. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=217.0s)]
*  Starting with the great White House team led by Jake Sullivan, my friends and colleagues from across the administration, Secretary of Defense, Samantha Power at USAID, the Secretary of the Treasury, Commerce, and so on. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=228.0s)]
*  All of these partnerships that we built and built with their teams have made a difference. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=241.0s)]
*  So to all of my colleagues, thank you. Thank you for your friendship. Thank you for your partnership. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=247.0s)]
*  There's one other reason that we've been able to reengage and rejuvenate our diplomacy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=254.0s)]
*  Mr. President, that's you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=262.0s)]
*  You have never wavered in the conviction that when America leads, when America engages, there is little we cannot accomplish, and that this country remains a force for good, a force for progress around the world. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=264.0s)]
*  Your unshakable belief in the promise of America has inspired me for more than 20 years. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=281.0s)]
*  It's inspired so many people in this department and around the world. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=288.0s)]
*  Simply put, it's been the privilege of my lifetime to work for you, to work with you, to work with this extraordinary team that you've assembled. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=293.0s)]
*  And it's the honor of a lifetime to be able to introduce one more time the 46th President of the United States, Joe Biden. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=302.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=323.0s)]
*  It's good to be back at the State Department. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=348.0s)]
*  Tony, if I may start by saying this, you're one of the finest men I've ever known in any undertaking, for one important reason. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=351.0s)]
*  You're not only brilliant, you have incredible character. You have character. You have more integrity than almost anybody I know. Thank you for always sticking with me. Appreciate it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=369.0s)]
*  I'm grateful for his counsel and his friendship as well, but I also want to thank the members of my cabinet and the members of the Congress for here today and to all our diplomats, development experts, service members, and intelligence professionals. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=380.0s)]
*  Many of the achievements we're going to discuss today were the result of your hard work. And that's not hyperbole. It's true. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=400.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your extraordinary service. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=407.0s)]
*  I come here to the State Department to report to the American people on the progress we've made in the last four years in our foreign policy and our presidency. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=412.0s)]
*  I've said many times, we're at an inflection point. The post-Cold War period is over. A new era has begun. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=423.0s)]
*  In these four years, we faced crises that we've been tested. We've come through those tests stronger in my view than we entered those tests. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=432.0s)]
*  This is a fierce competition underway. The future of the global economy, technology, human values, and so much else. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=441.0s)]
*  Right now, in my view, thanks to our administration, the United States is winning the worldwide competition. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=450.0s)]
*  Compared to four years ago, America is stronger. Our alliances are stronger. Our adversaries and competitors are weaker. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=457.0s)]
*  We have not gone to war to make these things happen. During my presidency, I've increased America's power at every dimension. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=466.0s)]
*  We've increased our diplomatic power, creating more allies the United States has ever had in the history of our nation. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=474.0s)]
*  We've increased our military power, making the most significant investments in the defense industrial base in decades. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=481.0s)]
*  We've increased the technology power, taking the lead in artificial intelligence and other technologies of the future. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=488.0s)]
*  And we've increased the economic power, building the most dynamic economy in the world from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=494.0s)]
*  In short, Kamala and I took office, our nation had become stronger at home, are stronger in the world. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=504.0s)]
*  And now, America is more capable and I would argue better prepared than we've been in a long, long time. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=512.0s)]
*  While our competitors and adversaries are facing stiff headwinds, we have the wind at our back because of all of you. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=520.0s)]
*  This is what we're heading into. And over the next administration, that's what we're handing it to. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=527.0s)]
*  Today, I want to lay out what we've done, the opportunities we've created for America and those opportunities going forward. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=532.0s)]
*  Today, I can report to the American people, our sources of national power are far stronger than we were when we took office. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=540.0s)]
*  Our economy is booming, although there's more work to do. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=550.0s)]
*  Our technologies, from artificial intelligence to biotech, quantum to advanced semiconductors, they're the envy of the world. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=556.0s)]
*  And we have made the most significant investments in America and the American workers since the New Deal. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=564.0s)]
*  To rebuild our roads and bridges, our ports and airports, clean water systems, affordable high speed internet, and so much more. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=570.0s)]
*  To build American manufacturing, to make advanced semiconductors, which we invented here at home. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=578.0s)]
*  We made the largest investment in climate and clean energy ever anywhere on earth in the history of the world. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=586.0s)]
*  Spurring nearly $500 billion in private sector investment. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=593.0s)]
*  We've also significantly strengthened the defense industrial base, investing almost $1.3 trillion in procurement and research and development. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=599.0s)]
*  In real dollars, that's more than America did in any four-year period during the Cold War. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=609.0s)]
*  This is going to ensure that we're fully equipped to fight and win wars, which is also the best way to deter wars in the first place. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=615.0s)]
*  Today, I can report to the American people. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=625.0s)]
*  Our alliances are stronger than they've been in decades. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=629.0s)]
*  NATO is more capable than it's ever been. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=633.0s)]
*  And many more of our allies are paying their fair share. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=637.0s)]
*  Before I took office, nine NATO allies are spending 2% of their GDP on defense. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=641.0s)]
*  Now, 23 are spending 2%. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=647.0s)]
*  Look at the Indo-Pacific. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=652.0s)]
*  We've made partnerships stronger and created new partnerships to challenge China's aggressive behavior and to rebalance power in the region. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=654.0s)]
*  We did it when few thought it was possible to build the first ever trilateral partnership between the United States, Japan, and South Korea. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=664.0s)]
*  Then another among the United States, Japan, and the Philippines. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=676.0s)]
*  Drawing close to our Pacific allies is to defend our shared security and prosperity. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=681.0s)]
*  We've broken a defense pact known as AUKUS among the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific allies as only America is able to do. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=687.0s)]
*  I've taken the quad to the next level. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=701.0s)]
*  The United States, Japan, Australia, and India. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=706.0s)]
*  When we had that first meeting, I was dumbfounded when they all called and said, can we do this at your house? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=710.0s)]
*  I think I'm kidding. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=718.0s)]
*  My wife said, no problem. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=720.0s)]
*  It was during the UN meeting and we thought we were going to do it in New York, but they wanted to do it in Delaware. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=723.0s)]
*  I said, why? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=728.0s)]
*  Said, we can help them. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=730.0s)]
*  People know we're really friends. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=731.0s)]
*  Our democracy with vibrant economies working closely, security, supply chains, technology, and so much more. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=734.0s)]
*  In the Red Sea, brought together more than 20 countries to protect civilian ships from attack by the Houthis. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=744.0s)]
*  Defending freedom of navigation, one of the world's busiest waterways. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=754.0s)]
*  And we have strengthened partnerships all across the Americas, defending democracy, targeting corruption, addressing migration, increasing prosperity, and protecting Amazon rainforest, which captures billions of tons, billions of tons of carbon from the atmosphere every year. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=760.0s)]
*  Overall, we've reinvigorated people's faith in the United States as a true, true partner. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=779.0s)]
*  Today, I can report to the American people. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=786.0s)]
*  Our adversaries are weaker than where we came into this job four years ago. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=789.0s)]
*  Just consider Russia. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=794.0s)]
*  When Putin invaded Ukraine, he thought he'd conquer Kiev in a matter of days. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=796.0s)]
*  The truth is, since that war began, I'm the only one that stood in the center of Kiev, not him. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=802.0s)]
*  Putin never has. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=808.0s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=810.0s)]
*  It was a long train ride, but I'm the only commander-in-chief to visit a war zone not controlled by U.S. forces. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=820.0s)]
*  We helped Ukrainians stop Putin. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=826.0s)]
*  And now, nearly three years later, Putin has failed to achieve any of his strategic objectives. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=829.0s)]
*  He has failed thus far to subjugate Ukraine, failed to break the unity of NATO, and failed to make large territorial gains. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=835.0s)]
*  There's more to do. We can't walk away. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=845.0s)]
*  We rallied 50 nations to stand with Ukraine, not just in Europe, but for the first time in Asia as well. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=848.0s)]
*  Those countries in Asia know what happens in Ukraine matters to them as well. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=856.0s)]
*  We delivered air interceptors, massive numbers of munitions, enacted relentless unprecedented sanctions to keep Ukraine in the fight. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=863.0s)]
*  And now Russia is struggling to replace what they are losing on the battlefield in terms of military equipment and fighters. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=874.0s)]
*  And the ruble is under enormous pressure. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=883.0s)]
*  As I saw it, when Putin launched his invasion, I had two jobs. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=887.0s)]
*  One to rally the world to defend Ukraine, and the other is to avoid war between two nuclear powers. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=893.0s)]
*  We did both those things. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=901.0s)]
*  Today, Ukraine is still a free, independent country with the potential, the potential for a bright future. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=903.0s)]
*  And we laid the foundation for the next administration so they can protect the bright future of the Ukrainian people. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=913.0s)]
*  And now look at Iran. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=921.0s)]
*  Did you ever think we'd be where we are with Iran at this moment? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=924.0s)]
*  After those despicable attacks by Hamas on October the 7th, Iran directly attacked Israel twice with hundreds of ballistic missiles and drones. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=928.0s)]
*  And twice they failed because the United States organized a coalition of countries to stop them and order U.S. aircraft to come to the defense of Israel. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=939.0s)]
*  Now Iran's air defenses are in shambles. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=950.0s)]
*  The main proxy, Hezbollah, is badly wounded. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=955.0s)]
*  And as we tested Iran's willingness to revive the nuclear deal, we kept the pressure with sanctions. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=959.0s)]
*  Now Iran's economy is in desperate straits. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=967.0s)]
*  All told, Iran is weaker than it's been in decades. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=970.0s)]
*  And if you want more evidence of how it has seriously weakened Iran and Russia, just take a look at Syria. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=975.0s)]
*  President Assad was both countries' closest ally in the Middle East. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=982.0s)]
*  Neither, neither could keep him in power. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=987.0s)]
*  Quite frankly, neither really tried very hard. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=991.0s)]
*  Now, I cannot claim credit for every factor that led to Iran and Russia growing weaker in the past four years. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=994.0s)]
*  They did plenty of damage all by themselves. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1002.0s)]
*  But Israel did plenty of damage to Iran and its proxies. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1006.0s)]
*  But there's no question our actions contributed significantly. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1010.0s)]
*  And now major authoritarian states are aligning more closely with one another. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1015.0s)]
*  Iran, Russia, China, North Korea. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1021.0s)]
*  But that's more out of weakness than out of strength. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1026.0s)]
*  So as the new administration begins, the United States is in a fundamentally stronger position with respect to these countries than we were four years ago. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1030.0s)]
*  Today, I can report to the American people, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1041.0s)]
*  We're in a better strategic position in the long term competition with China than we were when I took office. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1046.0s)]
*  You all recall many experts believe or predicting it was inevitable that China's economy would surpass ours. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1053.0s)]
*  According to many predictions, that would happen by the year 2030 or shortly thereafter. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1062.0s)]
*  But we in this room said no. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1067.0s)]
*  We make the investments in ourselves. We protect our workers and technology. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1071.0s)]
*  That will not happen. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1075.0s)]
*  Now, according to the latest predictions on China's current course, they will never surpass us. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1078.0s)]
*  Period. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1084.0s)]
*  I met one on one with President Xi in consequential summits. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1086.0s)]
*  He and I have always been direct and straightforward of each other. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1091.0s)]
*  I made it clear we expect China and everyone to abide by the international rules. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1094.0s)]
*  And so we stood up against unfair trade practices, taking action when China dumps subsidized goods, incredibly subsidized on our marks to undercut our workers. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1101.0s)]
*  We impose target tariffs on critical sectors like cars, steel and semiconductors rather than across the board tariffs. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1112.0s)]
*  We imposed historic export controls on investments restrictions to ensure that China cannot cannot use the most advanced technology and sensitive data sensitive data against us. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1122.0s)]
*  Critically, we listed our allies and partners to join us. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1136.0s)]
*  Building more convergence among our allies on a shared approach to China than ever existed. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1141.0s)]
*  And showing that it's more effective to deal with China alongside of partners rather than going to alone. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1149.0s)]
*  But even while we compete vigorously, we've managed our relationship with China responsibly. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1157.0s)]
*  So it's never tipped over into conflict. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1164.0s)]
*  We've created lines of communication between President Xi and myself and between the leaders of our militaries to avoid misunderstanding. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1167.0s)]
*  We found ways to work with each other to address climate change, to reduce the flow of fentanyl in the United States, which, by the way, overdose overdose deaths are coming down across our nation. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1176.0s)]
*  And in my administration, we've seized more fentanyl at our border in two years than the previous five years combined. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1191.0s)]
*  Today, I can also report to the American people for the first president in decades who's not leaving a war in Afghanistan to his successor. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1199.0s)]
*  But we've got bin Laden during the Obama Biden administration. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1211.0s)]
*  The primary objective of war had been accomplished. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1214.0s)]
*  And I believe that going forward, the primary threat of al Qaeda would no longer be emanating from Afghanistan, but from elsewhere. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1217.0s)]
*  And so we not need to station sizable number of American forces in Afghanistan. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1226.0s)]
*  So when I took office, I had a choice. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1233.0s)]
*  Only I saw no reason to keep thousands of servicemen in Afghanistan. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1236.0s)]
*  I think I have my schedule with me and I keep on my I don't hear it. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1241.0s)]
*  Don't it? But I keep on the back of my card. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1245.0s)]
*  The actual number of dead and wounded occurred in our longest war to remind myself. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1248.0s)]
*  Keep spending hundreds of millions of dollars a day. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1254.0s)]
*  We no longer doing that. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1257.0s)]
*  In my view, it was time to end the war and bring our troops home. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1259.0s)]
*  And we did. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1264.0s)]
*  I commend the courage of all those who served in Afghanistan. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1266.0s)]
*  We grieve all 2461 Americans made the ultimate sacrifice in the longest war in American history. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1269.0s)]
*  And I grieve those brave service members who lives were lost during the withdrawal. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1277.0s)]
*  We also thank those inside and outside of government have done so much to help thousands of Afghan families resettled in the United States. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1283.0s)]
*  Remember, critics said if we entered the war, it would damage our alliances and create threats to our homeland from foreign direct to terrorism out of a safe haven in Afghanistan. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1292.0s)]
*  Neither has occurred. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1304.0s)]
*  Neither has occurred. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1307.0s)]
*  Our alliance to stay strong. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1310.0s)]
*  We've used our over the rise and capabilities to strike in Afghanistan and elsewhere when we had to, for instance, eliminating Zawahiri leader of Al Qaeda. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1313.0s)]
*  Well, pork is a September 11th attack. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1322.0s)]
*  And we did it without putting more American boots on the ground. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1325.0s)]
*  And by ending the war, we've been able to focus our energy and resources on more urgent challenges. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1329.0s)]
*  There is nothing I can tell you my conversation about Xi and Putin, nothing our adversaries and competitors like Russia and China would have liked more than seeing us to continue to be tied down in Afghanistan for another decade. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1336.0s)]
*  For all those reasons, ending the war was the right thing to do. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1351.0s)]
*  And I believe history will reflect that. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1356.0s)]
*  And from the moment I entered office, I also worked to free as many Americans as possible being held hostage, wrongfully detained overseas. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1359.0s)]
*  We brought home more than 75 Americans by last count. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1368.0s)]
*  And some cases it took months, even years of effort. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1373.0s)]
*  Like the prisoner swap with Russia over the past summer. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1377.0s)]
*  Featuring diplomacy involving all many of you and involving multiple countries who joined complex negotiations at our request. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1380.0s)]
*  Another example of the power of our alliances. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1391.0s)]
*  We did not have these relationships. Those women and women would likely still be in prison. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1395.0s)]
*  And finally, I can report to the American people who restored our leadership in a range of other generational priorities. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1400.0s)]
*  When I took office, we were no longer part of the international climate agreement. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1409.0s)]
*  We announced on day one that we would join the Paris Accord, rejoin. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1414.0s)]
*  And we were led by example. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1420.0s)]
*  We've conserved hundreds of millions of acres, hundreds of millions of acres of land and water, more than any president in American history. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1423.0s)]
*  Making investments in clean energy and convincing other nations to join us. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1432.0s)]
*  Thanks to our efforts, the world has reached the goal of investing $100 billion every year in public and private funds to reduce greenhouse emissions, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1437.0s)]
*  to drive down the cost of clean energy, to help developing nations adapt to climate change. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1448.0s)]
*  Our administration has launched a transformative initiative to build high impact infrastructure to developing nations. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1454.0s)]
*  It's called PGI. You all know that better than anyone. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1462.0s)]
*  This is our alternative to what China offers with its massive projects across Africa and beyond. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1466.0s)]
*  But their approach features no workers' rights, no environmental protections, unmanageable debt, shoddy construction, all in exchange for military access to ports and other exploitive purposes. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1474.0s)]
*  By contrast, we've leveraged $600 billion to unleash the private sector to build an infrastructure in order to grow economies and combat climate change. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1491.0s)]
*  As an example, I was recently in Angola to see a major project being built with the help of American public funding, which brought in even more private investment. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1503.0s)]
*  We're building the first ever transcontinental railroad across Africa. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1515.0s)]
*  Most significantly improved of the economies of the region will help farmers transport crops in new global markets, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1520.0s)]
*  transport critical minerals that are needed for electric vehicles and semiconductors. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1528.0s)]
*  China used to control the supply chains in these materials, but not for long. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1536.0s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, there are serious challenges the United States must continue to deal with in Ukraine, in the Middle East, in the Indo-Pacific. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1543.0s)]
*  It must keep the pressure on the Houthis, who are attacking ships in the Red Sea, launching missiles at Israel, and firing at American forces. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1552.0s)]
*  It must deter North Korea as they rattle their saber and draw closer to Russia. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1563.0s)]
*  And new challenges will certainly emerge in the months and years ahead. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1569.0s)]
*  But even so, it's clear my administration is leaving the next administration with a very strong hand to play. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1573.0s)]
*  And we're leaving them and America with more friends and stronger alliances, whose adversaries are weaker and under pressure. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1582.0s)]
*  An America that once again is leading, uniting countries, setting the agenda, bringing others together behind our plans and visions. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1592.0s)]
*  An America which is no longer at war, which has made historic investments in American workers, American energies, and many American factories, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1604.0s)]
*  generating the strongest economy in the world, which is now in a much better position to win the future against any competitor. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1615.0s)]
*  These wins are not partisan. They're American. They benefit all Americans and reflect America's endless capacity for leadership and reinvention. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1623.0s)]
*  Look, folks, the United States should take full advantage of our diplomatic and geopolitical opportunities we've created. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1636.0s)]
*  To keep bringing countries together to deal with challenges posed by China, to make sure Putin's war ends and adjusts to the lasting peace for Ukraine, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1643.0s)]
*  and to capitalize on a new moment for a more stable, integrated Middle East. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1655.0s)]
*  To do that, the next administration must make sure the fall of Assad does not lead to the resurgence of ISIS in Syria and across the region. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1663.0s)]
*  It must carry forward the commitment that America will never, never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1674.0s)]
*  And the war between Israel and Hamas were in the brink of a proposal that I laid out in detail months ago, finally coming to fruition. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1683.0s)]
*  I have learned in many years of public service to never, never, never, ever give up. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1696.0s)]
*  So I spoke to Prime Minister Vigil yesterday. I spoke to Amir Kudry today. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1706.0s)]
*  I look forward to speaking with President Sisi soon. We're pressing hard to close this. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1712.0s)]
*  The deal we have in structure would free the hostages, halt the fighting, provide security to Israel, and allow us to significantly surge humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians who have suffered terribly in this war that Hamas started. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1719.0s)]
*  They've been through hell. So many innocent people have been killed. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1736.0s)]
*  Many communities have been destroyed. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1741.0s)]
*  The Palestinian people deserve peace and the right to determine their own futures. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1744.0s)]
*  Israel deserves peace and real security. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1750.0s)]
*  And the hostages and their families deserve to be reunited. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1754.0s)]
*  And so we're working urgently to close this deal. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1759.0s)]
*  And as we deal with immediate challenges, in my view, we have to look to the future. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1763.0s)]
*  I urge the next administration to carry forward two issues that have been central to my presidency and would shape the future, in my view. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1770.0s)]
*  On artificial intelligence, we are in the lead and we must stay in the lead. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1780.0s)]
*  We must not offshore artificial intelligence, as we once did with computer chips and other critical technologies. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1787.0s)]
*  AI has the power to reshape economies, governments, national security, entire societies. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1796.0s)]
*  And it must be the United States and our closest allies that lead the way to ensure people's rights are respected, their safety is protected, and their data is secure. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1805.0s)]
*  Likewise, clean energy transition will race ahead in years to come. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1818.0s)]
*  I know some incoming administration, some in the incoming administration, are skeptical about the need for clean energy. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1825.0s)]
*  They don't even believe climate change is real. I think they come from a different century. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1835.0s)]
*  They're wrong. They are dead wrong. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1841.0s)]
*  It's the single greatest existential threat to humanity. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1846.0s)]
*  The clean energy transition is already happening. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1850.0s)]
*  China is trying to dominate the clean energy manufacturing critical materials supply chains. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1854.0s)]
*  They want to capture the market of the future and create new dependencies. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1862.0s)]
*  The United States must win that contest. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1866.0s)]
*  We will shape the global economy on the planet for decades to come. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1869.0s)]
*  Let me close with this. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1874.0s)]
*  Like many of you, I've dedicated a significant portion of my career to our nation's foreign policy. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1877.0s)]
*  As chair of the Foreign Relations Committee as a senator, vice president for eight years, and now president of the United States, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1883.0s)]
*  I put together one of the most competent foreign policy teams, I would argue, in American history sitting in this room and before my eyes. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1893.0s)]
*  Throughout my career, the world has undergone tremendous change. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1901.0s)]
*  But certain things have always held true. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1907.0s)]
*  At our best, America leads not only by the example of our power, but the power of our example. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1911.0s)]
*  The past four years, we've used that power not to go it alone, but instead to bring countries together. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1920.0s)]
*  To increase shared security and prosperity. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1928.0s)]
*  To stand up to aggression. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1933.0s)]
*  To solve problems through diplomacy, wherever possible. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1936.0s)]
*  And to relentlessly defend democracy, civil rights, and human rights. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1941.0s)]
*  Because that's who we are. That's who we are. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1947.0s)]
*  You heard me say it many times before. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1952.0s)]
*  We're the only country on earth founded on idea. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1955.0s)]
*  Every other country is founded on geography, religion, ethnicity, or some other unifying factor. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1960.0s)]
*  But America was built on idea. On an idea. Literally, not figuratively. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1967.0s)]
*  That idea was all women amount are created equal. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1972.0s)]
*  The idea that has inspired the world for 250 years and counting. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1976.0s)]
*  We're always reaching to do better. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1982.0s)]
*  Always looking to the future. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1985.0s)]
*  Not our best. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1988.0s)]
*  Always seeking progress for our people and for people everywhere. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1990.0s)]
*  It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1995.0s)]
*  Today, I'm optimistic about our future as optimistic as I've ever been. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=1999.0s)]
*  You just have to remember who in the hell we are. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2003.0s)]
*  You've heard me say it many times. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2006.0s)]
*  We're the United States of America, for God's sake. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2008.0s)]
*  There is nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2011.0s)]
*  If we do it together and commit to it. Nothing. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2015.0s)]
*  So thank you all for all you've done. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2019.0s)]
*  I hope many of you are going to be staying in the next administration to keep this moving. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2022.0s)]
*  May God bless you all. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2029.0s)]
*  And may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2031.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2035.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2037.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2039.0s)]
*  We have been watching President Biden speak at the State Department in his final foreign policy speech. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2053.0s)]
*  He thanked all of our diplomats and service members for their extraordinary service. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2059.0s)]
*  The president says the U.S. is stronger after his presidency and our adversaries are weaker. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2063.0s)]
*  Topics range from artificial intelligence to foreign wars to clean energy and climate change. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2068.0s)]
*  Let's go to CBS News senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe who joins us now. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2074.0s)]
*  Ed, like always, you were spot on in your preview of what we were expecting to hear. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2079.0s)]
*  What stood out to you about some of the top lines? We know it was very wide ranging. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2083.0s)]
*  I think that he said that a lot of this can be inherited and continued by the Trump administration if they just so choose to continue it. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2087.0s)]
*  And those warnings about artificial intelligence and the threats of climate change. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2097.0s)]
*  That was echoed earlier today by his national security adviser Jake Sullivan in the daily briefing when he was asked, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2102.0s)]
*  what do you think is the biggest challenge sort of left unresolved or that remains out there for the next administration? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2108.0s)]
*  I think that the question is whether artificial intelligence and whether it will be used for good or for bad. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2114.0s)]
*  You heard the president there suggest that while the United States has the edge, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2119.0s)]
*  it has to maintain that and has to be using it responsibly for the greater good. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2122.0s)]
*  But a pretty vociferous defense and detailed at times about elements of the work that he's done, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2127.0s)]
*  making the case that by buoying NATO, by expanding partnerships in the Indo-Pacific, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2133.0s)]
*  by working to weaken Russia's military and Iran's influence across the Middle East, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2138.0s)]
*  his has been a successful foreign policy and administration. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2142.0s)]
*  Notable that he signals there that we are pretty close, it sounds like, to some kind of an agreement between Israel and Hamas. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2146.0s)]
*  Now how many times have we heard that over the last 15 plus months? We have heard it several times. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2152.0s)]
*  But what's different in the last few days is that the leaders are now talking to each other. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2158.0s)]
*  The president and the prime minister speaking yesterday for the first time that we know of, at least publicly, since October. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2162.0s)]
*  The fact that the Israelis sent a delegation to Qatar to work on some of the final details of the agreement [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2167.0s)]
*  and that a final draft has been sent to Hamas leadership leaves this White House quite optimistic [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2174.0s)]
*  that we may be on the verge of some kind of an agreement between Hamas and Israel [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2178.0s)]
*  and the president encouraging everyone there to get it done, noting that it would help secure Israel, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2183.0s)]
*  it would help work the Palestinian people closer to peace and their own security [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2188.0s)]
*  and try to resolve what has been a real mark on his administration, at least over the last 15, 16 months or so. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2193.0s)]
*  But a pretty receptive audience as he continues to work the room and speak with State Department officials. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2200.0s)]
*  There were a handful of lawmakers, there are other cabinet secretaries over at the State Department, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2205.0s)]
*  a place he'd been and knows well having served once as the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2209.0s)]
*  He had direct oversight of what goes on in that building. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2215.0s)]
*  And then of course as president he has had a keen interest in what exactly those diplomats have been up to. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2218.0s)]
*  So a pretty full-throated defense, a lot of it could be picked apart of course. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2224.0s)]
*  And of course this talk about expanding NATO, for example, some could argue it wouldn't have needed to expand it [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2229.0s)]
*  and there wouldn't have been a rush to join it had he been able to convince Vladimir Putin not to invade Ukraine in the first place, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2236.0s)]
*  but spinning that situation into a positive by suggesting it's bolstered NATO, more members are paying into it, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2244.0s)]
*  more money than they ever have before, which you'll recall was a big concern and request of then President Trump back in the day. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2251.0s)]
*  He sees that as a win and his final days here will continue with other appearances throughout the rest of the week, Lindsay. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2257.0s)]
*  Ed, stay with us if you can. I want to bring in a military analyst major, Mike Lyons. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2265.0s)]
*  Major, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2269.0s)]
*  I want to ask you your thoughts as well and if there was anything what Ed said that you wanted to piggyback off of. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2272.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wasn't surprised. He doubled down, tripled down on a lot of things and the platitudes they gave himself as administration. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2278.0s)]
*  But in a lot of ways, foreign policy is a function of what happens over the horizon as he turns over this country to new president, a new administration. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2284.0s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of changes with regard how things are running. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2293.0s)]
*  I think the overall, the Biden foreign policy wasn't bad. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2297.0s)]
*  I think that it made strides, for example, in the Far East with Korea and with Japan in certain ways there and as he brought up in this comments, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2301.0s)]
*  I think the situation in Ukraine is very critical right now. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2311.0s)]
*  And the fact that he set this up, that if the Trump administration doesn't support Ukraine, doesn't send the kind of billions of dollars that this administration has been sending him, that Ukraine loses this war in 12 to 18 months. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2314.0s)]
*  And I think that's a catastrophe. So he's kind of laid the groundwork for the Trump administration to be not successful based on what he knows that they're going to do as well, which he doesn't believe that they're going to support it. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2326.0s)]
*  I think the situation in the Middle East again remains very tenuous. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2338.0s)]
*  You have the Iranians, they're surely weak. And whether the question is whether Israel goes after the Iranian nuclear capability, he did say in the speech that he didn't think Iran should ever have this capability. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2343.0s)]
*  But there are most people are convinced in the world that it's not going to be negotiated away. It's going to take a military strike. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2353.0s)]
*  But but overall, I wasn't surprised. He did talk about Afghanistan. I think that's a sore point. I do think that it's a positive that we're out of Afghanistan. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2358.0s)]
*  I think the point was how we left was what most people are concerned about and and those family members of those service members that were killed there. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2365.0s)]
*  And that was unnecessary. But but overall, it wasn't surprising what what the president said today and how he felt his administration did in foreign policy perspective. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2373.0s)]
*  And we will talk more about Afghanistan with Ed, because he did ask Jake Sullivan about that today. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2382.0s)]
*  When it comes to Ukraine, one of President Biden's most forceful comments that he made today was when Putin invaded Ukraine, he thought he conquered Kiev in a matter of days. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2386.0s)]
*  I'm the only one standing in the center of Kiev. Do you think, Mike, in addition to what Ed was saying that he was saying that this could be continued on if the Trump administration deems so, he was also trying to highlight the differences in his platform and what he believes he accomplished over the last four years and what Trump ran on, which is more of an American first mentality. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2393.0s)]
*  No, I think so. I don't think there's anything wrong with an American first mentality. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2412.0s)]
*  I think it communicates intent. And I think our allies want America to act first in foreign policy because it helps them as long as it's communicated. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2415.0s)]
*  But when you bring this back to Ukraine, they only survive with the support from the United States and the NATO countries there. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2423.0s)]
*  And that's what the concern I think President Biden has is that President Trump said that wouldn't happen. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2428.0s)]
*  And I think President Trump a few months ago was more of a strong arm. He can negotiate with Putin. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2433.0s)]
*  He was going to get this done. But I think the last few months, Putin has signaled that he's not willing to negotiate. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2439.0s)]
*  He wants the whole thing. He's not willing to lose on any level. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2444.0s)]
*  And I think this is going to be a very tough problem set for this incoming administration and forcing Ukraine to take less, forcing Ukraine to lose their land areas that Russia had controls or doesn't get the security commitments that it wants. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2448.0s)]
*  I think that's going to look like Russia has won. So and if the world allows Russia to win here, then what have we gotten the last three years? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2462.0s)]
*  We haven't we haven't moved that forward. So I do think that the Trump administration will be somewhat forced to keep this going because Russia is not that weak. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2470.0s)]
*  They're not as they could still win in 12 to 18 months based on what their capability is and based on the fact that if Americans and America, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2478.0s)]
*  as well as other NATO countries, don't support the situation there, Ukraine would be in big trouble. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2487.0s)]
*  So I want to ask a little bit about that because I had Ian Bremer from the Eurasian Group on last week about what they deem the greatest global risks are in 2025. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2491.0s)]
*  And it sort of is in line with what Secretary of State Blinken was saying. According to the Eurasian Group, one of the biggest concerns, if not the biggest, is a vacuum at the forefront of global politics. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2500.0s)]
*  Secretary Blinken said today that one of the first things that Biden told him in his presidency was if we aren't leading someone else is and not in a way that advances our values. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2510.0s)]
*  Or if no one is leading, then we are in a vacuum. Do you share any of those concerns moving forward into the next administration? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2519.0s)]
*  I think this next administration is going to put forward a much greater signal of deterrence that this last one didn't. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2526.0s)]
*  For example, we just really downward managed the conflict in Ukraine. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2534.0s)]
*  We whipsawed back and forth with support for Israel, frankly, in terms of we gave them the military support that they needed. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2539.0s)]
*  What does downward managed mean? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2546.0s)]
*  Well, we didn't necessarily. We're supporting Ukraine in a way that just keeps them from losing. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2549.0s)]
*  We've not given them the offensive capability that allows them to go win and actually bring Russia to the negotiation table. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2556.0s)]
*  So we've just managed the decline and the defense inside. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2563.0s)]
*  Any person in the military knows nothing changes unless you go on the offense. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2567.0s)]
*  Look at Desert Storm in 1991. We defended for a while and said, you know what, the only way things change is when we go on the offense. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2571.0s)]
*  And so we haven't given them that that full throated kind of support in Ukraine to go on the offense. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2578.0s)]
*  We've just in the last few months allowed Ukraine to use military Western assets to attack inside of Russia. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2583.0s)]
*  But isn't a Ukraine considered more tenuous under a Trump administration? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2590.0s)]
*  We don't know the kind of funding or they're going to be giving to Ukraine. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2593.0s)]
*  No question. I think that the Trump administration could shut a lot of that aid down. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2597.0s)]
*  And that aid is not cash. I don't want people to think that we're writing checks to oligarchs or anything like that there. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2602.0s)]
*  And what they've done is they've opened up the factories and they've opened up military supplies and artillery weapons and the like. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2607.0s)]
*  They've really given Ukraine all it can get there. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2615.0s)]
*  This is still a logistical challenge of getting it there and all the things that go with that. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2619.0s)]
*  But it also still not just right. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2622.0s)]
*  Writing a check doesn't necessarily mean Ukraine is going to be able to win. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2624.0s)]
*  They still need to change some of their tactics. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2628.0s)]
*  They still need to have different material and they have a recruiting problem themselves. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2631.0s)]
*  So again, the situation there is potentially catastrophic for the Trump administration if they don't manage it well and figure out a way to get Russia to the table without in a manner that also Russia doesn't think that they can attack their their neighbors and change the world order. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2635.0s)]
*  Major Alliance will have to leave it there for today, but I've really enjoyed our conversation. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2651.0s)]
*  I look forward to many more with you. Thank you so much. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2654.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2657.0s)]
*  Let's go back to Ed O'Keefe now at the White House. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2658.0s)]
*  So, Ed, I know that you had an exchange today in the briefing room with Jake Sullivan. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2660.0s)]
*  Let's go ahead and play that. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2664.0s)]
*  Historians one day will write the history of the Biden policy and I end up summarizing it in two to three sentences. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2668.0s)]
*  How would you write those two to three sentences? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2676.0s)]
*  I would say that we made our alliances stronger. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2678.0s)]
*  We made our enemies weaker. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2681.0s)]
*  We made America's sources of strength stronger and we did all of that while keeping America out of war. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2683.0s)]
*  And I didn't hear you mention Afghanistan in your opening at all. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2688.0s)]
*  How is that going to be addressed in the speech? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2693.0s)]
*  How would he explain or defend it? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2694.0s)]
*  He will address Afghanistan in the speech and it was in a sense reference because I said we kept America out of war. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2696.0s)]
*  In fact, President Biden ended America's longest war after 20 years. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2702.0s)]
*  This was obviously the national security adviser prior to the speech. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2706.0s)]
*  But, Ed, what did we hear from the president regarding Afghanistan, which we just heard from major alliance was a sore spot for the administration. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2710.0s)]
*  He made the argument again, Lindsay, that he had made at the time of the decision being announced, which was if we pull out of this war that has bedeviled now five presidents, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2718.0s)]
*  it will allow us to refocus and re-center our priorities on other parts of the world. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2728.0s)]
*  Yes, it did allow that, but it did that in part because a vacuum was created and the argument was, of course, that Russia filled it by invading Ukraine [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2733.0s)]
*  and drawing us into that part of the world in that conflict instead of putting more resources and attention into the Indo-Pacific relationship, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2741.0s)]
*  which he spent a fair amount of time on, but probably in hindsight would have liked to have spent more time countering China, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2748.0s)]
*  working with those other democracies there in the Indo-Pacific and in Eastern Asia. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2754.0s)]
*  And so, again, it wasn't a big part of the speech, but felt the need, obviously, to explain and defend that decision again, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2759.0s)]
*  which, remember, was supported by a majority of Americans ending the war in Afghanistan. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2766.0s)]
*  What caused a big downturn in his popularity, raised questions about his management and his competency, his ability to lead and to deal with foreign crises, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2771.0s)]
*  was the botched withdrawal, the chaos that ensued, and, of course, the 13 dead U.S. service members [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2780.0s)]
*  and all the other chaos that was seen as people were evacuated and what was still the largest successful military airlift of civilians out of any country [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2787.0s)]
*  and done so relatively safely. So, you know, they felt the need to address it. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2796.0s)]
*  It obviously wasn't a big deal because it was a real sour turning point in that first year of the presidency [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2801.0s)]
*  that, of course, came around the same time as concerns about inflation were picking up [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2806.0s)]
*  and early concerns about his ability to even do the job with signs that age perhaps was beginning to set in. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2811.0s)]
*  And so, you know, 2021, we can remember, was a really tough time and a tough turn that late summer into the fall, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2817.0s)]
*  which began with Afghanistan. That's why you heard so much focus instead today on things that came after that, Ukraine, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2824.0s)]
*  the situation in the Middle East, the expansion of NATO, the expansion of Indo-Pacific partnerships, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2829.0s)]
*  and his concerns going into the future about artificial intelligence and climate change. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2834.0s)]
*  Okay. Ed O'Keefe, always good to hear from you. Thank you. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsQvV_I5Do&t=2839.0s)]
