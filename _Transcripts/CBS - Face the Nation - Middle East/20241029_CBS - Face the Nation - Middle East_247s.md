# Why these voters are not supporting Harris after supporting Biden in 2020
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM)
*  Vice President Kamala Harris is struggling to gain the support from some Arab American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=0.0s)]
*  voters in the Battlegrounds state of Michigan. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=5.84s)]
*  Many have expressed frustration over how the Biden administration has handled the war in [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=8.0s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=11.64s)]
*  Our Ed O'Keefe spoke with members of the Arab and Muslim community there. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=12.64s)]
*  Here in Michigan and across the country, concerns with the economy, inflation, access to abortion [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=15.88s)]
*  rights and the future of democracy, obviously top of mind concerns. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=21.36s)]
*  But in this state, there's a specific group of people concerned about a far more urgent [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=25.16s)]
*  life or death issue, the war in the Middle East. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=29.5s)]
*  There are hundreds of thousands of Arab or Muslim American voters in this state who live [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=32.18s)]
*  mostly in and around Dearborn and Detroit. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=37.22s)]
*  And we spent some time with some of them recently who are quite upset about what's going on [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=39.94s)]
*  in the Middle East, quite upset with Vice President Harris for her support of Israel [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=45.5s)]
*  and personally affected by the violence. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=49.42s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=52.58s)]
*  Who here knows someone who has been killed in the last year in Gaza or Lebanon? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=54.46s)]
*  And who here has a neighbor or friend who's had relatives killed in Gaza or Lebanon? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=62.54s)]
*  I don't think people understand how dehumanizing and demoralizing this experience has been [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=69.78s)]
*  for us and that we're expected to be these upstanding, healthy, productive members of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=74.66s)]
*  we are gladly, but you can expect us to continue down that trajectory and expect us to be healthy [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=80.98s)]
*  functioning members of this country while you utilize our tax dollars to destabilize [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=86.66s)]
*  our homelands and murder our family members. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=91.26s)]
*  And I don't think that people understand how much that greatly affects the way that we [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=95.54s)]
*  vote. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=101.26s)]
*  Have any of you been contacted by her campaign either with a text or a door knock or an email? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=102.26s)]
*  Every 15 minutes. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=108.38s)]
*  Do you text back, stop? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=111.38s)]
*  No, I don't text back, stop. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=112.38s)]
*  I just ask them, can you please clarify Kamala Harris's? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=113.89999999999999s)]
*  Every single text I get, I reply with, can you please clarify Kamala Harris's stance [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  on the genocide taking place in the Middle East? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=122.06s)]
*  I don't get a reply back, but that's my reply to every single text I get. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=124.14s)]
*  How about you? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=127.41999999999999s)]
*  No, I've not received anything. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=128.42s)]
*  How about you? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=130.5s)]
*  You must. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=131.9s)]
*  Yeah, I've received texts as well. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=132.9s)]
*  I always respond and like was saying, I never get a response. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=136.45999999999998s)]
*  Of those four voters we spoke to, they told us they voted for President Biden four years [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=140.1s)]
*  ago. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=144.66s)]
*  None of them is planning to vote for Vice President Harris because they say her support [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=145.66s)]
*  for this war for genocide is reason enough to not support her. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=149.73999999999998s)]
*  The Harris campaign knows they have a real political problem here, quite a cute one in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=154.62s)]
*  a community where a few hundred thousand votes helped President Biden win four years ago [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=158.85999999999999s)]
*  and there are hundreds of thousands of votes potentially being withheld or being cast [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=164.54s)]
*  for a third party candidate. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=168.34s)]
*  We spoke with a Harris campaign surrogate here in the Dearborn and Detroit area who [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=169.85999999999999s)]
*  shared how it is he's trying to convince them to vote otherwise. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  I was one of the uncommitted for Joe Biden. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=179.29999999999998s)]
*  In the minute they made the transition when Joe Biden stepped down and Kamala Harris stepped [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=182.38s)]
*  up, I pivoted and I put my support behind Kamala Harris. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=188.18s)]
*  That was a pivotal moment because we're going to have a different president come January [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=193.62s)]
*  and it's not going to be Joe Biden and it could be Donald Trump again or it could be [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=200.9s)]
*  a new president and Kamala Harris. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=206.22000000000003s)]
*  And I believe that this was a pivotal moment to shift and it's a new opportunity to give [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=208.96s)]
*  us hope for something different than what we're dealing with right now. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=214.56s)]
*  Yes, it was a critical moment and that's why I put my full support behind Kamala Harris. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=218.85999999999999s)]
*  So while there's a lot of focus here in Michigan on the economy, inflation, access to abortion [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=225.28s)]
*  and other top of mind concerns, a reminder that there is a very specific group of people [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=230.24s)]
*  here quite concerned with what's going on with the war in the Middle East and for them [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=235.04s)]
*  it's been a matter of life or death and a big reason why they won't be voting for Vice [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=239.36s)]
*  President Harris. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=243.52s)]
*  Lindsay? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=244.52s)]
*  Ed O'Keefe, thank you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKXQZvTbMM&t=245.52s)]
