# Iran launches missiles toward Israel in response to massive Israeli operation
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ)
*  This is a CBS News special report on John Dickerson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Breaking news from the Middle East. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=3.4s)]
*  Iran has launched missiles towards Israel. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=4.96s)]
*  Iranian state television says, quote, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  hundreds of ballistic missiles have been deployed. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  We've seen explosions all over Tel Aviv, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=13.4s)]
*  and air raid sirens are going off across Israel. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=16.8s)]
*  And the Israeli defense forces say all of Israel [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=20.8s)]
*  is under fire as Iran fires projectiles. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=23.68s)]
*  This is in retaliation from last night's attack, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=28.16s)]
*  really waves of attacks that have targeted nuclear sites [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=30.76s)]
*  and Iran's military leadership. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=34.52s)]
*  In a televised address, Iran's supreme leader vowed revenge. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=36.76s)]
*  Let's turn to Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=42.68s)]
*  Margaret, good to be with you again. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=45.8s)]
*  Update us really on where we are right now [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=49.2s)]
*  and what your sources are telling you. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, John, we are all watching the state TV broadcast [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=54.96s)]
*  out of Iran as the supreme leader, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=58.92s)]
*  the 85-year-old man who leads the Iranian regime, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=60.68s)]
*  vowed retaliation, and it appears that's part [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=66.08s)]
*  of what we're seeing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  Those plumes of smoke you're seeing over the city [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  of Tel Aviv right now, it's not clear how many [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=73.04s)]
*  of the incoming projectiles, the missiles, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=76.56s)]
*  may have been intercepted by that U.S.-provided [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=78.8s)]
*  or how many may have made impact. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=82.16s)]
*  It is usually a very strong system that U.S. taxpayers [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  have helped to provide the state of Israel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=89.96s)]
*  What we know is that the IDF also announced [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=92.64s)]
*  that it had just carried out yet another round of attacks [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=95.64s)]
*  in Tehran and in other parts of Iran. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=99.28s)]
*  The fighter jets, according to the IDF, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=103.6s)]
*  struck another nuclear site in the Isfahan area of Iran. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=106.24s)]
*  They claim that this was a precision strike [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=111.28s)]
*  in an area where there was enriched uranium [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=114.48s)]
*  and that there was a nuclear weapons production process. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=118.08s)]
*  Now, that is a difference between Israel's intelligence [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=121.92s)]
*  and what the United States says. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  The United States intelligence community says [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=126.4s)]
*  that Iran does not have a nuclear weapons program, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  but that it does have a nuclear enrichment program. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=132.32s)]
*  That is a difference here in what the U.S. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=134.96s)]
*  and Israel are thinking, and we are continuing [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=137.4s)]
*  to try to report out how aligned the two allies [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=140.2s)]
*  actually are in the military operation [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=143.6s)]
*  that took place overnight, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=146.44s)]
*  what Israel called a preemptive strike [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  on multiple locations in Iran. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=151.16s)]
*  I have heard, John, through my reporting today, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=154.28s)]
*  calling many regional officials [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=156.56s)]
*  that Secretary of State Rubio was working the phones [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  hours in advance of the Israeli initial strike, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=161.32s)]
*  warning allies that something was coming, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  but this is not us. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=167.48s)]
*  That was the message he relayed. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=169.36s)]
*  This is not us. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  The U.S. distancing itself a bit here. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  We are trying to really pin that down [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=175.8s)]
*  because President Trump this morning is touting the fact [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=178.28s)]
*  that Israel is using not just defense systems [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=181.44000000000003s)]
*  like the one that may be intercepting those missiles, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  but also American-provided and paid-for weapons [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=185.84s)]
*  to carry out the strikes in Tehran. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=188.96s)]
*  But this is very much an ongoing military operation. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=190.8s)]
*  As we watch the military operation continue, Margaret, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=193.96s)]
*  I want to explore some of those gaps [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  you were just describing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=198.32s)]
*  The first is, could it be just a semantic gap [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=200.36s)]
*  in terms of the Iranians are saying, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=203.52s)]
*  pardon me, the Israelis are saying [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=206.64s)]
*  that the Iranian program is further along [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=208.08s)]
*  than U.S. intelligence? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=210.84s)]
*  Could it be just a language issue [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=213.84s)]
*  in terms of just how the two countries, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=215.68s)]
*  the United States and Israel, define those two things, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=217.64s)]
*  or could it be an actual dispute over intel [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=220.08s)]
*  over what exactly Iran has? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=223.72s)]
*  It may be that. It may be on the substance, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=226.72s)]
*  different intelligence assessments, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=230.04s)]
*  and we're trying to pin some of that down [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=232.76s)]
*  in his address last night. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=234.72s)]
*  The prime minister of Israel said something very different [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=236.24s)]
*  from one of his military officers. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=239.36s)]
*  A military officer went and briefed the press [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=240.96s)]
*  and said Iran had enough nuclear fuel for 15 weapons. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=242.76s)]
*  The prime minister said they had enough nuclear fuel for nine [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=246.12s)]
*  and that they could do it in months or in as little as a year. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=249.36s)]
*  And then others briefed in moments. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=253.92s)]
*  Iran would have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=256.16s)]
*  So we're trying to even just get clarity [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=257.64s)]
*  on exactly what Israel's own assessment is [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=259.52s)]
*  and then how much it may differ [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=262.76s)]
*  from the U.S. intelligence assessment. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=264.72s)]
*  And anyone can go, by the way, find that online. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=266.6s)]
*  It's published. It's publicly readable [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=268.52s)]
*  what the findings of the U.S. intelligence community was [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=270.8s)]
*  because as of this March, they said Iran's nuclear program [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=273.76s)]
*  ended in 2003. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  It's the nuclear fuel they've been concerned about. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=279.44s)]
*  The nature of the Iranian threat, of course, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=282.0s)]
*  being important to understand whether this action [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=283.8s)]
*  is commensurate with the level of the threat. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=287.32s)]
*  Let me also explore what you were discussing, Margaret, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=290.12s)]
*  in terms of U.S. involvement. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=292.48s)]
*  You said the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=294.56s)]
*  is on the phone saying, this is not us. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=296.44s)]
*  But as you pointed out, President Trump seemed [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  to be suggesting something else, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=301.68s)]
*  that he was involved in this operation, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=303.12s)]
*  at least in one form or another, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=305.44s)]
*  or knew that it was going on for a good long while. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=307.72s)]
*  So I kind of want to know, which is it? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=311.28s)]
*  Maybe the U.S. wasn't pushing any buttons, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  but give me your assessment of how much takes place [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  without the U.S. being involved, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  or how an operation of this size and significance [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=323.67999999999995s)]
*  could happen without the U.S. being involved in some fashion. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=327.08s)]
*  Well, in some ways, John, the short answer is, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=331.52s)]
*  Israel always assumes that America has its back, period. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=334.23999999999995s)]
*  That has been the risk that some American presidents [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=339.0s)]
*  have said exists, if Israel was to go through with a strike [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=342.56s)]
*  that could have unintended consequences, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=346.68s)]
*  because American forces, they assume, will back them up. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=348.92s)]
*  That's that sort of concern about something spiraling here. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  But Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=356.24s)]
*  has been arguing this time it is different. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=358.20000000000005s)]
*  The chessboard has changed. Iran is historically weak. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=360.48s)]
*  That they can carry out this really extensive intelligence [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=363.68s)]
*  and military operation and make a difference here. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=368.64s)]
*  We know through our own reporting [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=371.44s)]
*  that President Trump in months past [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=373.12s)]
*  had really pressed back on that, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=375.32s)]
*  saying, give me time with the diplomacy. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=377.08s)]
*  Don't go and do this. I'm trying to negotiate here. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=380.28s)]
*  So he was really leaning into the diplomacy [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=385.68s)]
*  and pushing back on the prime minister's desire [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=388.84s)]
*  to go ahead with this military operation. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=391.47999999999996s)]
*  Exactly what changed is something [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=394.12s)]
*  we're still trying to pin down here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=396.0s)]
*  Did he green light it and say go, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=398.36s)]
*  or did he simply just not really get in the way? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=400.92s)]
*  Thank you so much, Margaret. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=404.92s)]
*  We're watching live video here from Tel Aviv. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=405.92s)]
*  I'm not going to guess about whether that's incoming or outgoing, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=409.12s)]
*  but we certainly see lots of activity in the air above Tel Aviv. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=412.28s)]
*  Those are live pictures. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=416.76s)]
*  As Iran attacks Israel, the Israeli military says, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=418.08s)]
*  the rocket fire continues. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=422.92s)]
*  Another barrage of dozens of rockets [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=424.36s)]
*  has been launched towards Israel. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=426.12s)]
*  I want, as we're watching these live pictures now [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=428.4s)]
*  of the Iranian assault on Israel, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=431.08s)]
*  I want to bring in Senior White House correspondent [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=433.68s)]
*  Weijia Zhang, who joins us now. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=435.44s)]
*  Weijia, what have we heard, we in the press, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=437.96s)]
*  that is to say, from President Trump about this operation [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=441.15999999999997s)]
*  and how much the U.S. was or was not involved? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=445.56s)]
*  Well, John, since this assault on Israel began, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=449.71999999999997s)]
*  we have not heard from President Trump yet [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  or from the White House for that matter. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=456.0s)]
*  Of course, this just started unfolding minutes ago, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=457.79999999999995s)]
*  but certainly the president had a lot to say this morning, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=460.68s)]
*  making the rounds, talking to reporters, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=464.12s)]
*  and I am told by several White House sources [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=466.2s)]
*  that the reporting about what he said is accurate, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=469.71999999999997s)]
*  and that matters because he is signaling [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=473.76s)]
*  that he did not get a, quote, heads up, John, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=477.03999999999996s)]
*  but at the same time, he said it wasn't a heads up. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=480.56s)]
*  It was, well, we know what's going on, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=483.72s)]
*  so he's acknowledging that he was aware [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=487.64000000000004s)]
*  of the Israeli strikes that ultimately [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=491.08000000000004s)]
*  were carried out yesterday, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=494.84000000000003s)]
*  but does not want to use certain language [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=496.12s)]
*  because, once again, the administration is trying to stress [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=498.88000000000005s)]
*  that this was carried out independently of the U.S. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=502.68s)]
*  We also know that the president spoke on the phone [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  this morning with the Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  although we haven't extracted any nuggets [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=512.12s)]
*  about exactly what they talked about, John, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=515.44s)]
*  but just to go back to that first statement [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=518.04s)]
*  from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=520.96s)]
*  who is also serving as the current [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=523.36s)]
*  national security advisor, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=525.76s)]
*  it's important to note, John, that, again, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=528.0s)]
*  he wanted to stress that this had nothing to do with the U.S., [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=530.24s)]
*  that we are taking steps to protect our American interests [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=533.6s)]
*  and personnel in the region. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=537.12s)]
*  He did not use the word support. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  He did not say the U.S. supports or stands next to Israel [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=541.0799999999999s)]
*  as they carry out this operation, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=545.24s)]
*  which was notable to me because it was a departure [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=547.64s)]
*  from what we've seen from other official statements [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=551.64s)]
*  from the U.S. when they talk about providing [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=554.1999999999999s)]
*  any kind of support to Israel. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=556.64s)]
*  The president, I think, just wrapped up a meeting [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=560.04s)]
*  with his entire National Security Council [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=562.7199999999999s)]
*  inside the Situation Room. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=565.4s)]
*  We are also anticipating some kind of readout from that [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=567.16s)]
*  as they assess what to do, next steps, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=571.08s)]
*  and how to alter the message now [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=574.76s)]
*  that Israel is taking all this fire from Iran. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=578.08s)]
*  John? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=581.44s)]
*  Weijia Zhang at the White House for us. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=582.28s)]
*  Weijia, thank you so much for that update. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=584.04s)]
*  Once again, Iran says it has launched [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=585.72s)]
*  hundreds of ballistic missiles [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=587.64s)]
*  attacking dozens of targets in Israel [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=589.48s)]
*  as part of its retaliation for Israel's attack last night [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=591.84s)]
*  and the waves of attacks that started since last night. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=595.0799999999999s)]
*  Our coverage will continue on CBS News 24 seven, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=597.9599999999999s)]
*  your local news, and for some of you, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=600.7199999999999s)]
*  tonight on the CBS Evening News, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=602.68s)]
*  this has been a CBS News special report. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=604.36s)]
*  I'm John Dickerson in New York. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73P6jtyrYLQ&t=606.64s)]
