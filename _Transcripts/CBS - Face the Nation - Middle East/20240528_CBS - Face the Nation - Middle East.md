# U.S. won't change Israel policy after airstrike on Rafah tent camp
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34)
*  Now, let's turn to our Ed O'Keefe. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=0.0s)]
*  He's at the White House tonight, covering the latest on this weekend's deadly strike [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=2.64s)]
*  in Rafa. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=6.72s)]
*  Ed, the international criticism for Sunday's attack in Rafa has been swift. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=7.72s)]
*  It has been widespread. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=12.92s)]
*  And the White House has called the strike heartbreaking, but also says it won't change [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=13.92s)]
*  any U.S. policy because of it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=18.26s)]
*  Today, you asked John Kirby about why. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=20.68s)]
*  What did he have to say? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=23.84s)]
*  Yeah, Weishia, good to see you on something completely different. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=24.84s)]
*  And you're right, the condemnation pretty swift from around the world here at the White [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=27.639999999999997s)]
*  House. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  Criticism and concern about the death of those civilians, but no change in policy, in essence [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  because it was an airstrike, not a major ground offensive, that led to the deaths of those [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=36.1s)]
*  dozens of civilians. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=40.96s)]
*  Take a listen to the exchange with John Kirby. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=41.96s)]
*  How many more charred corpses does he have to see before the president considers a change [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=44.96s)]
*  in policy? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=53.8s)]
*  There's only a single more innocent life taken. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=54.8s)]
*  And I kind of take a little offense at the question. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  No civilian casualties is the right number of civilian casualties. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=60.0s)]
*  And this is not something that we've turned a blind eye to, nor has it been something [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=64.14s)]
*  we've ignored or neglected to raise with our Israeli counterparts, including Ed, this weekend [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=67.47999999999999s)]
*  as a result of this particular strike. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=73.25999999999999s)]
*  Now, they're investigating it, so let's let them investigate it and see what they come [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  up with. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=78.7s)]
*  But the president doesn't have like a personal limit to this? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=79.7s)]
*  The president has been very clear and very direct about what our expectations are for [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=83.76s)]
*  Israeli operations in Ra'aqa specifically, but in Gaza writ large. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=89.12s)]
*  We don't support, we won't support a major ground operation in Ra'aqa. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=94.2s)]
*  And we've, again, been very consistent on that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=99.44s)]
*  And the president said that should that occur, then it might make him have to make different [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=102.0s)]
*  decisions in terms of support. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=108.16000000000001s)]
*  So again, there you see them defending the current policy. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=113.44s)]
*  But over this, over the course of the briefing, a series of questions about this, in essence, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=117.24s)]
*  Kirby kept saying, we just look, because it was an airstrike, as deadly as it was, perhaps [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=122.44s)]
*  because now of a secondary blast that was caused to lead to this explosion that we see [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=128.2s)]
*  there on camera, you know, and not some other major offensive launched by the Israelis into [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=133.32s)]
*  that is still considered acceptable despite the civilian casualties. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=140.48s)]
*  They point out there were strikes like this in recent days and last week targeting various [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=143.76s)]
*  Hamas leaders that didn't lead to civilian casualties. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=148.72s)]
*  So in essence, they're being consistent with what was being carried out last week. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=151.72s)]
*  You're right, Ed, that they have made this distinction between a ground offensive versus [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=155.6s)]
*  an airstrike. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=160.16s)]
*  But they've also said that the line depends on how densely populated an area is and how [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=161.16s)]
*  many civilian casualties there are. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  And they have said from the beginning that they've told Israel to limit civilian casualties. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=170.84s)]
*  But with these two strikes in the last several days, there continues to be mounting pressure [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=176.56s)]
*  for them to do something different. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=181.56s)]
*  Are there any indications that it will? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=184.4s)]
*  As of today, no. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=189.28s)]
*  Between domestic political pressure from fellow Democrats and others concerned about this, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=190.28s)]
*  most notably the French president Emmanuel Macron, who in English was decrying what happened [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=195.24s)]
*  over the weekend, not in French, in essence, trying to make sure the rest of the world [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=200.28s)]
*  was seeing this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=203.36s)]
*  There is, you know, obviously pressure on the president to do this. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=204.96s)]
*  But as of now, they made clear here at the White House and at the Pentagon, no change [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=207.8s)]
*  in policy despite those civilian deaths. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  Amicia. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=213.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=214.88s)]
*  Ed O'Keefe, thank you so much. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3HMgwZQ34&t=215.88s)]
