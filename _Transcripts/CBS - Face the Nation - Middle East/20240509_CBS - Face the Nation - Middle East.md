Video Description: President Biden said the U.S. will not supply Israel with weapons if it launched its planned military offensive in Gaza's southern city of Rafah. Last week, the U.S. paused a shipment of bombs to Israel over concerns about the impact some of the weapons could have in Gaza. CBS News' Ramy Inocencio and Nancy Cordes have more.

# Biden threatens to halt weapons supply to Israel if it launches Rafah offensive
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c)
*  We begin this hour at the White House where President Biden is signaling a major shift [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=0.0s)]
*  in policy. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=5.96s)]
*  He says the U.S. will not supply Israel with offensive weapons if it goes ahead with the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=6.96s)]
*  military assault on Gaza's southern city of Ra'a. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=10.64s)]
*  This comes after it was revealed the U.S. paused the shipment of bombs to Israel last [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=15.88s)]
*  week and made concerns over the impact that weapons could have in the region. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=18.72s)]
*  In a moment, we're going to talk with our correspondent Nancy Cordes at the White House. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  But first, let's go to Rami Anasensio. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=26.32s)]
*  He's in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=28.28s)]
*  Good morning, Enri. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=29.84s)]
*  And angry reactions are flying from Israel's far-right politicians to President Biden, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=30.84s)]
*  Israel's national security minister posted on ex-Hamas heart emoji Biden. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=35.800000000000004s)]
*  Another lawmaker said the president's action jeopardizes Israel and the entire free world. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=41.52s)]
*  Every day in Ra'a now, frightened Gazans are flooding the city's last functioning hospital [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=48.28s)]
*  with a newly wounded and a dead. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=53.36s)]
*  The health situation in Ra'a is now very miserable. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=56.36s)]
*  Dr. Jabal Alhams told CBS News his hospital is struggling to cope, overflowing and understaffed. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=59.88s)]
*  All areas are not safe. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=67.0s)]
*  All areas are targeted. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=68.96s)]
*  All areas are in by airstrikes. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=71.28s)]
*  For the first time in this most recent war, Israel is in control of the Palestinian side [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=74.72s)]
*  of the Ra'a crossing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=79.76s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stayed the course for a major military operation [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=82.28s)]
*  on Ra'a, believed to be Hamas' last stronghold. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=86.88s)]
*  In recent days, the militant group has still launched attacks from Ra'a, one strike killed [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  four Israeli soldiers. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=95.44s)]
*  But 1.4 million people are crammed into Ra'a, and President Biden has now very publicly [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  warned Israel, do not escalate its invasion. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=103.6s)]
*  It's just wrong. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  We're not going to supply the weapons and the artillery shells used. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  The Pentagon confirmed a U.S. shipment of 3,500 bombs was paused, concerned Israel will [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=113.28s)]
*  drop them on one of the densest places on the planet. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=119.0s)]
*  I've made it clear to Bibi and the War Cabinet they're not going to get our support if, in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=122.36000000000001s)]
*  fact, they go into these population centers. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  We're not walking away from Israel's security, walking away from Israel's ability to wage [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=129.44s)]
*  war in those areas. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=134.08s)]
*  Israeli national security expert Chuck Freilich. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=136.36s)]
*  The shipment that's been paused, how does it affect the operations in Rafenau? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=139.24s)]
*  Well, in the short run, it won't affect operations, but I think it's sending a very, very strong [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=143.32000000000002s)]
*  message, which has the defense establishment very, very deeply disturbed. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=149.36s)]
*  Freilich also told us that even though Israel may be beating Hamas militarily, Israel may [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=156.88000000000002s)]
*  have already lost in terms of its international standing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  That, he said, is an incredible achievement for Hamas. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  Anne Marie. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=168.88s)]
*  All right, Rami, thank you. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=169.88s)]
*  For more on the president's warning, CBS News Chief White House correspondent Nancy [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  Cordes is joining us now. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  So Nancy, last time we spoke about this when we got the news of the bomb delivery being [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  sort of held up, we didn't get a chance to really dig in. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=180.64s)]
*  Now the president in this CNN interview has reiterated his concerns about how American [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=183.76s)]
*  weapons are used. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=190.06s)]
*  Why is he making this move now? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  Because, Anne Marie, after weeks and months of Israel threatening to invade Ra'afa, it [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=194.64s)]
*  was becoming increasingly clear that that invasion could be imminent based on what Netanyahu [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=200.52s)]
*  himself was saying, the seizure of the Palestinian side of the Ra'afa Gate. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=206.92s)]
*  There were a number of moves that made U.S. officials very concerned that the Israelis [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=213.56s)]
*  were planning to invade this city packed with 1.4 million Palestinians despite the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  repeated warnings by the Biden administration that the U.S. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=226.60000000000002s)]
*  simply could not support this move if Israel didn't do more to protect Palestinian [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=232.88s)]
*  civilians first. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=239.36s)]
*  And it appeared to U.S. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=240.88s)]
*  officials that the Israelis simply weren't listening to those warnings. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=242.56s)]
*  And so they went ahead and took this very unusual step of withholding 3,500 bombs that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=246.92s)]
*  were supposed to be headed to Israel. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=255.52s)]
*  It obviously sent a signal around the world. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=257.84s)]
*  The White House knew that it would get some backlash from the right, but clearly they [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=261.08s)]
*  felt it was important to send this message, and so they went ahead with it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=265.2s)]
*  Yeah, and this is definitely sort of a shift in the president's approach over this entire [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=268.64s)]
*  period of time. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=273.64s)]
*  What he would do before is always publicly show ironclad support for Israel, perhaps [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=275.56s)]
*  privately putting pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=281.4s)]
*  But now we're hearing public concern and criticism, but of course that opens him up to criticism. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=284.56s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump slammed the decision on truth social in a post. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=290.88s)]
*  No surprise there, but other than that, there is some political risk for the president. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=295.36s)]
*  Right, and there was really political risk either way, Anne-Marie. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=299.84s)]
*  We have talked so often about the fact that his left flank, young voters, progressive [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=303.72s)]
*  voters have been increasingly sounding the alarm about what they are seeing in Gaza, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=310.08s)]
*  and they were putting an immense amount of pressure on this president. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=315.52s)]
*  And so, yes, he takes political risk by taking this step. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=320.72s)]
*  We saw a very sternly worded letter from Republican leaders yesterday saying that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=326.72s)]
*  this move weakens Israel, that it sends an encouraging message to Israel's enemies in [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=333.56s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=340.91999999999996s)]
*  But the world really was placing pressure on the U.S. to use this leverage. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=342.84s)]
*  And you and I have talked so many times, Anne-Marie, about what could the U.S. do if Israel continues [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  down this road and the president keeps saying he doesn't like it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=357.28s)]
*  What can the U.S. do? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=360.88s)]
*  Can it withdraw military aid? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, clearly the president was not prepared to go that far. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=364.36s)]
*  He said that the U.S. will continue to support Israel, give Israel the tools it needs to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=367.12s)]
*  defend itself, but he wasn't going to give Israel the bombs, he said, that it might use [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=371.8s)]
*  to kill civilians in Ra'a. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=378.32s)]
*  That was simply a line he wasn't willing to cross at this point. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=381.2s)]
*  And before I let you go, I want to ask you about something else he mentioned on that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=384.12s)]
*  CNN interview. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=387.76s)]
*  He was really highlighting his record on the economy. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=388.76s)]
*  I want to play some of what he said. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=391.2s)]
*  We've created more jobs. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=392.92s)]
*  We may be in a situation where people have access to good-paying jobs. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=395.52s)]
*  And the last I saw, the combination of the inflation, the cost of inflation, all those [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  things, that's really worrisome to people with good reason. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=407.15999999999997s)]
*  That's why I'm working very hard to bring the cost of rentals down, to increase the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=410.08s)]
*  number of homes that are available. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=414.28s)]
*  Let me put it this way. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  When I started this administration, people were saying there was going to be a collapse [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=419.96s)]
*  of the economy. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  We have the strongest economy in the world. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  So this has always been a challenge for the president to tackle because it doesn't matter [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=429.64s)]
*  what the latest report says about how the economy is doing. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=436.35999999999996s)]
*  All that matters is how people feel. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=439.64s)]
*  In this response, I see a bit more of an acknowledgement that it's tough out there for a lot of people. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=441.71999999999997s)]
*  But how's this messaging going? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=446.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think he's really attempting to make two points in his recent interview and in [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=449.64s)]
*  his recent speeches. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  For one, he's saying yes, inflation is high. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=458.59999999999997s)]
*  I acknowledge that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=461.08s)]
*  Prices have gone up. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=462.32s)]
*  But the U.S. is in a better place than most other countries in the world. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=464.24s)]
*  And that's true. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=468.2s)]
*  Inflation has come down more rapidly in the U.S. than a lot of other developing nations. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=469.2s)]
*  And he argues that his policies are to thank for that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=474.0s)]
*  But beyond that, he is trying to draw a clear contrast between his record and Donald Trump's [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=477.92s)]
*  record because we've been seeing in poll after poll that Americans look back at the economy [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=484.68s)]
*  of the Trump years with some nostalgia. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=490.72s)]
*  We did a recent poll of the battleground state of Wisconsin, for example, where President [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=493.24s)]
*  Biden was yesterday. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=496.76s)]
*  Sixty-two percent of voters there say they think the economy was better under Trump. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=498.32s)]
*  But that's very frustrating for the Biden White House because back in 2020, when Trump [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=502.92s)]
*  was president, when we polled Wisconsin voters, guess what? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  Only 36 percent of them said they thought the economy was good. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=512.32s)]
*  And so the Biden team feels that people are looking back with rose-tinted glasses and [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=516.76s)]
*  they're trying to draw a clearer contrast between here's how many jobs have been created [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=521.88s)]
*  in this administration, here's how many jobs were created in that administration, and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=526.12s)]
*  really trying to make the argument that, you know, that the way you remember it is not [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=530.92s)]
*  exactly the way that it went down. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=536.56s)]
*  Yeah. Hence the comparison between the Foxconn promised jobs versus what President Biden [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=539.0799999999999s)]
*  said he's actually going to deliver. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=545.3199999999999s)]
*  That's really interesting, Nancy. Thank you very much. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaFQRrwe1c&t=547.1999999999999s)]
