# Israel says it’s begun retaliatory strikes against Iran | full coverage
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4)
*  U.S. demands for restraint. President Biden has often called for restraint, saying that it could [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=0.0s)]
*  be a contingent on arms deals in the future. And this has happened in the past. But clearly, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=6.24s)]
*  this is a sign that Prime Minister Netanyahu and his cabinet, as well as his military, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=12.32s)]
*  are going forth with striking on Iran, which is in retaliation. But at this point, we've seen [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=19.2s)]
*  airstrikes and retaliation, airstrikes and retaliation. And the question is, is this one-off [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=26.32s)]
*  precision, or is this going to inflame the region even further and cause Iran to want to retaliate [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=32.96s)]
*  in a bigger way? So let's dive deeper into that, Courtney, because I remember back in April when [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=39.36s)]
*  we were, when I was at this desk covering a very similar story. At that point, Tehran launched a [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=46.64s)]
*  barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles targeting Israel. That was in response to a, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=52.88s)]
*  the embassy building in Damascus, the Iranian embassy in Damascus, being hit and killing three [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=61.36s)]
*  top Iranian commanders and four officers. At that point, Iran said that they were going to retaliate. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=68.64s)]
*  They did so. Israel then said that they would retaliate. They did so. And then it just sort of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=74.48s)]
*  stopped, at least in terms of active weapons being fired between these two countries. Of course, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=80.24s)]
*  the proxy war continued. Do we expect now, because this had long been telegraphed, that Israel was [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=85.91999999999999s)]
*  going to respond to these most recent barrage of attacks by Iran, that that will be potentially [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  the end of this and things will go back to more of that shadow war with Hezbollah and Hamas receiving [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=98.96s)]
*  funding and instructions in many cases from Iran? Or do we expect that Iran will continue to retaliate [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=106.48s)]
*  more directly? Well, Lana, remember you and I were on the desk and we were talking about the death of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=112.56s)]
*  Ismail Haniyeh when he went to the inauguration of the new Iranian president into Iran that was [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=118.4s)]
*  carried out on Iranian soil, and that was a provocation. Then there was the death of Hassan [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=124.48s)]
*  Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah and an Iranian proxy that definitely answers to Iran. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=131.28s)]
*  So we have been waiting to see after the latest ballistic missiles that were launched at Israel [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=138.4s)]
*  that were shot down with the help of allies, this would be the second time it happened. Now [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=144.0s)]
*  Israel is responding. So it continues going back and forth and back and forth. But Israel [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=148.88s)]
*  attacking Iran is unprecedented. It's not something people wanted to see. They wanted to see [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=155.52s)]
*  peace talks this Sunday, not waking up after Shabbat in the Middle East and in Tehran hearing [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=160.96s)]
*  explosions and the Israeli military taking responsibility for this. This is, this is, it is [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  a retaliation, but it's also a provocation. It is the middle of the night over in Israel and over [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=175.28s)]
*  in Iran. I want to play a little bit of sound that we've just received from the IDF. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=182.64s)]
*  Like every other sovereign country in the world, the state of Israel has the right and the duty [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=191.6s)]
*  to respond. Our defensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilized. We will do [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  whatever necessary to defend the state of Israel and the people of Israel. In response to months [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=206.8s)]
*  of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the state of Israel, right now the Israel [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  defense forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran. The regime in Iran and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=220.88000000000002s)]
*  its proxies in the region have been relentlessly attacking Israel since October 7th on seven fronts [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=229.28s)]
*  including direct attacks from Iranian soil. Like every other sovereign country in the world, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=236.96s)]
*  the state of Israel has the right and the duty to respond. Our defensive and offensive capabilities [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=243.84s)]
*  are fully mobilized. We will do whatever necessary to defend the state of Israel [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  and the people of Israel. In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=259.68s)]
*  against the state of Israel, right now the Israel defense forces is conducting precise strikes [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=266.0s)]
*  on military targets in Iran. The regime in Iran and its proxies in the region have been relentlessly [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=274.16s)]
*  attacking Israel since October 7th on seven fronts. So we heard there the IDF statement. It matches [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=281.68s)]
*  the paper statement that we have. So we've heard it a couple of times now. I want to bring in CBS [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=289.6s)]
*  News national security contributor Sam Vinograd. Sam, what do you make of that statement released [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=294.16s)]
*  by the IDF? Certainly trying to signal two things. Number one, that it will not stop its efforts [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=299.92s)]
*  to diminish Iran's ability to harm the state of Israel. Israel has been doing that by trying to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=308.56s)]
*  decrease capabilities for Iran's proxy forces and by retaliating against Iran for their historic and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=315.12s)]
*  unprecedented attacks into Israel itself. So the IDF is signaling that they will not back down from [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=321.92s)]
*  that mission. Number two, they're signaling that they view this as defensive, that these are not [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=328.0s)]
*  offensive moves, that these are defensive in nature. They also specifically focus on the fact [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=335.92s)]
*  that they have struck military targets. They did not strike oil infrastructure or nuclear sites. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=343.76s)]
*  They struck military targets. That is likely an effort to prevent this tit for tat from escalating [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=349.28s)]
*  further. Now, I will note, it is important to note, that the White House has been supportive of Israel [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  taking measures to defend itself. So while we have reporting that the White House asked Israel not to [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=363.35999999999996s)]
*  strike oil infrastructure and nuclear sites, we do understand that the United States was supportive [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=368.32s)]
*  of Israel retaliating against Iran in some capacity. And it looks like the White House [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=374.56s)]
*  was successful in convincing Israel to limit its retaliatory strike to military sites. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=380.16s)]
*  All right, Sam, thank you. Stay right there. I'm going to have some more questions for you, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=386.16s)]
*  but we want to go at this point to CBS News Chief Foreign Affairs correspondent and Face the Nation [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=389.92s)]
*  moderator Margaret Brennan. She joins us now on the phone. Margaret, we're talking a lot about the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=394.64s)]
*  context of these strikes and hope that it was perhaps going to, after the death of Yaya Sinwar, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=401.04s)]
*  perhaps there was an opportunity for peace. It looks like this is moving in a different direction. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=410.48s)]
*  Talk to us about the significance and what your sources are telling you. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=416.72s)]
*  So this strike by Israel, the Israel Defense Forces against Iran, has been expected since [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=421.36s)]
*  October 1st attack by Israel or by Iran on Israel, an attack that failed in its mission, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=427.84s)]
*  a attack that was intercepted by Israel quite easily with U.S. support as well. And that itself [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=434.88s)]
*  was retaliation for the assassination of the leader of Hezbollah. So this has been an escalation [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=442.08s)]
*  that was expected. However, within the context of what Israel was mulling over publicly, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  it is fairly limited. The IDF says it hit military targets, as Sam Vinograd was explaining. That's [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=457.2s)]
*  significant in part because President Biden went out and publicly said Israel should not hit oil [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=463.44s)]
*  installations, something that Iran vowed they would then go on to attack other oil installations [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  in other countries, thus driving up energy prices. They were also publicly warned not to attack [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=476.56s)]
*  nuclear sites. Iran has a nuclear development program, but not yet a weapons program. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=482.8s)]
*  And there has been concern that an attack that was so strong or directed at the nuclear program [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=489.84000000000003s)]
*  could actually trigger them to race towards a weapon. So those were all the things the U.S. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=498.32000000000005s)]
*  officials were debating here as they helped counsel Israel on how to carry out a retaliation [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  that wasn't going to further inflame the region but would allow them to walk away saying that they [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=510.88s)]
*  had struck back. Now, we will see, get an assessment as to what these military targets were, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=516.32s)]
*  how significant the attack is. But already the United States has in place equipment to help [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=523.6s)]
*  fend off an expected Iranian retaliation for what just happened. That FAD missile system, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=528.4s)]
*  the anti-missile system that the United States sent, also means America has skin in the game. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=534.16s)]
*  U.S. personnel on the ground to try to help intercept. And that is also how the United [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=539.36s)]
*  States had some leverage here to this time get a heads up. This is important. The United States [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=544.72s)]
*  was given a heads up that this attack was going to occur in those recent attacks on Hezbollah and [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=550.08s)]
*  attacks on other leaders of proxy groups like Hamas. Israel has not been giving the United States [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=557.12s)]
*  more than a 20-minute heads up. This time the United States was part of that process, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=563.92s)]
*  and that is significant. That is significant, especially given the ways in which we know the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=569.1999999999999s)]
*  Biden administration was frustrated by not being looped in on this. Margaret, given that this was [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=574.4s)]
*  expected that they were going to retaliate, that it does appear at this point that it was limited [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=580.0s)]
*  to military targets, if all of that in fact plays out, do you expect a similar situation to what we [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=584.3199999999999s)]
*  saw back in April? In terms of an Iranian response, yes, that is why that that system was put in [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=589.6s)]
*  place, but there are also back channel efforts to try to limit the scope of that. Iran has [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=598.32s)]
*  consistently been shown to be 10 feet tall, as military officials have said to me. Iran's ability [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=603.84s)]
*  to execute an attack on Israel both in April, then October 1st, failed. They were able to fire [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=611.6800000000001s)]
*  ballistic missiles, but when they did so, they pretty much ran through their stockpile at that [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=618.96s)]
*  moment, 180 to 200 at a time. They were not able to make contact with the targets that they really [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=622.88s)]
*  aimed to at least publicly vowed to hit. So they are showing themselves to be weakened. They have [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=630.5600000000001s)]
*  also shown themselves to have lost some of their proxy forest leaders who they relied on strongly, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=637.6s)]
*  like the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. That was the most important proxy force in the [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=644.24s)]
*  region. When I say proxy force, I mean that's an unofficial militia, a military force for them in [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=649.52s)]
*  the region. So they are losing some of their ability to sort of stretch the long arm of the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=655.52s)]
*  Iranian state through the region. Israel is feeling good about that, and the prime minister has been [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=660.4s)]
*  saying that they have really started to break away the hold that Iran's axis of terror groups [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=666.72s)]
*  has held on the region. But keep in mind, this tit for tat, this killing terror leaders, this [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=674.5600000000001s)]
*  doesn't mean that it settles anything or that we're moving quickly towards peace. I will know, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=682.08s)]
*  however, the CIA director is expected on Sunday in Doha, Qatar to be meeting with the head of the [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=686.96s)]
*  Israeli intelligence agency, the Mossad, as well as the Qatari prime minister. This is one of those [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=692.08s)]
*  last ditch pre-U.S. election efforts to jumpstart any kind of process that would help free the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=697.2s)]
*  remaining hostages in Gaza. But there is also a Biden administration effort to stop the fighting [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=703.2s)]
*  on Israel's northern border with what remains of Hezbollah. Despite Israel taking out the [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=709.44s)]
*  leader of that militia, it has not stopped the fighting with Hezbollah that has kept Israelis [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=714.48s)]
*  from returning to their homes in the north. So these are significant measures, but they are not [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=719.36s)]
*  stopping what continues to be an expanding war in the region. So Margaret, just to circle back to [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=725.52s)]
*  the very first part of this, what are your sources saying then in terms of the prognosis for any [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=732.08s)]
*  additional peace talks? Well, the CIA director Bill Burns will be in Doha Sunday. That effort at, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=738.0s)]
*  it's not even really an effort at peace talks. It is an effort to free hostages that are still [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=747.28s)]
*  held by Hamas since the head, Yachaf Zinwar, the military commander who was also a political leader, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=754.0s)]
*  was killed recently. That just goes to show you, you can take out a terrorist leader, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=760.4s)]
*  you don't kill the ideology, and you haven't killed the fighting force. And that is the conundrum [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=766.0s)]
*  that the United States continues to press Israeli leaders that they need to confront. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=770.88s)]
*  There's pressure on the Israeli prime minister to come up with his own vision for ending the war [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=775.68s)]
*  and withdrawing forces from Gaza. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, was in the region until [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=782.56s)]
*  today really trying to pursue just that, offering suggestions and a plan and a proposal with support [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=786.88s)]
*  from other leaders in the region on who would go in and try to govern Gaza if the Israeli military [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=793.4399999999999s)]
*  were to pull back. So this has been a Biden administration effort. I am sure they will try [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=800.5600000000001s)]
*  to continue it after the U.S. election in the lame duck session, the remaining months of the [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=807.12s)]
*  Biden administration. But at this point, the prospects are pretty limited. It is widely known, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=813.36s)]
*  and the prime minister of Israel has acknowledged that he talked to Donald Trump. He has talked to [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=820.5600000000001s)]
*  him at least twice in the past few weeks. They are very much gauging what the U.S. leadership [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=825.92s)]
*  will look like and how that will factor into their plans on how they conduct their own business in [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=832.16s)]
*  the region. The U.S. election has reverberations around the world, and it certainly will in terms [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=838.7199999999999s)]
*  of the peace talks and any peace efforts, whether it's Lebanon, Gaza, or Iran. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=845.28s)]
*  Absolutely. Margaret Brennan, thank you. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=850.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=853.36s)]
*  If you are just joining us now, CBS News can report some breaking news out of the Middle East [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=854.24s)]
*  that Israel has launched some long anticipated retaliatory strikes on Iran. At this point, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=859.92s)]
*  it looks like it is limited to military targets. We want to go to CBS News Senior Foreign Affairs [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=866.48s)]
*  Correspondent—sorry, we're going to go to CBS News Foreign Correspondent Remy Inesensio. He is [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=872.16s)]
*  there in the theater. Remy, you first said that you were hearing about some reports of explosions [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=878.16s)]
*  in Iran just about an hour ago at this point. What more have you been able to learn? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=885.36s)]
*  Sure. Hi, Lana. Yes, about an hour ago, we did hear those initial reports of explosions coming [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=893.52s)]
*  out of Iran's capital of Tehran, in addition to another city just west of Tehran, the city of [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=899.8399999999999s)]
*  Qaraj, which is about 30 miles west of Tehran. And in that past hour, we have had confirmation [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=905.12s)]
*  from the Israel Defense Forces themselves, from spokesperson Daniel Hagari, saying that they are [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=913.12s)]
*  continuing to conduct precise strikes on what he says military targets there in Iran. And that, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=919.36s)]
*  of course, is important because how Israel strikes Iran will then dictate on what, if any, retaliation [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=926.16s)]
*  Iran might then do in response. We do, of course, have to stress that the U.S. has supplied a THAAD [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=933.2s)]
*  missile defense system here to Israel in the past week or so that is now up and running, and that, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=940.0s)]
*  we understand, had been put there in place in anticipation of any potential retaliation from Iran. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=944.88s)]
*  And Remy, it is currently the wee hours of the morning there in Israel. It's the middle of the [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=952.32s)]
*  night, but it's also Shabbat right now, 3 a.m. Is it surprising that this is happening right now? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=961.36s)]
*  Is there anything more that you can tell us about the timing? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=967.6s)]
*  It may be surprising from a religious aspect here. It is 3 a.m. here in Tel Aviv, 3 30 a.m. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=973.6800000000001s)]
*  in Tehran. But the fact of the matter is that this retaliation by Israel against Iran has been [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=981.28s)]
*  telegraphed for the past three weeks, ever since Iran fired its some 200 ballistic missiles [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=988.88s)]
*  at Israel on October 1st. So the timing of this, there was a comment from Israel saying [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=996.48s)]
*  that the retaliation, the strike, would be surprising. And so to your question regarding [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1003.9200000000001s)]
*  the nature of the evening, with it being the Sabbath right now, this could be the aspect of [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1009.7600000000001s)]
*  it that Iran might have been taken off guard just a little bit, perhaps thinking that Israel would [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1015.6s)]
*  not retaliate on the most important day of its week. It is worth noting, though, that it is the [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1021.0400000000001s)]
*  end of the holiday season there. Are we learning anything more, Remy, about potential damages in [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1027.2s)]
*  Iran, actual areas that were struck, or is it just at this point too early to know that? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1035.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's too early right now. Again, we heard only about an hour or so ago of those initial [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1041.04s)]
*  strikes. But we have been seeing initial reports of explosions, again, in and around the capital, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1050.1599999999999s)]
*  Tehran. There are unconfirmed reports that the headquarters and the barracks of the IRGC, that's [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1056.8s)]
*  the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps, have been targeted, but that's just initial unconfirmed [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1063.04s)]
*  reports there. As the hours continue on into the early part of the morning and as daylight comes, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1068.56s)]
*  we will see what damage has happened in Iran and what, if anything, Iranian state media does report [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1076.48s)]
*  out on this. But as we are right now at 3 a.m. in the morning, we're only hearing of explosions, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1083.04s)]
*  of reports, confirmation from the Israel Defense Forces, but no reports officially of any damage [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1088.32s)]
*  in Iran. Well, we know you will stay on top of it, Remy Anasensio in Tel Aviv. Thank you. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1094.56s)]
*  Of course. CBS News Senior National Security correspondent Charlie Daggett covers the Pentagon. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1101.44s)]
*  He is there for us now. Charlie, our viewers have heard a lot of discussion about the THAAD system [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1108.56s)]
*  that the United States has supplied. Give us some background information about how it operates and [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1115.04s)]
*  why it's important that or why it's notable that there are U.S. troops there to help operate it. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1120.8s)]
*  Lana, that's important. What you said was notable because this is the first time we've had [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1128.8799999999999s)]
*  U.S. troops on the ground in a combat capacity since October 7th. Yes, there have been U.S. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1133.52s)]
*  advisors there. There have been U.S. special forces trying to help hunt down hostages and help down [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1139.44s)]
*  hunt down targets, Hamas targets inside Gaza. This is the first time you're going to see [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1146.32s)]
*  soldiers on the ground in a combat role. And the reason is after that October 1st attack from Iran, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1150.96s)]
*  it was unexpected. The scale of the attack was unexpected. It's the largest [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1158.24s)]
*  ballistic missile attack in any country you've seen, let alone Israel. And it was between 180 [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1162.24s)]
*  and 200, as Remy said. And there were some of those ballistic missiles that got through. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1167.36s)]
*  Now, we all know the much-vaunted Israeli missile defense system. You've got the David Sling, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1173.36s)]
*  which takes over from the Iron Dome, which is more of a short-range. But this takes out short to [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1178.56s)]
*  mid-range ballistic missiles. So it was a specific weapon specifically put there and manned by U.S. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1183.68s)]
*  forces. This is important because if they're expecting that kind of Iranian retaliation, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1190.6399999999999s)]
*  this fills a gap there. It is a battalion—or sorry, it's a group of vehicles that can fire [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1195.76s)]
*  up to 48 interceptors, which doesn't sound like a lot. But the battleships that were involved in [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1203.76s)]
*  the intercepting of the Iranian missiles, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, on October 7th, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1209.84s)]
*  they only launched about 12 missiles. Okay? So that puts it in sort of reference as to what this [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1217.12s)]
*  THAAD system can do, potentially. And we have just received a statement from the National Security [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1222.24s)]
*  Council. It's short, but it says, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1228.88s)]
*  We understand that Israel is conducting targeted strikes against military targets in Iran [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1230.8s)]
*  as an exercise of self-defense and in response to Iran's ballistic missile attack against Israel [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1235.76s)]
*  on October 1st. Charlie, talk to us about the significance of coordination between [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1241.44s)]
*  Israel and the United States, both in terms of our longstanding partnerships, but also in terms of [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1249.2800000000002s)]
*  what has been, in some cases, a rocky relationship. It has, Lana, especially in recent weeks, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1255.92s)]
*  because as Margaret had pointed out, the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, that literally [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1262.64s)]
*  took place while Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant was on the phone to Defense Secretary [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1268.64s)]
*  Lloyd Austin, literally on the phone as that was taking place, a major escalation. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1276.6399999999999s)]
*  And then the retaliation against Iran, of course, the United States, we've got skin in the game, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1282.24s)]
*  certainly on the ground now inside Israel, but we have to remember there are 40,000 U.S. forces [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1289.28s)]
*  across that region, on the ground, through Iraq, in Syria, and then you have a carrier strike group [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1295.76s)]
*  you've got an aircraft carrier, a number of destroyers off the coast of the Mediterranean, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1306.08s)]
*  you've got a couple of destroyers and a amphibious group there with 2,000 marines. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1311.36s)]
*  You have a lot of U.S. military assets there, and the reason I mention that, not just in the [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1317.84s)]
*  defense of Israel, but if Israel attacks Iran, as it has done, it's now confirmed, as that has done, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1322.56s)]
*  that also puts U.S. forces in the line of fire. So there needs to be a coordination between [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1329.6799999999998s)]
*  Israel and the United States, because if something large scale like that happens, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1336.0s)]
*  then the United States, and I'm told this all the time here at the Pentagon, this is a planning [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1341.36s)]
*  organization, right? They plan for any contingency, so they have to plan for the retaliation from [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1345.84s)]
*  Israel, but then they have to expect, and one of the reasons that that system is in place, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1352.48s)]
*  that Iran will retaliate in kind. And I think it's very important to point out here, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1357.36s)]
*  the last time Israel retaliated from the Iranian attack, it was a matter of four or five days. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1362.08s)]
*  This is more than three weeks now, and I think that addresses the scale of the Iranian attack [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1368.48s)]
*  to begin with, and now I guess once again we're in this sort of hold pattern, a wait and see. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1373.6s)]
*  Was it a limited strike? I guess at first light we'll see what was targeted and the damage that [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1379.36s)]
*  was done and whether this will maybe escalate to see what the Iranians will do. But in terms [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1385.12s)]
*  of the United States, they're fully forward-postured, as they like to use that term, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1390.0s)]
*  with their military capabilities and capacities, including that U.S. missile defense system now in [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1394.96s)]
*  Israel. Well, Charlie, I'm so glad that you brought up the ways in which the United States has [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1401.52s)]
*  not just a military presence in the region, but also an obligation to all those folks that we have [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1408.56s)]
*  over there. As this proxy war between Israel and Iran has played out, and now it is not just a [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1416.4s)]
*  proxy, it is actively engaged, but the United States has also been involved in a more active [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1424.72s)]
*  way. I'm thinking specifically, as you're talking about this, about strikes against Houthi targets [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1430.64s)]
*  in Yemen that have been targeting U.S. and other foreign ships. Is it possible that in any way [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1436.0800000000002s)]
*  all that forward-facing U.S. defense planning will be implemented in any of these other aspects in [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1443.0400000000002s)]
*  the region? Lana, let me bring up something that happened just over a week ago. So the United [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1450.8000000000002s)]
*  States has been targeting Houthi targets inside Yemen. It's been going on for some time. There's [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1456.8000000000002s)]
*  sort of tit for tat going on that the Houthis have been shooting or aiming for anyway. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1462.64s)]
*  Um, commercial ships and U.S. battleships, U.S. battleships are fully capable of intercepting, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1468.8000000000002s)]
*  whether it's coming towards them or going somewhere else. But to launch a strike, to launch [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1475.3600000000001s)]
*  airstrikes, that's kind of next level. That's to go after the Houthis in Yemen itself. About a week [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1479.8400000000001s)]
*  ago, they launched B-2 bombers, B-2 stealth bombers. They don't launch those for any occasion. Those [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1485.76s)]
*  come from the United States. And the reason that it's important, that's important, these are stealth [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1491.8400000000001s)]
*  bombers, and they are capable of deep penetration, the deep bombs that can take out, in this case, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1496.48s)]
*  Houthi targets. And without saying so much, they're saying this is sending a message to regional [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1503.3600000000001s)]
*  partners. Essentially, if they can fire up a stealth bomber, fly at long distances and penetrate [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1509.92s)]
*  deep targets, well, that's a message, without saying it out loud, to Iran. So there has been [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1517.28s)]
*  a military flex. And that's the first time we've seen that happen, that they actually fired up B-2 [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1524.08s)]
*  bombers for these attacks in Yemen. So yes, you've got the aircraft carriers, you've got a number of [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1528.96s)]
*  F-18s there that are still deployed, F-35s that are still deployed, this is a squadron of F-22s [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1534.56s)]
*  that are still deployed. It's about as forward-postured, I hate to keep using that phrase, but it's the way [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1540.6399999999999s)]
*  the military use it, as it can be without another carrier strike group in the region, which may be [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1546.96s)]
*  under discussion. We can't confirm that yet. All right, Charlie Daggett at the Pentagon, thank you. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1553.04s)]
*  Thank you. We now have confirmation that the White House was, in fact, notified prior to these strikes [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1558.3999999999999s)]
*  on targets in Iran. And we want to go to CBS News Senior White House and political correspondent [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1567.52s)]
*  Ed O'Keefe. Ed, you are out there on the campaign trail. Let's discuss for just a moment [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1573.12s)]
*  how the decisions that Americans are making right now in terms of who they are going to put in the [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1580.48s)]
*  Oval Office, the implications that that has for what is happening in the Middle East. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1586.56s)]
*  Well, and nowhere perhaps more acutely, Lana, than this state of Michigan where we are tonight. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1593.6799999999998s)]
*  We are awaiting former President Donald Trump in Traverse City, Michigan. He is running behind [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1598.9599999999998s)]
*  schedule and is expected to be significantly behind schedule, having only left Texas in the [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1604.3999999999999s)]
*  last hour or so. He was supposed to start speaking about 45 minutes ago here. There are still [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1609.52s)]
*  several thousand people here in northern Michigan. But this issue has been a real personal one for [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1614.96s)]
*  people, especially in the Detroit area and towns like Dearborn, Hamtranck, where there are [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1620.72s)]
*  significant numbers of Arab and Muslim Americans who are voters who have been in great anguish over [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1626.72s)]
*  the past year over what exactly to do, knowing that it was the Biden administration that stands [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1634.08s)]
*  by Israel and has allowed all this violence to continue, but also knowing that Donald Trump [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1638.72s)]
*  potentially is a personally dangerous choice for them given policies he put in place when he was [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1644.16s)]
*  president and things he's threatened to do in the years since. Let me pass along one bit of White [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1650.08s)]
*  House news since that's part of what this correspondent does. We are told the president [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1654.16s)]
*  has been briefed on the situation. Israel has been kept apprised of the details throughout the [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1659.44s)]
*  afternoon and this evening. He is now back at his home in Delaware, having been in Arizona earlier [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1664.48s)]
*  today for an event, arrived home in Wilmington just a few minutes after Israel confirmed [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1669.1200000000001s)]
*  that it had conducted these military operations in Iran. The secretary of state landed at Joint [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1675.6s)]
*  Base Andrews just moments after the strike was confirmed by Israel. He's back from meetings in [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1680.64s)]
*  the Middle East and in London earlier today with his counterparts about what to do exactly in [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1686.24s)]
*  response to all of this. And as we've reported through sources of Margaret Brennan's and Charlie [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1691.04s)]
*  Daggett's and Ellie Watson's over at the Pentagon, the U.S. has been kept of course surprised of all [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1696.48s)]
*  this in the lead-up and had been working to delay and to sort of specify the response and ensure [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1701.2s)]
*  that it didn't necessarily hit Iranian nuclear targets or places related to its nuclear program, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1708.96s)]
*  but perhaps the more specific military ones. But this will be an issue out here on the campaign [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1715.36s)]
*  trail in the coming days. Trump is here tonight and tomorrow, Vice President Harris is coming [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1720.4s)]
*  here to Michigan tomorrow because the Wolverine state starts voting early tomorrow. And there's [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1724.96s)]
*  real concern among Democrats that they may not be able to put together the right mix of voter [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1729.76s)]
*  to win this state again. And it usually requires traditional Democratic voters, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1734.96s)]
*  union households in this state, African Americans, suburban types that are inclined to vote for [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1739.8400000000001s)]
*  Democrats. And yes, in and around Detroit and Dearborn and Hamtranck and other communities [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1745.6s)]
*  in Michigan, the Arab and Muslim voters who have traditionally voted for them who are either [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1751.2s)]
*  withholding support, some might be voting for Trump instead, or voting for third-party candidates. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1756.24s)]
*  We had a conversation last night with a handful that we'll be sharing through the weekend and [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1761.6s)]
*  into next week, personally quite anguished about all of this and yet knowing that they should be [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1765.36s)]
*  doing something. They should be voting and expressing their opinion either to punish Harris [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1771.84s)]
*  or to stick it to her by voting for Trump, by not voting at all, or potentially voting for someone [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1776.72s)]
*  else. And it will be an issue in this state's Senate race. One of the more competitive ones, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1782.32s)]
*  the Democrat Alyssa Slatkin running against the Republican Mike Rogers. It's been an issue for [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1786.48s)]
*  them as well for the same reason that there's such an influential block of voters that can swing [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1791.12s)]
*  elections in this state and who will be watching this over the weekend now, quite concerned again [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1795.9199999999998s)]
*  about members of their own community and their families in the region and the potential for [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1801.84s)]
*  widespread violence. And we do know that there is a razor-thin margin for the House, the Senate, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1805.04s)]
*  and the White House itself. So all of this is going to have major implications. Ed, let's stick [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1811.36s)]
*  with the White House for just another moment. We have a statement from the National Security Council. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1816.8s)]
*  It doesn't say much, but we have that confirmation that the White House was in fact kept in the loop. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1822.08s)]
*  Do we expect to hear anything from President Biden or Vice President Harris this evening? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1827.76s)]
*  We are not expecting anything currently from the president, given that we've been given what they [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1835.92s)]
*  call the lid, or essentially an end to his public day. That can always be lifted. But at this point [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1840.32s)]
*  and at this hour, it would seem unlikely he'd weigh in now. It's always possible he could do [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1846.48s)]
*  so tomorrow at some point. As for the vice president, she's the other one holding a big [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1850.8799999999999s)]
*  rally tonight down in Houston, Texas, of course, alongside the Congressman Colin Allred, who's [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1855.2s)]
*  running in the U.S. Senate race, and of course alongside the well-known Texas musicians Willie [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1860.88s)]
*  Nelson and Beyonce. As of now, there's no indication she's going to weigh in on this tonight, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1865.44s)]
*  because the event she's holding is more specifically designed to talk about concerns [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1870.16s)]
*  with access to abortion procedures in Texas and across the country. And it's a message they're [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1874.48s)]
*  very eager to convey. So whether she says something in person or in writing later or tomorrow, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1879.1200000000001s)]
*  we'll have to wait and see. But again, coming here to Michigan, where more than any other state, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1885.2s)]
*  what's happening in the Middle East has been an issue, there's no way she can ignore it. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1890.0800000000002s)]
*  Ed O'Keefe there in the battleground covering the latest in terms of politics, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1894.32s)]
*  as well as what's happening in our nation's capital. Thank you, Ed. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1899.04s)]
*  CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd has been sticking by us. So Sam, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1905.52s)]
*  let's recap what we know at this point. Tell us the latest. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1911.2s)]
*  We know that shortly ago, Israel launched retaliatory strikes into Iran against military [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1916.0s)]
*  targets. Both the Israeli Defense Forces and the National Security Council at the White House [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1923.3600000000001s)]
*  have emphasized that these are precision strikes and again, against military targets, not against [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1929.2s)]
*  oil infrastructure or nuclear sites. These strikes by Israel are an retaliation for Iran launching an [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1935.04s)]
*  unprecedented number of ballistic missiles into Israel earlier this month. Where we are at this [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1942.32s)]
*  moment, Lana, is waiting to hear exactly what targets Israel struck and whether there are any [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1948.56s)]
*  associated threats facing U.S. personnel in the region. We have about 40,000 military personnel [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1955.84s)]
*  in the region, as well as likely hundreds of thousands of American citizens, many of whom [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1961.68s)]
*  are dual citizens living in the region. So at this time again, we are waiting to hear what sites [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1967.04s)]
*  exactly were hit in Iran and whether there are any associated threats to U.S. personnel in the region. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1973.1200000000001s)]
*  And Sam, let's talk a little bit more about Secretary of State Antony Blinken having just [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1980.0s)]
*  been there in Israel earlier this week. How much do you think the U.S. knew about this? As we've [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1985.68s)]
*  all been discussing, Israel said that they plan to take retaliatory action. So at some level, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1992.48s)]
*  it's not a surprise. The timing is what is surprising and the extent of their targets is [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=1998.88s)]
*  something that we're still trying to ascertain at this moment. But talk to us about Blinken, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2005.68s)]
*  what he was doing there and where the U.S. is hoping their influence, their exertion of [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2011.36s)]
*  influence might lead Israel in the next few days. Well, I think it's important for our viewers to [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2018.24s)]
*  understand because there are certainly some narratives circulating on social media and [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2024.7199999999998s)]
*  elsewhere that the Biden administration tried to tell Israel not to retaliate against Iran. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2028.7199999999998s)]
*  And this has become a really politicized issue on the campaign trail as well. It is critical to note [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2034.56s)]
*  that almost immediately after Iran struck within Israel with an unprecedented number of ballistic [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2040.8s)]
*  missiles, President Biden and his administration voiced support for Israel's right to defend [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2046.8s)]
*  itself. The president, the national security adviser and other officials did indicate publicly [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2051.92s)]
*  that they were in consultations with their Israeli counterparts about the scale and scope of Israel's [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2057.84s)]
*  response to Iran's attack, as well as the timing. We know that the United States sent an advanced [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2063.7599999999998s)]
*  missile defense system known as a THAAD, as well as 100 U.S. service members to Israel to help [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2069.68s)]
*  provide for Israel's defense since Iran's attack. And we also know that consultations between the [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2075.8399999999997s)]
*  United States and Israel have been ongoing. There is reporting that the United States did receive [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2081.3599999999997s)]
*  more of a heads up for this Israeli action than we have received for previous Israeli operations. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2086.72s)]
*  So it looks like Israel and the United States discussed the scale and scope of timing and [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2093.68s)]
*  timing of this operation for several weeks. The Israel did not strike oil infrastructure and [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2098.88s)]
*  nuclear sites, which we have reporting the White House asked them not to do, but again, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2104.96s)]
*  focused on precision strikes against military targets. I am not wholly surprised by the timing [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2109.44s)]
*  of this operation, Lana. It's been several weeks since Iran's retaliatory strike. It was unlikely [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2115.6800000000003s)]
*  that Israel was going to wait much longer to launch this attack. And while this attack did occur during [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2121.04s)]
*  Shabbat, which is a holy time for the Jewish people, this certainly isn't the first time that [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2126.8s)]
*  Israel has taken really life or death actions, military actions, during Shabbat or during a [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2131.44s)]
*  holy period in order to defend itself. Thank you, Sam. We also, as you're talking about Shabbat, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2138.2400000000002s)]
*  it's also worth noting that there were many significant Jewish holidays that took place [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2145.6800000000003s)]
*  between the period in which Iran launched their strikes and when Israel has now responded. So [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2151.76s)]
*  perhaps that has something to do with the decision of timing. We're also hearing some [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2159.1200000000003s)]
*  unconfirmed reports at this point that there may have been also some strikes that were heard or [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2164.7200000000003s)]
*  explosions that were heard in areas like Syria. Are your sources saying anything about that, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2171.6000000000004s)]
*  whether there was anything beyond Iran? The unconfirmed reports are that there might have [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2178.48s)]
*  been some explosions heard in Syria and Iraq as well. I have not received any confirmed reports [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2184.48s)]
*  about additional Israeli operations tonight, Lana. However, we do know that over the past several [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2191.68s)]
*  weeks and months, Israel has launched direct strikes into Syria, Yemen, of course, Lebanon, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2197.84s)]
*  and I believe Iraq in order to strike Iranian proxy groups operating from those countries. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2205.44s)]
*  They focused on targeting missile, excuse me, weapons infrastructure, weapons warehouses and [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2211.6s)]
*  silos, as well as senior officials leading terrorist organizations in those countries. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2218.08s)]
*  So it would be wholly unsurprising if Israel did take those additional actions tonight in order to [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2224.4s)]
*  diminish the threat from Iran. This strike into Iran is just one part of a multi-prong strategy [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2230.72s)]
*  by Israel to diminish the threat from Iran and its proxies to Israel's security. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2237.9199999999996s)]
*  And it is worth noting that those are unconfirmed. What we do have confirmed at this point from the [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2243.2s)]
*  IDF is that they have taken strategic action, according to them, on military targets in Iran [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2248.7999999999997s)]
*  response, retaliatory, as you had said before, viewing this as a defensive action. And it is [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2258.48s)]
*  also worth reminding our viewers that in the moments ahead, there will be a lot of misinformation [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2264.16s)]
*  that will circulate online. We're already seeing some old footage circulating, so please be [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2270.08s)]
*  cautious about all that. We will tell you what we have been able to confirm and what we are trying [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2277.2000000000003s)]
*  to ascertain still in these moments. But Sam, one of the things that we do know is that this is a [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2283.36s)]
*  precarious moment. Talk to us more about the context of the stakes, where we find ourselves [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2289.12s)]
*  now more than a year after those original October 7th terror attacks that took place in 2023, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2296.88s)]
*  and where the primary actors are finding themselves in this moment in history. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2303.92s)]
*  Well, it's such an important question because during a moment like this, when there is such [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2310.16s)]
*  historic event unfolding, an Israeli attack in Iran in response to an Iranian ballistic missile [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2315.6s)]
*  attack, it is easy to lose the big picture here. The big picture here is that over a year since [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2320.8s)]
*  October 7th, there remained various tracks ongoing to try to resolve the conflict between Israel [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2327.04s)]
*  and Hamas in Gaza, the West Bank, as well as multiple efforts to diminish Iran's ability [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2336.3199999999997s)]
*  to strike into Israel. At the same time, there's a whole track focused on increasing humanitarian [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2342.64s)]
*  aid into Gaza in light of the dire situation there. So on the diplomatic side, Lana, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2348.4799999999996s)]
*  we understand that the CIA Director Bill Burns is traveling to the region to try to really [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2353.2799999999997s)]
*  reignite momentum for hostage release and ceasefire talks. There still are reportedly [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2359.8399999999997s)]
*  about a hundred hostages in Hamas custody, and efforts to secure their release have stalled. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2365.04s)]
*  So we have a diplomatic track focused on hostage releases and potentially a ceasefire as well. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2370.48s)]
*  At the same time, the United States Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State have sent a [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2376.24s)]
*  letter to their Israeli counterparts indicating that if humanitarian aid into Gaza does not [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2381.44s)]
*  increase to 350 trucks a day within now, I suppose, about three weeks, that the United States will [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2386.64s)]
*  diminish to some degree its military assistance to Israel. So that's happening as we speak as [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2393.28s)]
*  well. We also know that there are multiple efforts, both diplomatic and of course, military [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2398.8s)]
*  operations as well, to diminish Hamas, Hezbollah, and other Iranian proxies capabilities and intent [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2404.48s)]
*  to strike into Israel. There's a diplomatic track on that, but at the same time, Israel, of course, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2413.2000000000003s)]
*  is launching operations to strike those proxy groups, to strike their leadership, to strike [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2418.2400000000002s)]
*  their fighters, to diminish their communications and capabilities. And we don't really see an end [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2423.2s)]
*  in sight for those efforts by Israel to strike Iranian proxies in light of the incredibly [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2428.64s)]
*  virulent threat that those proxy groups strike. So many different pieces to the puzzle, Lana, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2434.3199999999997s)]
*  I've just named a few. The world is certainly watching to see whether there is really any pause [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2439.7599999999998s)]
*  in the actual violence unfolding, but there are so many different theaters where conflict is active [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2446.0s)]
*  right now that that's going to be a tricky, tricky nut to crack. And in so many ways, now [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2452.4s)]
*  these active conflicts are things that we are watching and reporting on, but they have been [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2458.8s)]
*  simmering conflicts essentially as long as human history has been recorded. So these are not easy [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2464.4s)]

*  Israel has launched its long anticipated retaliatory attack on Iran. Reports of [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2723.7599999999998s)]
*  explosions being heard in Tehran started around 2 30 a.m. local time. The attack is believed to be [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2730.64s)]
*  limited to military targets. CBS News has learned that the U.S. was given a heads up in advance of [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2736.64s)]
*  Israel's attack. That's according to a defense official. The U.S. is not directly involved in [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2743.6s)]
*  the strikes, but President Biden had been briefed on the situation. And in a statement, the IDF [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2750.4s)]
*  confirmed the strikes, saying in part, quote, like every other sovereign country in the world, the [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2756.96s)]
*  state of Israel has the right and duty to respond. Our defensive and offensive capabilities are fully [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2761.7599999999998s)]
*  mobilized. We will do whatever necessary to defend the state of Israel and the people of Israel. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2768.24s)]
*  Now, all of this comes after Iran sent a barrage of roughly 200 missiles at Israel earlier this [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2774.72s)]
*  month. That's what you're seeing on this screen footage from October 1st. The Islamic Revolutionary [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2780.9599999999996s)]

*  And it's also coming less than a week after Israeli military forces killed Hamas's leader [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2793.2s)]
*  Yaya Sinwar during operations in Gaza. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are proxies of Iran. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2798.4s)]
*  We are joined now by Courtney Kealey. She is a journalist who has extensive experience in [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2806.16s)]
*  the Middle East. Courtney, what do you make of this timing? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2812.32s)]
*  Lana, the timing really throws off any peace talks that were going to happen this Sunday. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2816.96s)]
*  Massad was going to be trying to work on peace talks. We've got the secretary of state, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2822.08s)]
*  Antony Blinken, in Israel as this is happening. The U.S. has tried their best effort to restrain [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2829.12s)]
*  Israel from retaliating at nuclear sites or at weapons sites or oil facilities. Meanwhile, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2836.72s)]
*  the Iranian foreign minister has been going across to the Arab world in recent days trying to get [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2844.48s)]
*  them on board in case Israel strikes. So it's not just between Israel and Iran right now. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2850.0s)]
*  Like you said, it's the proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah, which involves Lebanon and the Palestinians in [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2855.6s)]
*  Gaza. It also involves neighboring Saudi. And what their response? Will they support Iran on this, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2860.16s)]
*  or will they support Israel, or will they remain sovereign and push for peace talks? Lots of big [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2866.8s)]
*  questions. We really need to know where they struck exactly to see how big this really is, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2871.52s)]
*  how incendiary. And Courtney, on that note, the idea of statement says that it is conducting [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2879.36s)]
*  precise strikes on military targets in Iran, given some of the sensitivities and what we have heard [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2887.1200000000003s)]
*  from the Biden administration. How does that play into the request from the United States? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2895.36s)]
*  Well, it really does show that Prime Minister Netanyahu continues to be unfettered by U.S. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2901.84s)]
*  demands for restraint. President Biden has often called for restraint, saying that it could be [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2907.84s)]
*  a contingent on arms deals in the future. And this has happened in the past. But clearly, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2914.1600000000003s)]
*  this is a sign that Prime Minister Netanyahu and his cabinet, as well as his military, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2919.6800000000003s)]
*  are going forth with striking on Iran, which is in retaliation. But at this point, we've seen [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2926.56s)]
*  airstrikes and retaliation, airstrikes and retaliation. And the question is, is this one-off [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2933.6s)]
*  precision, or is this going to inflame the region even further and cause Iran to want to retaliate [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2940.64s)]
*  in a bigger way? So let's dive deeper into that, Courtney, because I remember back in April when [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2946.88s)]
*  we were, when I was at this desk covering a very similar story. At that point, Tehran launched a [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2954.08s)]
*  barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles targeting Israel. That was in response to a, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2961.36s)]
*  the embassy building in Damascus, the Iranian embassy in Damascus, being hit and killing three [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2969.92s)]
*  top Iranian commanders and four officers. At that point, Iran said that they were going to retaliate. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2977.28s)]
*  They did so. Israel then said that they would retaliate. They did so. And then it just sort [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2983.04s)]
*  of stopped, at least in terms of active weapons being fired between these two countries. Of course, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2988.64s)]
*  the proxy war continued. Do we expect now, because this had long been telegraphed, that Israel was [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=2995.8399999999997s)]
*  going to respond to these most recent barrage of attacks by Iran, that that will be potentially the [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3001.8399999999997s)]
*  end of this and things will go back to more of that shadow war with Hezbollah and Hamas receiving [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3009.2s)]
*  funding and instructions in many cases from Iran? Or do we expect that Iran will continue to retaliate [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3016.48s)]
*  more directly? Well, Lana, remember you and I were on the desk and we were talking about the death of [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3022.8s)]
*  Ismail Haniyeh when he went to the inauguration of the new Iranian president into Iran that was [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3028.56s)]
*  carried out on Iranian soil. And that was a provocation. Then there was the death of Hasan [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3034.56s)]
*  Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah and an Iranian proxy that definitely answers to Iran. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3041.36s)]
*  So we have been waiting to see after the latest ballistic missiles that were launched in Israel [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3048.6400000000003s)]
*  that were shot down with the help of allies, this would be the second time it happened. Now [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3054.2400000000002s)]
*  Israel is responding. So it continues going back and forth and back and forth. But Israel attacking [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3058.96s)]
*  Iran is unprecedented. It's not something people wanted to see. They wanted to see peace talks this [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3066.3199999999997s)]
*  Sunday, not waking up after Shabbat in the Middle East and in Tehran hearing explosions [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3072.24s)]
*  and the Israeli military taking responsibility for this. This is, it is a retaliation, but it's also [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3078.7999999999997s)]
*  a provocation. It is the middle of the night over in Israel and over in Iran. I want to play a little [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3087.6s)]
*  bit of sound that we've just received from the IDF. Like every other sovereign country in the world, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3094.48s)]
*  the state of Israel has the right and the duty to respond. Our defensive and offensive capabilities [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3102.0s)]
*  are fully mobilized. We will do whatever necessary to defend the state of Israel [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3110.64s)]
*  and the people of Israel. In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3117.84s)]
*  against the state of Israel, right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3124.08s)]
*  on military targets in Iran. The regime in Iran and its proxies in the region have been relentlessly [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3132.24s)]
*  attacking Israel since October 7th on seven fronts, including direct attacks from Iranian soil. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3139.7599999999998s)]
*  Like every other sovereign country in the world, the state of Israel has the right and the duty [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3148.1600000000003s)]
*  to respond. Our defensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilized. We will do [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3154.8s)]
*  whatever necessary to defend the state of Israel and the people of Israel. In response to months of [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3163.36s)]
*  continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the state of Israel, right now the Israel Defense [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3170.64s)]
*  Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran. The regime in Iran and its proxies [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3178.0s)]
*  in the region have been relentlessly attacking Israel since October 7th on seven fronts. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3186.56s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd. Sam, what do you make [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3193.52s)]
*  of that statement released by the IDF? Certainly trying to signal two things. Number one, that it [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3199.28s)]
*  will not stop its efforts to diminish Iran's ability to harm the state of Israel. Israel has [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3206.1600000000003s)]
*  been doing that by trying to decrease capabilities for Iran's proxy forces and by retaliating against [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3212.48s)]
*  Iran for their historic and unprecedented attacks into Israel itself. So the IDF is signaling that [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3220.5600000000004s)]
*  they will not back down from that mission. Number two, they're signaling that they view this [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3226.88s)]
*  as defensive, that these are not offensive moves, that these are defensive in nature. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3234.32s)]
*  They also specifically focus on the fact that they have struck military targets. They did not [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3240.88s)]
*  strike oil infrastructure or nuclear sites. They struck military targets. That is likely an effort [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3247.12s)]
*  to prevent this tit for tat from escalating further. Now, I will note, it is important to note, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3253.6s)]
*  that the White House has been supportive of Israel taking measures to defend itself. So while we have [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3259.52s)]
*  reporting that the White House asked Israel not to strike oil infrastructure and nuclear sites, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3266.24s)]
*  we do understand that the United States was supportive of Israel retaliating against Iran [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3272.16s)]
*  in some capacity. And it looks like the White House was successful in convincing Israel [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3277.36s)]
*  to limit its retaliatory strike to military sites. All right, Sam, thank you. Stay right there. I'm [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3282.96s)]
*  going to have some more questions for you, but we want to go at this point to CBS News' Chief [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3288.7200000000003s)]
*  Foreign Affairs correspondent and Face the Nation moderator, Margaret Brennan. She joins us now on [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3292.88s)]
*  the phone. Margaret, we're talking a lot about the context of these strikes and hope that it was [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3298.16s)]
*  perhaps going to, after the death of Yaya Sinwar, perhaps there was an opportunity for peace. It [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3305.76s)]
*  looks like this is moving in a different direction. Talk to us about the significance and what your [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3314.1600000000003s)]
*  sources are telling you. So this strike by Israel, the Israel Defense Forces against Iran, has been [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3319.1200000000003s)]
*  expected since that October 1st attack by Israel or by Iran on Israel. An attack that failed in its mission, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3327.28s)]
*  a attack that was intercepted by Israel quite easily with U.S. support as well. And that itself [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3335.2s)]
*  was retaliation for the assassination of the leader of Hezbollah. So this has been an escalation [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3342.3999999999996s)]
*  that was expected. However, within the context of what Israel was mulling over publicly, [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3349.9199999999996s)]
*  it is fairly limited. The IDF says it hit military targets, as Sam Vinograd was explaining, that's [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3357.52s)]
*  significant in part because President Biden went out and publicly said Israel should not hit oil [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3363.76s)]
*  installations, something that Iran vowed they would then go on to attack other oil installations [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3369.92s)]
*  in other countries, thus driving up energy prices. They were also publicly warned not to attack [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3376.88s)]
*  nuclear sites. Iran has a nuclear development program, but not yet a weapons program. And there [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3383.1200000000003s)]
*  has been concern that an attack that was so strong or directed at the nuclear program could [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3390.48s)]
*  actually trigger them to race towards a weapon. So those were all the things the U.S. officials [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3398.8s)]
*  were debating here as they helped counsel Israel on how to carry out a retaliation that wasn't going [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3404.08s)]
*  to further inflame the region but would allow them to walk away saying that they had struck back. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3412.0s)]
*  Now, we will see, get an assessment as to what these military targets were, how significant the [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3418.48s)]
*  attack is. But already the United States has in place equipment to help fend off an expected [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3424.72s)]
*  Iranian retaliation for what just happened. That FAD missile system, the anti-missile system [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3430.2400000000002s)]
*  that the United States sent also means America has skin in the game, U.S. personnel on the ground to [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3436.08s)]
*  try to help intercept. And that is also how the United States had some leverage here to this time [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3441.44s)]
*  get a heads up. This is important. The United States was given a heads up that this attack was [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3447.44s)]
*  going to occur in those recent attacks on Hezbollah and attacks on other leaders of proxy groups like [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3452.08s)]
*  Hamas. Israel has not been giving the United States more than a 20-minute heads up. This time, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3460.96s)]
*  the United States was part of that process, and that is significant. That is significant, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3467.28s)]
*  especially given the ways in which we know the Biden administration was frustrated by not being [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3472.72s)]
*  looped in on this. Margaret, given that this was expected that they were going to retaliate, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3477.52s)]
*  that it does appear at this point that it was limited to military targets, if all of that in [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3482.3199999999997s)]
*  fact plays out, do you expect a similar situation to what we saw back in April? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3487.2799999999997s)]
*  In terms of an Iranian response, yes, that is why that FAD system was put in place, but there are [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3493.2s)]
*  also backchannel efforts to try to limit the scope of that. Iran has consistently been shown [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3499.6s)]
*  to be 10 feet tall, as military officials have said to me. Iran's ability to execute an attack [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3505.7599999999998s)]
*  on Israel both in April, then October 1st, failed. They were able to fire ballistic missiles, but when [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3513.2799999999997s)]
*  they did so, they pretty much ran through their stockpile at that moment, 180 to 200 at a time. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3520.56s)]
*  That was, they were not able to make contact with the targets that they really aimed to, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3525.92s)]
*  at least publicly, vowed to hit. So they are showing themselves to be weakened. They have [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3532.56s)]
*  also shown themselves to have lost some of their proxy force leaders who they relied on strongly, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3537.92s)]
*  like the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. That was the most important proxy force in the [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3544.48s)]
*  region. When I say proxy force, I mean that's an unofficial militia, a military force for them [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3549.76s)]
*  in the region. So they are losing some of their ability to sort of stretch the long arm of the [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3555.68s)]
*  Iranian state through the region. Israel is feeling good about that, and the prime minister [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3560.72s)]
*  has been saying that they have really started to break away the hold that Iran's axis of terror [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3566.56s)]
*  groups has held on the region. But keep in mind, this tit for tat, this killing terror leaders, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3574.3999999999996s)]
*  this doesn't mean that it settles anything or that we're moving quickly towards peace. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3582.16s)]
*  I will note, however, the CIA director is expected on Sunday in Doha, Qatar, to be meeting with the [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3586.48s)]
*  head of the Israeli intelligence agency, the Mossad, as well as the Qatari prime minister. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3591.92s)]
*  This is one of those last ditch pre-U.S. election efforts to jumpstart any kind of process that [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3596.72s)]
*  would help free the remaining hostages in Gaza. But there is also a Biden administration effort to [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3602.56s)]
*  stop the fighting on Israel's northern border with what remains of Hezbollah. Despite Israel [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3608.96s)]
*  taking out the leader of that militia, it has not stopped the fighting with Hezbollah that has kept [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3614.2400000000002s)]
*  Israelis from returning to their homes in the north. So these are significant measures, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3619.2000000000003s)]
*  but they are not stopping what continues to be an expanding war in the region. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3624.7200000000003s)]
*  So, Margaret, just to circle back to the very first part of this, what are your sources saying [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3630.48s)]
*  then in terms of the prognosis for any additional peace talks? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3635.92s)]
*  Well, the CIA director Bill Burns will be in Doha Sunday. That effort at, it's not even really a [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3641.6s)]
*  effort at peace talks. It is an effort to free hostages that are still held by Hamas since the [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3649.36s)]
*  head, Yachaf Zinwar, the military commander who was also a political leader, was killed recently. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3656.24s)]
*  That just goes to show you, you can take out a terrorist leader, you don't kill the ideology, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3663.2s)]
*  and you haven't killed the fighting force. And that is the conundrum that the United States [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3667.9199999999996s)]
*  continues to press Israeli leaders that they need to confront. There's pressure on the Israeli prime [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3672.16s)]
*  minister to come up with his own vision for ending the war and withdrawing forces from Gaza. The [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3677.68s)]
*  secretary of state, Antony Blinken, was in the region until today really trying to pursue just [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3684.64s)]
*  that, offering suggestions and a plan and a proposal with support from other leaders in the region [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3689.6s)]
*  on who would go in and try to govern Gaza if the Israeli military were to pull back. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3695.44s)]
*  So, this has been a Biden administration effort. I am sure they will try to continue it after the [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3702.08s)]
*  U.S. election in the lame duck session, the remaining months of the Biden administration, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3708.72s)]
*  but at this point the prospects are pretty limited. It is widely known and the prime minister [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3714.7999999999997s)]
*  of Israel has acknowledged that he talked to Donald Trump. He has talked to him at least twice [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3721.9199999999996s)]
*  in the past few weeks. They are very much gauging what the U.S. leadership will look like and how [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3727.6s)]

*  Israel has launched some long anticipated retaliatory strikes on Iran. At this point [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3957.2200000000003s)]
*  it looks like it is limited to military targets. We're going to go to CBS News foreign correspondent [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3963.6200000000003s)]

*  about some reports of explosions in Iran just about an hour ago at this point. What more have [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3977.14s)]
*  you been able to learn? Sure. Hi Lana. Yes about an hour ago we did hear those initial reports of [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3983.8599999999997s)]
*  explosions coming out of Iran's capital of Tehran in addition to another city just west of Tehran. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3991.62s)]
*  The city of Karaj which is about 30 miles west of Tehran. And in that past hour we have had [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=3998.1s)]
*  confirmation from the Israel Defense Forces themselves from spokesperson Daniel Higary saying [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4005.86s)]
*  that they are continuing to conduct precise strikes on what he says military targets there [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4011.38s)]
*  in Iran. And that of course is important because how Israel strikes Iran will then dictate on what [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4018.6600000000003s)]
*  if any retaliation Iran might then do in response. We do of course have to stress that the U.S. has [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4025.54s)]
*  supplied a THAAD missile defense system here to Israel in the past week or so that is now up and [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4032.9s)]
*  running and that we understand had been put there in place in anticipation of any potential retaliation [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4037.62s)]
*  from Iran. And Remy it is currently the wee hours of the morning there in Israel. It's the middle of [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4044.7400000000002s)]
*  the night but it's also Shabbat right now 3 a.m. Is it surprising that this is happening right now? [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4054.7400000000002s)]
*  Is there anything more that you can tell us about the timing? [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4061.14s)]
*  It may be surprising from a religious aspect here. It is 3 a.m. here in Tel Aviv, 3 30 a.m. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4067.22s)]
*  in Tehran. But the fact of the matter is that this retaliation by Israel against Iran has been [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4074.8199999999997s)]
*  telegraphed for the past three weeks ever since Iran fired its some 200 ballistic missiles [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4082.5s)]
*  at Israel on October 1st. So the timing of this there was a comment from Israel saying [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4090.1s)]
*  that the retaliation, the strike would be surprising. And so to your question regarding [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4097.54s)]
*  the nature of the evening with it being the Sabbath right now this could be the aspect of it that [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4103.38s)]
*  Iran might have been taken off guard just a little bit perhaps thinking that Israel would not retaliate [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4110.1s)]
*  on the most important day of its week. It is worth noting though that it is the end of the [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4115.94s)]
*  holiday season there. Are we learning anything more Remy about potential damages in [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4121.46s)]
*  Iran, actual areas that were struck or is it just at this point too early to know that? [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4129.54s)]
*  Yeah it's too early right now. Again we heard only about an hour or so ago of those initial [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4136.98s)]
*  strikes but we have been seeing initial reports of explosions again in and around the capital Tehran. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4143.78s)]
*  There are unconfirmed reports that the headquarters and the barracks of the IRGC, that's the Iran [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4151.38s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard Corps, have been targeted but that's just initial unconfirmed reports there. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4157.62s)]
*  As the hours continue on into the early part of the morning and as daylight comes we will see what [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4163.54s)]
*  damage has happened in Iran and what if anything Iranian state media does report out on this. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4171.06s)]
*  But as we are right now at 3 a.m in the morning we're only hearing of explosions of reports, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4177.620000000001s)]
*  confirmation from the Israel Defense Forces but no reports officially of any damage in Iran. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4182.42s)]

*  This Israeli military response is coming after Iran launched nearly 200 missiles [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4454.280000000001s)]
*  at Israel. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4460.44s)]
*  Those missiles were largely intercepted that occurred earlier this month. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4461.08s)]
*  This also comes just a week after Israeli military forces killed Hamas leader Yachiyah [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4465.16s)]
*  Sinwar during operations in Gaza. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4470.28s)]
*  Iran as you may know supports Hamas providing the terrorist organization with weapons and funding. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4473.4s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Rami Inosentio joins us now from Tel Aviv. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4479.24s)]
*  Rami what can you tell us? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4483.4s)]
*  Major good evening there. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4486.679999999999s)]
*  Yes about half an hour ago we started hearing initial reports of explosions in Iran's capital [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4487.88s)]
*  of Tehran. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4494.52s)]
*  Several explosions in and around the capital also in the city of Karaj a city about 30 miles west [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4495.56s)]
*  of Tehran. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4501.88s)]
*  It appears to be home to an air base military air base there. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4502.76s)]
*  We're also hearing unconfirmed reports that the headquarters and the barracks of the Iran [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4506.76s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard Corps has also been targeted. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4512.76s)]
*  As you mentioned the Israel Defense Forces has released a statement from spokesperson [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4515.96s)]
*  Daniel Higary reiterating that they are conducting quote precise strikes on military targets in Iran [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4520.84s)]
*  and that is in response as they say to months of continuous attacks from Iran. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4529.24s)]
*  But they're saying that this is for defensive capabilities but in addition offensive capabilities [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4534.76s)]
*  have also been mobilized in the event of a retaliation. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4541.16s)]
*  Rami thank you please stand by. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4544.28s)]
*  CBS News senior national security correspondent Charlie Daggett joins us from the Pentagon [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4546.04s)]
*  trying to remind our audience what U.S. military posturing is in the region and what role the U.S. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4550.92s)]
*  military might play in what comes next after this Israeli aerial assault in Iran. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4555.96s)]
*  Yeah so Major this is a retaliation that the United States has been expecting and preparing [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4561.48s)]
*  for since October 1st. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4566.92s)]
*  There are a number of destroyers in the region and have been for some time that did play a [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4569.32s)]
*  role in intercepting the first barrage between 180 and 200 ballistic missiles but importantly [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4574.04s)]
*  they sent the THAAD system in. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4580.36s)]
*  This is a missile defense system and we all know how much vaunted the Israeli defense systems [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4582.28s)]
*  are but this fills a gap. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4587.96s)]
*  Part of the Israeli defenses were to my understanding and people told us here overwhelmed. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4591.8s)]
*  There are a number of missiles that got through those ballistic missiles. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4597.32s)]
*  What this does is it addresses that hole. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4600.36s)]
*  This is the first time you have U.S. boots on the ground in a combat role since October [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4603.4s)]
*  7th manning that THAAD missile system. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4607.879999999999s)]
*  It's got 48 interceptors ready to deploy. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4610.44s)]
*  It is in place as defense secretary Lloyd Austin has put it ready to deploy at any time. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4615.24s)]
*  It could go operational if the Iranians or when the Iranians decide to counterattack. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4621.08s)]
*  So that's already in place. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4625.96s)]
*  You have the destroyers in place. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4627.08s)]
*  You have a strike carrier carrier strike group in place. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4628.599999999999s)]
*  All of that has been in place since October 1st. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4631.88s)]
*  The THAAD system kind of beefs up that defense system. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4634.360000000001s)]
*  I'd like to please stand by at the Pentagon. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4638.04s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News national security contributor Samantha Vinograd. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4640.28s)]
*  So just to remind the audience there's ongoing military action by the Israelis in Gaza. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4644.76s)]
*  There has been back and forth military activity in Lebanon. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4649.16s)]
*  Now Iran. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4652.4400000000005s)]
*  This falls under the heading generally of escalation. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4653.56s)]
*  Samantha what would you suggest the audience pay attention to in terms of Israeli targeting [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4656.4400000000005s)]
*  and whether or not this might be the only response we see from Israel to what Iran has been doing? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4661.56s)]
*  Well Major Israel is certainly engaged in a multi-pronged effort to diminish Iran's ability [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4668.52s)]
*  to strike Israel in a variety of ways. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4674.6s)]
*  That's why Israel has been striking targets in Lebanon, Gaza, Syria and other places. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4677.400000000001s)]
*  This retaliatory strike by Israel into Iran is in response to Iranian escalation. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4683.400000000001s)]
*  I would point our viewers to the very carefully worded statement that the Israeli Defense Forces [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4689.72s)]
*  just issued in which they highlight the fact that they have retaliated against military targets, [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4695.0s)]
*  not against oil infrastructure or nuclear sites. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4701.320000000001s)]
*  This is a retaliation against military targets based upon Iran sending an unprecedented number [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4704.52s)]
*  of missiles and drones into Israel several weeks ago. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4712.6s)]
*  I will also note that Israel took its time in implementing this retaliatory strike. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4716.52s)]
*  They took their time so that they could bolster their own defenses with as our colleague Charlie [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4722.200000000001s)]
*  Daggett just mentioned the U.S. missile defense system and other assets as well as enabling the [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4726.84s)]
*  United States and other countries to ostensibly enhance protection at our own facilities in the [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4733.64s)]
*  region. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4739.4800000000005s)]
*  A big concern here for the United States is the safety and security of course of U.S. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4740.280000000001s)]
*  personnel in the region and just yesterday the State Department issued a threat advisory [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4745.16s)]
*  indicating an enhanced threat level against U.S. and Israeli targets. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4750.599999999999s)]
*  Overall Israel is signaling that this was solely against military targets and U.S. officials are [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4754.36s)]
*  certainly on high alert for any threats that may come to U.S. personnel overseas. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4761.0s)]
*  Major. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4765.96s)]
*  I want to go back to Charlie Daggett at the Pentagon. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4766.599999999999s)]
*  Charlie, not only have the United States military been a presence there for a very long time [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4769.16s)]
*  expanding it as you indicated, the Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, just left the region. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4776.12s)]
*  Tremendous engagement between the Biden administration and the Netanyahu government [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4783.32s)]
*  about this response. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4787.72s)]
*  Put that in some context if you please. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4789.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well Major, this has all been about timing, okay? [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4791.48s)]
*  So for the past three and a half weeks we've been waiting for the Israeli response, the [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4794.12s)]
*  Israeli retaliation. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4798.44s)]
*  Of course we didn't expect that that was going to happen during a time that the United States [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4799.879999999999s)]
*  Secretary of State was actually in Israel, but it's been hard to tell with the Israelis [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4803.879999999999s)]
*  because they haven't been giving a lot of advance warning for any of the attacks, any [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4808.839999999999s)]
*  of the military operations that they have undergone, even in terms of this building [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4813.4s)]
*  itself, in terms of speaking to the officials here. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4819.5599999999995s)]
*  So that has something to do with the timing, the Secretary of State being there, the death [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4822.599999999999s)]
*  of Yair Yassinwar, the idea that the hostage negotiations may be underway, they didn't [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4827.72s)]
*  want to necessarily interrupt or foil that. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4833.08s)]
*  He's no longer in, well in this specific region, so that may have had something to [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4836.280000000001s)]
*  do with the timing. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4841.320000000001s)]
*  And remember, just a couple of days ago there was that intelligence leak that came out that [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4842.12s)]
*  had U.S. surveillance looking at Israeli preparations for that. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4846.68s)]
*  That may have played into it too. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4851.16s)]
*  Charlie Dacodet, the Pentagon, also with our thanks to Rami Anasensio in Tel Aviv and Samantha [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4852.52s)]

*  Israel has launched its long anticipated retaliatory attack on Iran. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4886.84s)]
*  Reports of explosions being heard in Tehran started around 2.30 a.m. local time. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4891.64s)]
*  The attack is believed to be limited at this point to military targets. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4897.08s)]
*  In a statement, the Israeli Defense Force confirmed the strike saying, in part, quote, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4901.8s)]
*  like every other sovereign country in the world, the state of Israel has the right and [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJzqFuLNb4&t=4906.280000000001s)]
