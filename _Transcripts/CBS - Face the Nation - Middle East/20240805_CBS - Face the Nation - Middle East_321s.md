# Iran, Hezbollah could launch retaliatory strikes on Israel soon
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [August 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q)
*  There are growing concerns that Iran and Hezbollah could launch retaliatory attacks on Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  as soon as today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=5.8s)]
*  Iran has vowed to take severe action against Israel following a deadly strike that killed [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=7.82s)]
*  a Hamas leader last week in Tehran. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=12.46s)]
*  As a result of the possible escalations, the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon is urging Americans [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=16.28s)]
*  to leave the country using, quote, any ticket available. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=20.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, dozens of Palestinians were reportedly killed in Gaza after a new wave of Israeli [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=24.68s)]
*  airstrikes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=29.48s)]
*  The latest attacks followed ceasefire talks breaking down in Cairo over the weekend. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=30.66s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News foreign correspondent MTS Tayyab from Beirut. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=35.44s)]
*  So MTS, what is the situation there in Beirut? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=38.52s)]
*  Well, Lindsay, the mood, as you can imagine here, is incredibly tense. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=41.28s)]
*  In fact, the city of Beirut, which sadly is not a stranger that is unfamiliar with violence [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=47.88s)]
*  or the threat of violence or war with Israel, is quiet. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=54.4s)]
*  This is unusual for a city like Beirut. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=59.76s)]
*  Again, as we've been saying, it has this reputation of really being able to withstand the regional [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=61.68s)]
*  jolts. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=70.16s)]
*  And yet, as we've been saying, people going to the airport trying to get on any flight [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=71.16s)]
*  they can out of the country. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=74.84s)]
*  We have many people who have moved to the mountainous areas outside of Beirut as well. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  All of this over fears that Hezbollah will retaliate for the assassination of one of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=83.16s)]
*  its most senior military commanders, a man by the name of Fouad Shukr, who was assassinated [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=89.52s)]
*  one week ago today in Dahya in southern Lebanon, not far from where I am now. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=95.64s)]
*  Again, Hezbollah vowing to retaliate hasn't done so yet. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  But of course, the fear is not so much that when Hezbollah retaliates, it's how Israel [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=106.16s)]
*  And many are fearing that if Israel responds and how Israel's response could cause significant [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=112.06s)]
*  damage not only in southern Lebanon, where we've seen so much activity between Hezbollah [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=117.38s)]
*  and Israel really for the past 10 months or so, but that here, Beirut could also be targeted. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  Lindsay. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=128.98000000000002s)]
*  Imtiaz, it feels like we're talking about Iran retaliating against Israel and then Israel [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=129.98000000000002s)]
*  retaliating against Iran. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=135.06s)]
*  I mean, where does this end? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=137.38s)]
*  It's dizzying as it is frightening. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=144.66s)]
*  And that is really the question here. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=147.46s)]
*  Where does this end? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  We've been seeing for months now this tit for tat, whether it's Hezbollah and Israel [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  or Iran and Israel. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=157.7s)]
*  And as we know, there's this frantic diplomacy going on around the world trying to contain [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=160.22s)]
*  this, desperately trying to contain this, following those assassinations carried out [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=165.98s)]
*  by Israel here in Beirut and suspected in Iran. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=170.01999999999998s)]
*  Although Israel has admitted to the assassination here, it is not said that it is responsible [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=173.94s)]
*  for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh inside of Iran. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=179.29999999999998s)]
*  But most agree that Israel did carry it out. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=182.98s)]
*  Iran's saying that it is going to respond with a severe response. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=186.38s)]
*  And again, the question then becomes is how does Israel respond? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  But again, as we've been saying, that there is this intense diplomacy going around. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=194.17999999999998s)]
*  We know the U.S. is heavily involved, although it doesn't have direct interactions with Iran, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=198.1s)]
*  certainly doesn't have direct interactions with Hezbollah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=203.7s)]
*  We do know regional partners are really trying to de-escalate the situation. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=206.61999999999998s)]
*  The question now is will they be successful? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=211.06s)]
*  And if they are, how does this choreography that we've seen in the past play out? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=213.72s)]
*  Will Israel tolerate a strike from Hezbollah? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=218.77999999999997s)]
*  Will Iran carry out a limited strike against Israel, resulting in a limited strike from [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=222.3s)]
*  Israel itself? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=229.94s)]
*  Again, these are the huge questions that we're grappling with now as the region is really [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=230.94s)]
*  on a nice edge. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=235.82000000000002s)]
*  Kim Thiaz, you mentioned U.S. involvement in ceasefire discussions and diplomatic talks, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=236.82000000000002s)]
*  but what about militarily? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=241.66000000000003s)]
*  What kind of additional resources has the U.S. moved into the region? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=242.86s)]
*  Well, we know that the defense secretary has sent an aircraft carrier to the region [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=245.98s)]
*  and has really beefed up the U.S. military presence in the eastern Mediterranean. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=254.82s)]
*  And we've seen this presence kind of come and go over the months as tensions kind of [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=261.82s)]
*  rise and then fade away and then rise again. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=266.7s)]
*  And we're really at a very tense situation. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=269.53999999999996s)]
*  But again, this really underscores the U.S.'s concern that this tit for tat that we're [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=272.86s)]
*  seeing from Iran and its proxies with Israel could lead to an all-out war. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=277.14s)]
*  And the reason it's so concerning, not just for Israel, not just for Lebanon, not just [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=282.02000000000004s)]
*  for Iran and indeed countries across the region, is that the U.S. could be drawn into a major [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=286.86s)]
*  conflict here in the United States. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=293.18s)]
*  Of course, Israel, its most important ally, key ally in the region, despite the fact that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=295.58000000000004s)]
*  relationship between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu, as we know, is very tense [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=301.1s)]
*  right now that the U.S. would step in and defend Israel. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=306.90000000000003s)]
*  So again, as we've been saying, the real fear here is that this could escalate into an all-out [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=312.54s)]
*  war and draw the U.S. in. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXc02u7Y1Q&t=317.18s)]
