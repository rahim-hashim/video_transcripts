# Details on Trump's 2-week negotiating window for Iran decision
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s)
*  We're going to begin this morning in the Middle East, where Israel and Iran are trading new [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=0.0s)]
*  attacks as the conflict enters its second week. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=4.88s)]
*  And the White House sets a new deadline for Iran. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=8.24s)]
*  President Trump says he will decide within the next two weeks if he'll order U.S. forces [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=10.76s)]
*  to strike nuclear sites, leaving the door open for a diplomatic solution. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=15.32s)]
*  For more on this, I want to bring in CBS News' senior foreign correspondent, Holly Williams, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  who's following the developments from Erbil, which is in Iraq, very, very close to the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=23.0s)]
*  Iranian border. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=26.92s)]
*  So Holly, the president says he's going to make a decision on whether or not to strike [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=27.96s)]
*  on Iran within the next two weeks. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=32.88s)]
*  But as you know, two weeks in terms of what we're talking about right now, this ongoing [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=35.400000000000006s)]
*  battle between the Israelis and the Iranians, that's a lifetime. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=41.24s)]
*  So what do we know about the plans for Israel to try and dismantle Iran's nuclear programs [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=44.56s)]
*  before this two-week deadline? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=50.24s)]
*  Good morning, Vlad. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=54.52s)]
*  The destruction of Iran's nuclear program was really the justification for Israel's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=55.56s)]
*  attack and this war. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=59.36s)]
*  And the Israelis do seem to have made some significant progress. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=61.2s)]
*  They've targeted and killed several Iranian nuclear scientists. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  They've also hit several nuclear sites, including Natanz, where the Iranians had been enriching [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=67.68s)]
*  uranium up to 60 percent, a step away from the 90 percent that's typically used in nuclear [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=73.56s)]
*  weapons. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=78.56s)]
*  But experts say that all of those airstrikes are essentially in vain unless the Israelis [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=79.56s)]
*  can also take out the Fordow nuclear site, where the Iranians have also been enriching [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=84.24s)]
*  uranium. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=90.16s)]
*  They say if they don't, the risk is that the Iranians will be more motivated to get their [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=91.16s)]
*  hands on a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=95.8s)]
*  Now, the problem with the Fordow site is that it's not just underground, it's actually buried [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=97.36s)]
*  inside a mountain. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=101.36s)]
*  And the conventional wisdom is that the Israelis do not have the military capacity to take [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=102.88s)]
*  it out. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  So if the US does end up getting directly involved, that is what to watch for. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=110.36s)]
*  However, it is also worth watching out for some kind of innovative alternative solution [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  from the Israelis. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=123.72s)]
*  You may remember that back in September last year, Israeli special forces launched this [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=125.04s)]
*  kind of daring commando raid on a missile production facility in Syria. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=129.72s)]
*  Now, doing something like that in Fordow would be much, much, much more difficult. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  But do the Israelis have something like that in mind? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=141.32s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=144.48s)]
*  So let's talk about possible US involvement, Holly. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  Iran has warned of retaliation if the US does carry out any kind of strikes. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=150.16s)]
*  But what would that look like? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=156.6s)]
*  Are we talking about just attacks on our forces in the Middle East? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  Are we talking about perhaps terrorist attacks in major American cities? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=162.0s)]
*  What sort of conditions is the president and the administration weighing? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=166.56s)]
*  Well, I think bottom line, we don't know. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=175.8s)]
*  Iran has already accused the US of being complicit in Israel's attack and has threatened to retaliate [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=178.52s)]
*  against American bases. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  And there are a lot of US military bases scattered across the Middle East, including here in [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=185.76s)]
*  Iraq, as well as around 40,000 American troops. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  You may remember back in 2020, the Iranians actually attacked a US base or a base used [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  by US forces here in Iraq, al-Assad, with ballistic missiles. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  We were there a few days later. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=204.28s)]
*  We saw the extensive damage, although no American service members were killed in that attack. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  But now Iran has clearly been significantly weakened by just over a week of war with Israel. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=211.16s)]
*  Just to give you one example of that, Israel's military said today that overnight it had [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  more than 50 fighter jets flying nonstop over Iran's capital Tehran, and they were able [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  to target nuclear-related locations as well as missile production sites. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  So I think the big question now is, what kind of retaliation is Iran actually capable of? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=232.44s)]
*  And we're not sure. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=239.11999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=240.44s)]
*  Holly Williams reporting for us from Rabia, Iraq. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=241.44s)]
*  Holly, thank you very much. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  Stay safe. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=245.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  Let's get now to our Ed O'Keefe, who's tracking all this from the White House, and he joins [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  me now from the White House lawn. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=250.92s)]
*  So Ed, as you know, this isn't the first time, I've talked about this many times on CBS News [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=253.12s)]
*  24 seven, that the president using the verbal crutch two weeks, anytime he's asked a question [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=257.0s)]
*  about a decision he's weighing, I've often said that that's something that hearkens back [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=263.28s)]
*  to my days in finance. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=267.56s)]
*  When I was working on deals with clients, a client would ask me, when can they expect [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=268.92s)]
*  something? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=273.32s)]
*  And you always give the two weeks because it gives you a little buffer. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=274.32s)]
*  But what feels different about this, Ed, is that now the way that the press is reporting [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=276.38s)]
*  this these two weeks, it's almost as if it's a deadline. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=280.85999999999996s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=284.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=285.41999999999996s)]
*  And we've done that before on all sorts of issues, whether it was taxes and infrastructure [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=286.41999999999996s)]
*  or how to deal with ISIS in his first term, giving Vladimir Putin two weeks notice to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=291.64s)]
*  see how serious he was on ending the war in Ukraine a few weeks ago. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=296.62s)]
*  And that deadline came and went, or just saying last week that in two weeks, he's sending [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=300.02s)]
*  letters to everybody about how high their tariffs will be. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=304.66s)]
*  There are all sorts of examples. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=308.18s)]
*  This one, though, the within two weeks window is the timetable. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=309.78000000000003s)]
*  And a lot of it rides on what happens today in Geneva, where we have these talks underway [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=316.18s)]
*  between the British, the Germans, the French and the Iranians, where they're sharing a [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=320.3s)]
*  French proposal and where the British are reminding the Iranians there's an American [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=324.18s)]
*  proposal that essentially tells them if you really are just using nuclear fuel for domestic [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=327.8s)]
*  energy consumption, then extract all the nuclear fuel you have, send it outside your country [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=333.66s)]
*  and buy it if you need it for civilian purposes for someone else. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=340.34000000000003s)]
*  That's something we can permit. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=344.98s)]
*  The Iranians have signaled this morning they're not for that necessarily. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=346.38s)]
*  So we'll see where things go from there. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=349.5s)]
*  And you know, it's it's but you're right. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=351.86s)]
*  This is either going to be one of those things that peters out because the president changes [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=354.42s)]
*  the subject to other things or that he actually makes a decision on and announces. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=358.74s)]
*  And a lot of it rides on how these talks go in the next few days. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=364.94s)]
*  And whether, as Holly was saying, Israel is planning something on its own unilaterally [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=367.90000000000003s)]
*  that wouldn't necessarily require American support. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=372.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I'm old enough to remember that the president, then candidate Trump, promised to [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=374.78000000000003s)]
*  produce Barack Obama's birth certificate in two weeks. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=381.3s)]
*  It's been 10 years. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=383.98s)]
*  Still waiting. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=385.38s)]
*  But to serious matters. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=386.38s)]
*  I've also learned that the president is set to have a National Security Council meeting [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=389.58000000000004s)]
*  today. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=393.02000000000004s)]
*  I don't know if you saw that interview that Guardian White House correspondent Hugo Low [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=394.02000000000004s)]
*  gave to one on Steve Bannon's podcast where they talked about these bunker busters, Ed, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=399.70000000000005s)]
*  and that we don't really know. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=404.98s)]
*  They've done tests as to whether or not these bunker busters can penetrate that deep into [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=407.18s)]
*  a mountain. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=412.18s)]
*  But it's never really been applied in any real wartime situation. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=413.58000000000004s)]
*  The potential would be that you would have to use a tactical nuclear device. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=418.58s)]
*  So we know the president is meeting with the National Security Council. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=423.18s)]
*  Is he weighing these types of options at his disposal? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=425.66s)]
*  As we understand it, yes. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=429.58s)]
*  And remember, we've reported that he has already approved potential military attack [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=431.06s)]
*  plans. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=435.46s)]
*  That happened on Tuesday night. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=436.46s)]
*  We don't know what they are. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=437.46s)]
*  But they are, in essence, out there to be used if he decides to do so. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=438.5s)]
*  So it could involve dropping a or several bunker buster bombs. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=442.62s)]
*  It's weighed about 30,000 pounds. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=446.38s)]
*  It can only be dropped by the B-2 stealth bomber because we're the only ones that have [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=448.42s)]
*  an aircraft that can carry such a heavy and long weapon and drop it over that kind of [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=451.78000000000003s)]
*  a target. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=457.42s)]
*  So that's one option. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=458.42s)]
*  The others, of course, are to just merely support what Israel is doing and be prepared [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=459.7s)]
*  for potential attacks on American interests in the region or around the world. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=463.54s)]
*  The other thought here is that he's delaying this, and that's why he set the two-week [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=467.06s)]
*  timetable to let more military assets get into the region. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=470.42s)]
*  We've reported how jets are being deployed to that region, F-16s, F-35s. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=473.82s)]
*  The USS Gerald Ford carrier strike group is making its way towards Europe, which puts [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=477.98s)]
*  it closer to that region where you have two other carrier strike groups already. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=482.78000000000003s)]
*  It may just be allowing things to get in place. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=487.58000000000004s)]
*  And then there's the possibility, Vlad, that this is all a ruse, right, that he said two [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=489.62s)]
*  weeks but that really he could make a decision later today or over the weekend and surprise [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=494.42s)]
*  Iran after those talks in Geneva if they don't go well. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=498.22s)]
*  All of it to be determined. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=502.22s)]
*  This element of surprise is part of how the president operates and it's part of why the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  world is holding its breath, waiting and watching. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=507.62s)]
*  Yeah, no, you're right about that. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=509.54s)]
*  And I also note that we should note that we've learned, CBS News has learned that law enforcement [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=511.54s)]
*  is stepping up surveillance of Iran-backed cells in the United States. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=516.54s)]
*  Even as you know, the Iranians are meeting with some European diplomats in an effort [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=520.94s)]
*  to try and hammer out something, but the U.S. isn't at least formally a part of that. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=527.46s)]
*  No, they're not. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=531.34s)]
*  And again, that's where this proposal of potential buying nuclear fuel from another country [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=532.34s)]
*  but not making it, developing it within Iran is being proposed again or is being reiterated [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=538.9s)]
*  to the Iranians. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=544.58s)]
*  The French have an idea as well. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=545.58s)]
*  The Europeans more broadly may have proposals. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=547.7s)]
*  We're expected to learn more about it throughout the day. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=549.74s)]
*  And we should point out when it comes to those terror cells, these are possible domestic-based [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=551.58s)]
*  to Hezbollah, which of course the U.S. designates as a terror organization that ties to Iran. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=559.26s)]
*  No definitive proof yet that such a cell is here, but the FBI stepping up surveillance [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=564.98s)]
*  just in case. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=569.66s)]
*  They're not formally commenting on it. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=570.66s)]
*  The White House hasn't said anything about it as well, but it is underway. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=571.66s)]
*  All right, Ed O'Keefe on the White House lawn with some crucial reporting for us on this [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=575.18s)]
*  first day of summer. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=579.18s)]
*  Not a drop of sweat on the man. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=580.38s)]
*  Always looking good. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=582.26s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=583.26s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=584.26s)]
*  Ed O'Keefe, thank you, friend. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=585.26s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuEla9RC9s&t=586.26s)]
