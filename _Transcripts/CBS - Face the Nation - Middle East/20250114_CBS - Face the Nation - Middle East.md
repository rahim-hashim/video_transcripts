# What to know about the possible Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM)
*  Ceasefire negotiations involving Israel and Hamas are still ongoing in Doha, Qatar. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=0.0s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a potential deal is, quote, closer than it's ever been [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=5.4s)]
*  before. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=9.52s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Inosentio has the latest from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=10.52s)]
*  Remy? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  CBS News has learned from U.S., Israeli and Arab officials that the draft for a ceasefire [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  and hostage deal has been agreed to in principle. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=21.8s)]
*  And if it all carries on smoothly, then Israel and Hamas will finalize it this week. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=26.08s)]
*  Today, an Israeli government official here in Tel Aviv who wants to be anonymous told [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=31.64s)]
*  us the outlines of that deal. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=35.48s)]
*  In phase one, Hamas would release 33 hostages made up of women, the elderly, the sick and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=37.76s)]
*  some children in exchange for a higher number of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=45.08s)]
*  As for Israel's military presence in Gaza, that official said that assets, which we're [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=51.88s)]
*  understanding to mean military assets, would remain in Gaza and that the IDF would establish [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=57.36s)]
*  a security buffer zone between southern Gaza and Israel. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=63.24s)]
*  And as for the people of Gaza, humanitarian aid, which we know is so desperately needed [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=68.2s)]
*  now, especially at the height of winter, would be surged. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=73.48s)]
*  The latest number we have on the death toll is over 46.5 thousand people. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=76.76s)]
*  That just crossed the 46,000 mark only last week. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=81.84s)]
*  Pushing ahead to phase two, talks on that would start during phase one and with the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=85.92s)]
*  goal of releasing younger hostages and Israeli soldiers. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  But first, of course, phase one has to be agreed. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  If it does, implementation could start this weekend with hostages starting to be released. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  The last time that happened was more than a year ago. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=101.84s)]
*  But a reminder, we have been here before. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=104.48s)]
*  Many times talks could collapse at any minute. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  Many are cynical. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  But again, one more time, there is that feeling of hope and that official says in large part [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=110.64s)]
*  because of the U.S. and the double backing of the outgoing Biden White House and the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=115.88s)]
*  incoming Trump White House. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=121.32s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=122.96s)]
*  Ray Manosenso in Tel Aviv, thank you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=123.96s)]
*  For more, I want to bring in John Alterman. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=125.32s)]
*  He's the senior vice president and director of the Middle East program at the Center for [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=126.84s)]
*  Strategic and International Studies. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=130.2s)]
*  So John, at this point, because we know this deal is still so tenuous, what are likely [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=132.04s)]
*  the main holdups to a deal? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  One of the questions is who can actually speak for Hamas? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=139.32000000000002s)]
*  A lot of their leadership has been killed in recent months. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=142.84s)]
*  The other question is how many hostages does Hamas actually control? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=146.12s)]
*  They don't control all of the hostages. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=151.72s)]
*  And so I think the Israelis are wondering if they make this deal, are they actually going [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  to get people out? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=159.96s)]
*  I think one of the other issues, a question mark, and I'm not sure how much this is a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=160.96s)]
*  sticking point, but it's a question of how many people are actually alive. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=165.56s)]
*  And Hamas has said, well, we don't know. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=169.48s)]
*  We're not really sure. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=171.96s)]
*  I think this is one of the things these Israelis are really serious about. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=173.24s)]
*  If they're going to make big trades, they're going to be trading for live people and not [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=175.88s)]
*  for dead bodies. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=179.64s)]
*  So in that sense, does it surprise you that only 33 hostages would be released from Gaza [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  in phase one? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=185.64s)]
*  Well, this is going to include children, people over 50, and female soldiers. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=187.64s)]
*  That always was sort of what people were talking about. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=195.24s)]
*  Those were the easiest. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=198.2s)]
*  The male people of military age were always going to be a second phase. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=199.4s)]
*  The price that Israel is paying is 30 Palestinian prisoners for each Israeli civilian. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=204.2s)]
*  And for the female soldiers, 50 Palestinian prisoners for each one, including 30 Palestinian [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  prisoners who are serving life sentences. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=219.16s)]
*  This is a big deal for the Israelis. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=221.96s)]
*  It's very skewed. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=224.04s)]
*  They always knew it would be. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=224.84s)]
*  But this is a very complicated negotiation. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=227.56s)]
*  They've been having negotiations like this, as your correspondent said, for more than a year. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=229.72s)]
*  Would this be a permanent ceasefire? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=234.44s)]
*  This is not. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=237.32s)]
*  This is the first phase. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=238.04s)]
*  It goes to a second phase where they do exchange the male soldiers. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=239.56s)]
*  I'm clear what the price for that would be. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=244.2s)]
*  The third phase is when they start to get to something more sustainable. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=247.0s)]
*  What happens if they get through only the first phase, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=251.4s)]
*  if they get through the second phase, don't get to the third phase? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  There are a lot of things that could go wrong. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=257.32s)]
*  A lot of those terms aren't explicitly spelled out. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=259.96s)]
*  Even if we start moving in this direction, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=263.32s)]
*  things could easily fall apart and we could be back to where we started. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=266.04s)]
*  I mean, to your point, we've been here before. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=268.68s)]
*  I remember end of May is when President Biden first laid out his three-prong strategy here. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=271.0s)]
*  Does now feel different to you? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=275.96s)]
*  It feels a little bit different. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=278.76s)]
*  I think the fact that Trump administration is coming in, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=280.12s)]
*  that creates a certain amount of uncertainty. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=283.32s)]
*  The president-elect has talked about how he insists that everybody get home. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=285.64s)]
*  I think there's a sense that at least you know the terms [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=291.08s)]
*  and what the terms would be with the Biden team. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=294.04s)]
*  And there may be an opportunity to do something. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=296.2s)]
*  Again, to me, the biggest question mark is who actually can speak for Hamas [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=299.08s)]
*  and are the people speaking for Hamas able to control enough of the hostages [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=305.16s)]
*  to really move this into a different phase? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=309.72s)]
*  Okay, John Alderman, we hope you'll come back and keep us updated. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=311.72s)]
*  Thank you so much. Appreciate your analysis. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM4X-FHnebM&t=314.52000000000004s)]
