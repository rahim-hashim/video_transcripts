# Breaking down talks in Geneva over Iran-Israel war
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8)
*  So here we are Friday night, first night of summer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=0.0s)]
*  We dream of summer Fridays all winter long. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=3.12s)]
*  You have a happy hour, you crack open a cocktail, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=6.2s)]
*  you planned a weekend trip to the pool, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=8.96s)]
*  you open the grill. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=10.72s)]
*  Some people, not me, like the golf. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=12.48s)]
*  It's the start of carefree summer mode. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=14.96s)]
*  We've been dreaming about this. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=17.44s)]
*  It turns out this isn't that kind of Friday. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=19.0s)]
*  No time for cocktails if you're on the national security team. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=21.84s)]
*  And here in Washington and for the president, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=24.68s)]
*  there's little time for upcoming golf [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=28.04s)]
*  because it's not really carefree summer. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  It's not carefree summer season this weekend. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=32.4s)]
*  Today, there's been a summit in Geneva [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=35.56s)]
*  as Europeans try to find a diplomatic off-ramp [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=37.28s)]
*  to potential war in Iran. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  We're just 24 hours into a two-week timeframe [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=42.08s)]
*  for a potentially pivotal decision [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=44.8s)]
*  from President Trump on Iran, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=46.4s)]
*  which could push the US into a battle [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=48.96s)]
*  that President Trump has long said he wants to avoid. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=50.96s)]
*  He spoke a short while ago near the White House. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=54.76s)]
*  I'm giving him a period of time, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=57.64s)]
*  and I would say two weeks would be the maximum. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  Robert Costa reports Trump came up [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=64.6s)]
*  with that two-week formulation by himself to buy himself [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=66.28s)]
*  more time and see how Americans respond to polling. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=70.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, threats continue to menace public officials [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=73.72s)]
*  across the country. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=77.2s)]
*  A week after the assassination [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=78.36s)]
*  of a state legislator in Minnesota, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=79.76s)]
*  police today arrested a person suspected [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=81.48s)]
*  of threatening Ohio Congressman Max Miller, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=83.56s)]
*  a former Trump aide. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=86.96s)]
*  And this first official night of the summer travel season, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=88.8s)]
*  it is much less than spirited and festive [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  in certain parts of our country, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=94.88s)]
*  where the tariff war has scared off international travelers [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  and international business. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=100.32s)]
*  Not the summer we dreamt of, at least not yet, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=102.6s)]
*  but you can still crack open the cocktail, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  notwithstanding all that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  Let's start with the Middle East and those talks in Geneva. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=109.61999999999999s)]
*  We begin tonight with Liz Palmer, who's there. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=112.28s)]
*  Liz, pretty significant meeting. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=114.83999999999999s)]
*  What was your biggest takeaway? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=117.92s)]
*  What's the biggest headline? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=118.76s)]
*  Well, the session went twice as long as it was meant to. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=122.68s)]
*  It was supposed to go for two hours, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=126.52s)]
*  and instead it went for, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=128.6s)]
*  this was with the foreign ministers of Britain, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=130.32s)]
*  Germany and France, a representative from the EU, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=133.68s)]
*  and also Iran's foreign minister. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=137.2s)]
*  They huddled together, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=139.42000000000002s)]
*  they apparently broke into smaller groups, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=140.8s)]
*  came back together again, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=142.88s)]
*  and then gave a statement, not together, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=145.08s)]
*  the Europeans were together at the end, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=147.68s)]
*  and then foreign minister Arak Shi came out on his own. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  Let's have a listen to what he had to say. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  Iran is ready to consider diplomacy once again, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  and once aggression is stopped, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=161.36s)]
*  and the aggressor is held accountable [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=163.32000000000002s)]
*  for the crimes committed. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=165.32000000000002s)]
*  In this regard, I made it crystal clear [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=167.16000000000003s)]
*  that Iran's defense capabilities are not negotiable. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=169.0s)]
*  And he ended up by saying, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=173.0s)]
*  we are willing to meet again, to keep talking. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=175.12s)]
*  So that's a glimmer of hope. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=179.44s)]
*  This is the first diplomatic opening since Israel attacked, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=181.16s)]
*  and it's ended well in the sense [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=185.84s)]
*  that there may be another one. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=188.58s)]
*  If they're interested in meeting again, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=190.84s)]
*  and they're declaratively saying [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=192.44s)]
*  they're interested in meeting again, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=194.28s)]
*  does that mean they're trying to build a bridge [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=195.64s)]
*  for the US to be part of the next meeting? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=197.42000000000002s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=200.54000000000002s)]
*  In fact, the British foreign minister expressly said, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=202.18s)]
*  we want the US to come back into these talks. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=206.10000000000002s)]
*  The Iranians for the moment are saying, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=209.10000000000002s)]
*  we won't talk to the US until Israel stops bombing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=210.9s)]
*  But it was interesting when foreign minister Arak Shi [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=216.94000000000003s)]
*  spoke to the UN earlier. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=222.22000000000003s)]
*  He said, we feel betrayed, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=224.5s)]
*  we feel betrayed, diplomatically betrayed. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=228.18s)]
*  There we were talking to the Americans, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=230.58s)]
*  negotiating in what he called hopeful negotiations, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=232.86s)]
*  and Israel attacked. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=236.66s)]
*  So he characterized those talks as positive, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=238.52s)]
*  and that may be a little sign to the US [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=242.06s)]
*  that he has an eye toward coming back to the table. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=244.38s)]
*  But right now, the priority is stopping the Israeli attacks, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=248.06s)]
*  and maybe that's where Europe comes in. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=252.54000000000002s)]
*  They forge a deal that Israel can accept, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=254.86s)]
*  and then perhaps there's a ceasefire, a lull, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=257.62s)]
*  and the US can resume its role. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=261.1s)]
*  That's the rosiest scenario. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=263.42s)]
*  Liz Palmer in Geneva, thank you. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=265.94s)]
*  H.R. McMaster joins us now, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=269.5s)]
*  served as national security advisor [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=270.94s)]
*  in the first Trump administration. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=272.62s)]
*  H.R., what did you make of it [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=274.54s)]
*  when the president gave this two week timeframe [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=276.06s)]
*  for a decision? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=278.96s)]
*  God, hey, well, great to be with you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=280.98s)]
*  I thought it's the right thing to do, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=282.42s)]
*  to give the Iranians a chance [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=284.06s)]
*  to realize they could kind of save themselves here, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=286.29999999999995s)]
*  because there's really not a good way out [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=290.18s)]
*  for the Iranian leadership. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=291.97999999999996s)]
*  And of course, the attacks by Israel [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=294.82s)]
*  have been devastating, devastating to leadership [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=298.97999999999996s)]
*  of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=301.58s)]
*  as well as their nuclear and missile programs, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=303.38s)]
*  and some energy targets, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=305.94s)]
*  and also some of the mechanisms of control [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=307.02s)]
*  that the Iranian regime uses to repress its own people. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=310.46s)]
*  So they're in a position of profound weakness, Scott, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=314.16s)]
*  and Trump gave them a way [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=316.48s)]
*  to at least come to the negotiating table, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=319.08000000000004s)]
*  having made the decision that they're willing to give up, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=321.44s)]
*  they're willing to give up uranium enrichment, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=324.52000000000004s)]
*  which I think is gonna be a precondition [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=326.26000000000005s)]
*  for the negotiations, if there are any. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=328.20000000000005s)]
*  It's been noted the president frequently uses [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=331.08000000000004s)]
*  that two week timeframe for lots of things. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=333.04s)]
*  You were in the Oval Office with him [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=335.16s)]
*  when he made decisions. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=336.72s)]
*  Do you think he's being specific, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=337.90000000000003s)]
*  or do you think he's just using this as a crutch, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=339.56s)]
*  or almost a cliche of a timeframe? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=341.96s)]
*  I think he's being specific here. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=344.96s)]
*  He's probably looking at the degree [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  to which Israel can sustain the campaign. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=347.78s)]
*  He may be looking at time [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=352.0s)]
*  to get certain assets in place in the region, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=354.64s)]
*  or to evacuate some assets from the region. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=356.84s)]
*  I think there's a reason for that timeline, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  a number of reasons potentially for that timeline. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=362.35999999999996s)]
*  And of course, what he said is he could act before then. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=364.44s)]
*  And what you're already seeing is really a high degree [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  of Iranian intransigence with the interaction [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=369.12s)]
*  of the Iranian foreign minister [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=372.96s)]
*  with European foreign ministers today. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=374.68s)]
*  And I think the more we see of that kind of regime [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=377.44s)]
*  and transigence, I think the chances of the US joining [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=380.64s)]
*  Israel to destroy these deep buried uranium enrichment sites, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=384.96s)]
*  I think the chances of that go way up. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=389.56s)]
*  As we mentioned a few moments ago in the program, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=392.08s)]
*  the European leaders and the Iranian leaders are together. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=393.96s)]
*  They're in Geneva, they're talking, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=396.68s)]
*  having some type of diplomatic push. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=398.0s)]
*  Do you think something comes of that [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=399.88s)]
*  without the US as part of it? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=401.88s)]
*  No, I don't really think so. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=404.44s)]
*  I think this is an opportunity though [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=405.88s)]
*  for those European foreign ministers. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  And I imagine this is what they're doing is to say, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=408.97999999999996s)]
*  hey, the gig is up. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=410.4s)]
*  I mean, your four decade plus long proxy war [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=412.64s)]
*  has run its course. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=416.0s)]
*  Iran sort of backed itself into this corner. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=418.4s)]
*  The Iranian theocratic dictatorship had it pretty good [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=421.88s)]
*  for many years being able to escalate on their own terms [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=426.04s)]
*  as they use proxy forces to do their dirty work. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=429.64000000000004s)]
*  And this kind of strategy that was designed maybe [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=432.16s)]
*  to expend every Arab life, right? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=435.32000000000005s)]
*  To achieve their objectives of extending Iran's [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=437.48s)]
*  hegemonic influence across the region, surrounding Israel, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=440.64000000000004s)]
*  and then destroying Israel and killing all the Jews. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=444.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean, that's really what they were trying to do. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=447.36s)]
*  And to push us out of the region was kind of a first step [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=449.48s)]
*  to doing that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=452.68s)]
*  Well, that's failed now. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  Once they went directly at Israel in April and October [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  of last year, they opened the door. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=457.76s)]
*  And now they're kind of reaping the whirlwind here, Scott. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=460.24s)]
*  Well, you were in the room during previous discussions [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=464.32s)]
*  about Israel and Iran. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=467.26s)]
*  What do you sense is different now than was seven, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=468.52000000000004s)]
*  eight years ago when the president talks [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=472.16s)]
*  about Iran and Israel? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=473.88s)]
*  Well, I think the sense of urgency [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=476.08000000000004s)]
*  because of a number of factors. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=479.20000000000005s)]
*  One is the progress that Iran has made [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=481.48s)]
*  toward its nuclear weapon. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=483.6s)]
*  I think the other is where the kind of the feckless [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=485.68s)]
*  and ineffective policies of the Biden administration. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=488.12s)]
*  And the Biden administration chose not to enforce sanctions [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=492.68s)]
*  on the Iranian regime that helped them increase [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=495.52000000000004s)]
*  their stipends and invest more heavily [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=500.0s)]
*  in the ring of fire around Israel, including Hamas, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=502.44s)]
*  Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and especially Hezbollah. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=506.32000000000005s)]
*  They build up their proxy army in Syria [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=509.36s)]
*  during that period of time. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=512.48s)]
*  And they continued their work toward a nuclear weapon. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=514.28s)]
*  And of course, it's laughable sometimes [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=516.84s)]
*  when you hear people say, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=520.2s)]
*  well, I'm not sure, is it a peaceful program? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=521.2s)]
*  Hey, Scott, there's no reason to enrich uranium to 60% [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=523.96s)]
*  except for a bomb, anything over 20%. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=526.52s)]
*  And by the way, there are 23 nations in the world [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=529.84s)]
*  who have a civilian nuclear program [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=533.12s)]
*  who don't enrich uranium. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=535.0s)]
*  So I think all of those factors, the sense of urgency, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=536.24s)]
*  and of course, Scott, you've got to include [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=539.28s)]
*  October 7th of 2023, when I think Ayatollah Hamade [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=541.24s)]
*  was looking at Israel, was looking at the United States, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=545.76s)]
*  sensed weakness, and he decided to cross [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=549.4000000000001s)]
*  the destroy Israel task office to-do list. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=552.72s)]
*  And of course, he and Hamas and Hezbollah [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=555.6800000000001s)]
*  and the Assad regime, and now Iran directly, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=560.44s)]
*  got a hell of a lot more than they bargained for. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=563.72s)]
*  And just twice now, you mentioned the word urgency. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=566.9200000000001s)]
*  So let me ask this. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=568.8000000000001s)]
*  We have sources telling CBS News [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=569.64s)]
*  that law enforcement officials here [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=571.1999999999999s)]
*  are stepping up their surveillance [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=572.84s)]
*  of possible Iran-backed operatives who are here, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=574.1999999999999s)]
*  who are in the United States. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=577.52s)]
*  We all recall the assassination threats [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=578.64s)]
*  made against Trump administration officials [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=581.16s)]
*  from the first term. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=583.64s)]
*  Do you think that kind of surveillance pays dividends? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=584.52s)]
*  Absolutely, it's immensely important. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=588.64s)]
*  I mean, under the Biden administration, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=590.3199999999999s)]
*  they did a really poor job of securing the border. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=592.3199999999999s)]
*  And guess where a lot of Iranian terrorist activity is? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=596.16s)]
*  It's in the border regions between Brazil [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=600.0s)]
*  and Venezuela and other places in South America. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=605.0799999999999s)]
*  So it is very likely that Iran has seeded [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=609.8s)]
*  more of these terrorist cells in the United States. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=614.52s)]
*  And of course, they've had a worldwide network for years. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=616.76s)]
*  I mean, it went global in the 1990s. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=619.7199999999999s)]
*  Remember the assassinations that they conducted [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=622.48s)]
*  in Europe in that period of time, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=625.16s)]
*  the bombing of the Israeli embassy [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=626.44s)]
*  and a Jewish community center in Argentina in 1992 and 1994, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=628.8s)]
*  the blowing up of a Panamanian airliner in the 1990s as well, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=634.36s)]
*  abducting and killing US tourists and so forth. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=638.64s)]
*  So this is not a new threat from Iran. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=642.0s)]
*  And it's of course one of the ways [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=646.52s)]
*  in which Iran might seek to retaliate [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=648.48s)]
*  if the United States joins Israel [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=652.76s)]
*  in the attack on their nuclear weapons and missile program. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=655.4s)]
*  It's a lot to watch, watch there and watch here. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=659.56s)]
*  H.R. McMaster, have a good weekend. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=662.48s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=664.36s)]
*  You too, Scott, thank you. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGO2a184t8&t=665.72s)]
