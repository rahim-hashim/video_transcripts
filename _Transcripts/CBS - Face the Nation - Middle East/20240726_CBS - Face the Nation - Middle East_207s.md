# Trump says Kamala Harris' remarks after Netanyahu meeting were "disrespectful to Israel"
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM)
*  Former President Donald Trump met today with Israel's Prime Minister Atmar Lago. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=0.0s)]
*  Here are some pictures from their meeting. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=4.4s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu and Trump took questions from reporters in the room. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=6.92s)]
*  Here's the former president's response to a question about Vice President [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=10.6s)]
*  Kamala Harris's remarks on the war in Gaza yesterday. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=14.16s)]
*  I think her remarks were disrespectful. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=18.76s)]
*  They weren't very nice. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Retaining to Israel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  I actually don't know how a person who's Jewish can vote for her. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=26.0s)]
*  But that's up to them. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=29.840000000000003s)]
*  But she was certainly disrespectful to Israel, in my opinion. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=31.44s)]
*  CBS News campaign reporter Katrina Coffin has more from Palm Beach, Florida. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=35.84s)]
*  So, Katrina, how are Trump and Netanyahu framing this visit? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  So, Lindsey, I was in the room for that brief press gaggle that they had, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  and both men seem to be in very good spirits and frame their relationship [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=49.56s)]
*  as a positive one. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=54.64s)]
*  Trump denied that there were ever bad relations between the two. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=56.72s)]
*  He said that their relationship has always been good. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=59.76s)]
*  And then in sort of a cute moment, he said that the secret to his relationship [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=62.0s)]
*  with Israel was Sarah and hugged the woman next to him who was Netanyahu's wife. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=66.64s)]
*  But they presented a front of solidarity. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=71.88s)]
*  And Trump iterated that he feels he was the U.S. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=75.08s)]
*  president who has been the best to Israel and that that will continue. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=78.44s)]
*  Yeah. Well, can you dive a little bit deeper into that? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=82.44s)]
*  I mean, Trump said if he's not elected, quote, we're all going to end up [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=84.68s)]
*  with major wars in the Middle East. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  How could U.S.-Israel relations be affected if he were to win in November? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  Trump has been saying that he thinks that Israel's war with Hamas [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=95.48s)]
*  needs to end quickly. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=100.28s)]
*  He hasn't been specific about what that would be, but there is some indication [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  that he would be supportive of a stronger approach from Israel. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  During his first presidency, he was very pro-Israeli [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  in his stances and supportive of Netanyahu's wishes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=114.04s)]
*  Even today, he recalls how he moved the U.S. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=117.72000000000001s)]
*  embassy to Jerusalem, pulled out of the Iran deal and helped to broker [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=120.72s)]
*  the Abraham Accords. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=125.48s)]
*  So under Trump, I think that we will see a continuation of those policies [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  and of that support. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=131.88s)]
*  How typical or atypical is a meeting like this at Mar-a-Lago [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  with another world leader coming to Florida to meet with a candidate? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=139.12s)]
*  This is not a typical event. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=144.04s)]
*  Trump has been having some meetings and talks with world leaders [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=148.28s)]
*  during his candidacy. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=152.44s)]
*  He recently spoke with Zelensky on the phone. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=153.48s)]
*  He met with Duda. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=156.64s)]
*  But perhaps this is because Trump is a former president running for reelection. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=158.44s)]
*  But clearly, these world leaders see that he is doing well in the polls [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=164.04s)]
*  and they want to reestablish ties with him early and have these policy talks [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=168.72s)]
*  in the lead up to the election. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=173.68s)]
*  Trump is hitting the campaign trail this weekend. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=176.92s)]
*  What's on the agenda? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=179.48s)]
*  Tonight, Trump will be speaking at the Believers Summit. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=182.92s)]
*  This is a conservative Christian religious gathering. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  Tomorrow, he's heading to Nashville, where he's going to be the keynote [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=190.68s)]
*  speaker at the Bitcoin convention. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=194.28s)]
*  And then that evening, he will be holding a joint rally with J.D. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  Vance in Minnesota. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=200.04s)]
*  Katrina Coffin, thank you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=202.68s)]
*  Thank you, Lindsay. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97C2Rv7xKM&t=205.76000000000002s)]
