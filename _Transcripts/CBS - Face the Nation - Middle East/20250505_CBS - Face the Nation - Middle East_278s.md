# What Israel's plan to expand military offensive in Gaza could mean for remaining hostages
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc)
*  Turning our monitors to the Middle East, Israeli cabinet members approved plans to intensify [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=0.0s)]
*  its offensive in Gaza, and it includes seizing more territory and call up additional troops. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=5.86s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also promised to retaliate against Yemen's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  Houthi rebels after a missile strike briefly shut down Israel's main airport over the weekend. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=17.3s)]
*  The explosion happened near an access road injuring four people. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=23.22s)]
*  Let's bring in BBC correspondent Hugo Bachega for more on all of this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=27.42s)]
*  Israel says it will conquer and hold Gaza territories. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=31.660000000000004s)]
*  What could this mean for the remaining hostages? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=35.58s)]
*  Yes, I've got to say we haven't seen the plan. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=42.06s)]
*  There hasn't been any kind of official announcement following the approval of this plan by the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=43.78s)]
*  Israeli security cabinet. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=49.660000000000004s)]
*  We've had some Israeli officials briefing journalists with details of the plan, and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=51.260000000000005s)]
*  I think the key details are that this plan involves capturing and holding territory in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=56.5s)]
*  Gaza and also moving Gaza's population towards the south of the territory. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=62.46s)]
*  I think a few points here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=68.34s)]
*  First, there has been already concern being shared that this expansion of military activities [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=70.18s)]
*  in Gaza could lead to more suffering, more casualties in Gaza, people who have been displaced [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=79.1s)]
*  multiple times already. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=86.34s)]
*  We've seen also reaction from the families of the hostages who remain in captivity in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=88.58000000000001s)]
*  Gaza who say that this is a failed strategy, that military pressure hasn't resulted in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=92.82000000000001s)]
*  the release of hostages who are in Gaza, and they say that the government should reach [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=99.26s)]
*  a deal with Hamas for those hostages to be freed. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=104.9s)]
*  And I think lots of critics of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will also [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=108.22s)]
*  be raising questions about his true motives of continuing with the war in Gaza. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=113.9s)]
*  He has been accused by opponents of prolonging the war for political gains, to protect his [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  coalition government. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=128.24s)]
*  And I think a lot of people will be hearing words as seizing territory, holding territory, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=130.36s)]
*  and will be asking questions about the true objectives of the war in Gaza. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=138.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=142.4s)]
*  And Hugo, Israel is now promising retaliation against Houthi rebels. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=143.4s)]
*  So does this mean that we could see the U.S. intensifying attacks on Houthis? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=147.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think the image yesterday of a missile hitting near Bangor Yon Airport, which is [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=152.4s)]
*  the main international airport in Israel, was a surprise for many people because this [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=162.16s)]
*  is a country that has one of the most sophisticated air defense systems with a very high success [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=167.08s)]
*  rate in intercepting missiles and rockets. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  So the military said it was investigating why this missile wasn't intercepted. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=176.0s)]
*  Early findings of this investigation suggest that there was a problem with the interceptor [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=181.68s)]
*  that was fired. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=186.82000000000002s)]
*  But we've seen that, again, the Prime Minister has promised to retaliate following this attack. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=189.16000000000003s)]
*  And the Houthis are saying that these attacks are going to continue. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=195.98000000000002s)]
*  They say that they are acting in support of Palestinians in Gaza as Israel's war against [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=200.84s)]
*  in Gaza continues. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=206.88s)]
*  We've seen that there have been attacks already from the U.S. military targeting positions [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=208.38s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=215.54s)]
*  And I think it's very likely that these attacks are going to continue. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=216.54s)]
*  And I also want to ask you about airlines because some of them have stopped flights [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=219.57999999999998s)]
*  to Israel since the Houthi strikes over the weekend. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=222.62s)]
*  Can you tell us more about this? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=225.74s)]
*  Yeah, there has been a lot of disruption with a number of companies canceling flights, United, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=231.26s)]
*  Delta, Air France, Air Canada, British Airways, Iberia, many others. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=238.94s)]
*  So flights have been suspended, canceled as a result of these attacks. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=243.57999999999998s)]
*  And this is likely to continue for a few days now as these announcements have been made. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=249.94s)]
*  So affecting thousands of passengers trying to come to Israel or to leave Israel. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=254.7s)]
*  So the impact that this attack continues to have on the operations of Israel's main international [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=262.3s)]
*  airport. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=270.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=271.46s)]
*  Hujay Bachega with the BBC. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=272.46s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us on 247 today. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVuzTjHTxNc&t=273.78s)]
