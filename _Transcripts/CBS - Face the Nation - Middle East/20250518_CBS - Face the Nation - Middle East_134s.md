**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo)
*  The diplomatic discussions on the Ukraine war will continue tomorrow when President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump is scheduled to speak with Vladimir Putin and then-Ukrainian President Zelensky. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=5.44s)]
*  As Secretary Rubio mentioned, U.S. negotiators are also hard at work trying to get a ceasefire [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=10.72s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=16.32s)]
*  Our Deborah Pata reports on the situation there. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=17.6s)]
*  Since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stepped up the war in Gaza this past week, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=21.76s)]
*  most of 500 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=27.16s)]
*  For Palestinians, it is more of what they have endured with little respite for over [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=33.16s)]
*  19 months. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=39.68s)]
*  Relentless bombing in areas mostly reduced to rubble. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  A death toll that has seen dozens killed almost every day this week. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=45.96s)]
*  Israeli orders to evacuate, forcing Palestinians to pack up and move once again with no idea [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=51.88s)]
*  where they are heading to. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  More than two-thirds of Gaza has been declared a military no-go zone. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=61.24s)]
*  The rest is not much safer. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=66.08s)]
*  Israel has imposed a total aid blockade. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  For more than 75 days, it has stopped all food and medicine from entering the territory, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=72.34s)]
*  saying it is to force Hamas to hand over the remaining hostages. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=79.28s)]
*  Hunger is so rife that famine is once again stalking Gaza, according to the World Food [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=85.48s)]
*  Program's Antoine Renard, who's just returned from there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  You have around an estimated 14,000 children that are now facing what we call severe acute [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  malnutrition. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=103.6s)]
*  They could die without intervention. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=104.6s)]
*  But when famine is on, it's already too late. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=106.68s)]
*  That will be a failure of all the international community. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=109.04s)]
*  Doctors have told us they are barely able to treat starving children as they are running [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=114.4s)]
*  out of supplies because of the blockade. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=119.68s)]
*  A global hunger monitor says already half a million are on the brink of starvation, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=123.48s)]
*  and a million more have barely enough food to survive. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Thi5K0bo&t=129.68s)]
