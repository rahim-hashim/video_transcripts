# President Trump meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over ceasefire proposal
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was back at the White House today for another [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=0.0s)]
*  round of talks with President Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=4.68s)]
*  The meeting comes as the White House is pushing for a new ceasefire deal between Israel and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=6.48s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=11.48s)]
*  The White House says Steve Witkoff, the administration's special envoy to the Middle East, will travel [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=12.48s)]
*  to Doha later this week, where a new round of peace talks is taking place. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=17.6s)]
*  During a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, President Trump spoke about the efforts toward a ceasefire. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=22.8s)]
*  We're going to be talking about, I would say, almost exclusively Gaza. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=27.56s)]
*  We've got to get that solved. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=32.64s)]
*  Gaza is a tragic, it's a tragedy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=34.2s)]
*  It's a tragedy. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=37.76s)]
*  And he wants to get it solved, and I want to get it solved. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=39.379999999999995s)]
*  And I think the other side wants to get it solved. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=41.96s)]
*  Joining us now is CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=45.44s)]
*  And Aaron, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=48.44s)]
*  What do we know about the prime minister's meeting with the president today? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=50.0s)]
*  Nancy, we know that Prime Minister Netanyahu got to the White House campus about an hour [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  and a half ago. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  And during that Cabinet meeting, President Trump framed this as a discussion exclusively [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=59.12s)]
*  focused on Gaza, on getting Hamas, in a sense, to accept that 60-day ceasefire proposal. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=63.18s)]
*  And there hasn't been anything concrete that's been accepted yet. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=70.44s)]
*  But the indications and signs from President Trump, from White House special envoy Steve [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=73.16s)]
*  Witkoff, is that there is progress, or at least they are pushing for progress to happen [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=77.88s)]
*  soon and this week. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=82.24s)]
*  Witkoff told reporters he's still hopeful for a deal on the ceasefire by the end of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=84.12s)]
*  this week, said that the talks are now down to, quote, just one issue between Israel and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=89.02s)]
*  Hamas, down from four. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=94.1s)]
*  And Witkoff did not specify what the outstanding issue is, but from what we understand about [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=95.78s)]
*  the framework of the deal on the table is that there are conditions and talks about [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=100.86s)]
*  what the withdrawal of Israeli troops looks like from Gaza, the release and swaps of hostages, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=105.38s)]
*  as well as how aid will get into Gaza. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=112.58s)]
*  And Aaron, going back to today's Cabinet meeting, the president said he might soon be sending [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=114.74s)]
*  more tariff letters to the European Union as he tries to secure new trade agreements. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=118.3s)]
*  What's the latest there? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=123.86s)]
*  Yeah, the president said that while talks seem to be going well with the European Union, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=124.86s)]
*  that the U.S. is likely, quote, two days away from sending them a tariff letter. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=130.54s)]
*  And he overall framed these tariff letters as a deal in their own right because he said [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=136.57999999999998s)]
*  that the U.S. is less than what they are charging the U.S. for American exports. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=142.78s)]
*  It is less than what, in his eyes, what will balance the trade deficit between the U.S. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=146.26s)]
*  and these other countries. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=152.5s)]
*  But also on tariffs, the president announced that there would be a 50 percent tariff on [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=153.94s)]
*  copper matching the current rates the U.S. has on steel and aluminum. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=158.1s)]
*  That could become official within a couple days, according to White House officials. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=162.29999999999998s)]
*  The president also again floated a 200 percent tariff on pharmaceuticals, though he noted [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=166.98000000000002s)]
*  that there may be a year or more for companies abroad to move into the U.S. and manufacture [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=172.58s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=181.22s)]
*  And Aaron, I want to ask you also about Ukraine. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=182.22s)]
*  The president made a reversal this week, saying the U.S. would send more weapons to Ukraine [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=184.58s)]
*  after the Pentagon announced it had halted deliveries. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=188.86s)]
*  So what is behind that shift? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=192.18s)]
*  What do we know about what's being sent right now? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=194.5s)]
*  Yeah, you saw signs of this as well last week, where President Trump showed disappointment [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=196.66s)]
*  with recent Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=202.42s)]
*  Last Thursday, he seemed frustrated that a call with Russian President Putin did not [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=206.45999999999998s)]
*  result in any progress when it comes to ending the war between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=209.98s)]
*  And today, during his cabinet meeting, President Trump said that President Putin is, quote, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=214.5s)]
*  willing to many people, and thus he's approved more weapons to help Ukraine defend themselves. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=219.3s)]
*  We saw the Pentagon put out a statement last night saying that at the direction of President [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=224.42000000000002s)]
*  Trump, they are sending Ukraine additional defensive weapons, though there is one interesting [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=229.10000000000002s)]
*  point to watch in that the pause that initially came last week were on weapons that were approved [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=234.10000000000002s)]
*  to be sent to Ukraine by the Biden administration. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=239.66000000000003s)]
*  So we're looking to see if the Trump administration will add any on top of that, especially as [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=242.5s)]
*  President Trump is expressing his displeasure with President Putin. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=247.22s)]
*  Much more to come on that, Aaron Navarro. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xVYvd0cimA&t=252.38s)]
