# Is Iran in a vulnerable position?
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM)
*  Iran hits back at Israel as long running tensions between the two countries escalate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=0.0s)]
*  The Iranian military launched dozens of missiles at the coastal city of Tel Aviv earlier today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=5.32s)]
*  Israel says many were intercepted by its anti-missile defense system known as the Iron Dome. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=10.6s)]
*  At least 21 people were injured. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=16.2s)]
*  The attack comes one day after Israel launched a series of strikes across Iranian territory, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=18.04s)]
*  including the capital city of Tehran. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=22.8s)]
*  Israel says it's targeting Iran's nuclear sites, including research facilities as a [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=25.0s)]
*  way to ensure the country can never develop a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=29.8s)]
*  Israel also said it killed several top Iranian military generals as part of the operation. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=33.36s)]
*  Earlier Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a message directed at the Iranian [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=38.84s)]
*  people. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=43.72s)]
*  Tonight, I wish to speak to you, the proud people of Iran. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=44.72s)]
*  We're in the midst of one of the greatest military operations in history. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=49.36s)]
*  And as we achieve our objectives, we're also clearing the path for you to achieve your [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=54.68s)]
*  objective, which is freedom. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=60.84s)]
*  Now it's unclear how the Iranian public will receive the Prime Minister's message. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=64.4s)]
*  Earlier in Tehran, protesters took to the streets with some chanting, death to Israel. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=69.0s)]
*  In a televised address, Iran's supreme leader promised a fierce response to the Israeli [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=73.58s)]
*  attack saying, quote, they started this and triggered a war. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=78.72s)]
*  We will not allow them to walk away unscathed from the great crime they have committed. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=82.04s)]
*  And CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd joins us now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=87.54s)]
*  Sam, good to see you. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=91.0s)]
*  So Israel struck Iran at a time when Iranian proxy groups Hamas and Hezbollah are both [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  severely weakened. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  How vulnerable does that leave Iran at this moment and what options does Iran have moving [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=99.0s)]
*  forward? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, leaving aside the state of Hezbollah, Hamas and other Iranian proxies throughout [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  the region, it is also worth noting that Iranian air defenses within Iran itself were damaged [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=110.84s)]
*  when Israel struck Iran several months ago. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  So the country of Iran itself is more vulnerable than it had been before Israel struck previously. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=120.44s)]
*  At the same time, Israel, over the last year or so, has launched assassinations within [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=127.12s)]
*  Iran itself against senior officials, as well as a range of covert action programs. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=132.20000000000002s)]
*  Iran is certainly more vulnerable than it has been before. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=137.68s)]
*  That said, it is worth noting that when it comes to capabilities, Iran still retains [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=141.6s)]
*  a vast proxy network around the world. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=147.16s)]
*  Its proxies, the Houthis, for example, are still quite active. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=150.64s)]
*  And Iran does have significant nuclear capabilities and cyber capabilities that could be activated. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=154.48s)]
*  Now, those nuclear capabilities were decreased due to these Israeli strikes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=160.76s)]
*  We're still waiting for the battlefield assessment when it comes to Iranian nuclear stockpiles [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=166.48s)]
*  and attacks on nuclear sites. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  But Iran was closer to a nuclear weapon before these Israeli strikes than it ever was before. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=173.24s)]
*  We have seen that Israel has considered these strikes that they carried out against Iran [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=180.12s)]
*  as somewhat of a success. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=186.0s)]
*  So Israel says it wants to destroy Iran's nuclear program. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=187.96s)]
*  How much did the initial strikes accomplish and how much further will Israel need to go [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=190.92s)]
*  in order to reach that goal? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=194.84s)]
*  Well, we're still waiting for what we call a battlefield assessment. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  Israel has indicated that it did not just strike Natanz, which is Iran's main enrichment [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=200.88s)]
*  facility, where it had a significant stockpile of highly enriched uranium. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=206.2s)]
*  But Israel also assassinated key nuclear scientists. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  So we do know that the program was impacted seriously. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=213.68s)]
*  What we don't know is whether the additional sites that were struck suffered very significant [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=217.28s)]
*  damage that set the program back by a significant amount of time. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=222.44s)]
*  By all accounts, Iran had enough highly enriched uranium to make about 10 nuclear weapons if [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=227.0s)]
*  it chose to break out to a bomb. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=235.0s)]
*  It could have done that in a matter of weeks just based upon the level at which it had [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=237.8s)]
*  enriched uranium. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=242.48s)]
*  But we do have to wait for a bit, at least, to see how significantly Israel did set back [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=243.48s)]
*  the program. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=249.12s)]
*  But certainly striking Natanz and assassinating these nuclear scientists was a serious blow. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=250.12s)]
*  Seeing these volleys of missiles and strikes back and forth, a ton of people out there [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  are wondering at this point, are there any indications this could expand into a larger [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=259.24s)]
*  regional conflict? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=264.08s)]
*  That is always a concern when it comes to Iran. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=266.92s)]
*  Dating back to my first time in government under the Bush administration when I served [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=269.56s)]
*  in Iraq and Iran activated its proxies all the way through to the current day. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=273.16s)]
*  Whenever Iran and Israel are at odds, there is concern that this could spark a larger [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=278.56s)]
*  regional war that could draw in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza, the West Bank, and elsewhere. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  We should note that Iran has proxies actually globally. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  Iran's proxies have launched attacks literally in Asia, Western Hemisphere, United States, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=294.2s)]
*  and elsewhere. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=300.56s)]
*  This is not just about the potential for regional instability, but more broadly, Tom, there's [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=301.56s)]
*  potential for global instability as well, as well as very real security concerns here [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=306.12s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=310.76000000000005s)]
*  If Iran does seek to activate its proxies or to try to inspire individuals to act against [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=312.36s)]
*  United States or U.S. interests. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=317.52000000000004s)]
*  Some potentially far reaching implications if things continue to escalate. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=319.88s)]
*  Sam Vinograd, we always appreciate your analysis. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  And CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro joins us now. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=327.08000000000004s)]
*  So Aaron, good to see you. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=330.16s)]
*  How is President Trump reacting to the strikes between Israel and Iran? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=331.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, at least militarily, we know per reporting from our colleagues, Ellie Watson, Jennifer [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=336.32s)]
*  Jacobs, that U.S. officials say that U.S. ground-based air defense systems and the ship [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=341.68s)]
*  have helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles that came earlier this afternoon Eastern time. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=347.2s)]
*  And they were successful in at least intercepting one of those missiles. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=353.2s)]
*  We have not heard directly from President Trump reacting to these missiles launched [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  by Iran. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=363.12s)]
*  We did see earlier today a U.S. State Department official said at a U.N. Security Council emergency [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=364.52s)]
*  briefing as Iran was striking Israel, where he repeated Secretary of State Marco Rubio's [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=370.7s)]
*  comments that Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel and that if it did [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=376.76s)]
*  so, quote, the consequences for Iran would be dire. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=381.24s)]
*  We know that President Trump in the morning before Iran's missile strikes called Israel's [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=385.14s)]
*  strikes on Iran, quote, excellent, seemed to signal that there's more to come from [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=391.36s)]
*  Israel. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=395.6s)]
*  He touted that Israel used American equipment in their strikes on Iran and said to CNN, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=396.6s)]
*  quote, we, of course, support Israel. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=402.72s)]
*  We also know, lastly, that President Trump has spoken to many foreign leaders throughout [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=405.64s)]
*  the day, such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier in the morning. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  He also talked to the Crown Prince in Saudi Arabia, where they discussed this back and [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=414.88s)]
*  forth between Israel and Iran that we're seeing play out. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=420.32s)]
*  You know, Aaron, when we look at the strikes that Israel carried out, they were highly [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=423.12s)]
*  targeted, taking out top military officials, top nuclear scientists. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=429.96s)]
*  So how much was the White House aware of this Israeli operation beforehand, if at all? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=436.8s)]
*  We're getting some mixed messages so far from the White House. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=443.8s)]
*  If you recall last night when Israel was launching their strikes, the statement from the White [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=445.86s)]
*  House was from Secretary of State Rubio, where he said that the U.S. is not involved in these [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=450.44s)]
*  strikes against Iran. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=455.0s)]
*  In interviews this morning, President Trump touted that Israel used American equipment [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=456.88s)]
*  in their strikes. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=462.0s)]
*  And in two separate interviews, President Trump said this. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=463.2s)]
*  And one, he said, quote, he knew everything about Israel's strikes and tried to, quote, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  save Iran through a nuclear deal before Israel launched. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=470.79999999999995s)]
*  And in another interview, he said he did not get a specific heads up from Israel, but knew [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=474.47999999999996s)]
*  what was going on. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=479.76s)]
*  Our reporting from our colleagues Margaret Brennan, James Laporta, is that President [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=481.08s)]
*  Trump was aware of the impending strike, but did not explicitly greenlight Israel to launch [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=485.52s)]
*  those attacks according to multiple sources. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=491.35999999999996s)]
*  So this dramatic escalation between Israel and Iran happens to the backdrop of those [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  critical nuclear talks that were expected to happen this Sunday. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=498.52s)]
*  Are those talks still happening? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=501.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=504.52s)]
*  Several U.S. officials tell CBS News that special envoy Steve Witkoff still intends [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=505.84s)]
*  to do that six round of talks in the coming days with Iranian officials, still to be determined [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  where that exactly would happen, what that exactly looks like. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  Trump portrayed it as Iran, quote, having a second chance. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=518.88s)]
*  But a Iranian foreign minister said today that Israeli aggression against Iran has, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  quote, diverted the course of diplomacy. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=526.4s)]
*  So it remains to be seen whether Iran wants to come back to the negotiating table as the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=529.04s)]
*  Trump administration is looking to do. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=532.8399999999999s)]
*  We're going to hear from Senator Navarro with the updates coming from the White House. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=535.0s)]
*  Erin, thank you. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=538.4399999999999s)]
*  CBS News Pentagon reporter Eleanor Watson joins me now. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=539.4399999999999s)]
*  Eleanor, good to see you. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  So how is the Pentagon responding to the heightened tensions in the region, especially given there [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=542.88s)]
*  are American troops stationed in nearby Iraq and Syria? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=547.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=551.16s)]
*  So today we saw the first round of what many were worried about of retaliation from Iran. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=552.16s)]
*  The retaliation from Iran was against Israel, and the U.S. did help using ground-based air [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=557.9599999999999s)]
*  and ballistic missile systems and at least one Navy warship. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=564.0s)]
*  The U.S. Navy has two destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean near Israel armed with ballistic [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=566.56s)]
*  missile defense systems and this morning directed a third to head from the western Mediterranean [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=571.68s)]
*  east to be closer to Israel. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=576.4399999999999s)]
*  U.S. bases in both Iraq and Syria are also on heightened alert in case Iran follows through [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=578.6s)]
*  on its vow to not only retaliate against Israel, but also to retaliate against the U.S. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=584.48s)]
*  As Erin mentioned, the U.S. message at the United Nations today was that any attack on [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=590.72s)]
*  Americans in the region would be met with, quote, dire consequences. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=596.28s)]
*  So it appears that any attack on U.S. bases, even if it doesn't cause casualties, could [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=600.28s)]
*  be met with retaliation from the United States. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=606.68s)]
*  Yeah, we know that some troops in the region had to seek shelter just hours ago. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=609.28s)]
*  Ellie, while I have you, I also want to ask you about Saturday's military parade celebrating [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=613.4s)]
*  the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=617.8000000000001s)]
*  What are we expecting to see tomorrow? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=620.6800000000001s)]
*  A lot of everything ranging from soldiers dressed in revolutionary war uniforms to the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=623.6s)]
*  Army's main battle tanks, which weigh in at 80 tons apiece. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=630.0s)]
*  Nearly 7,000 soldiers will march along Constitution Avenue from the Lincoln Memorial to the Washington [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=634.32s)]
*  Monument passing the White House where President Trump on his 79th birthday will be watching [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=640.1600000000001s)]
*  from a reviewing stand. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=645.0s)]
*  Army and White House officials are monitoring the weather, which as of now is forecasted [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=647.58s)]
*  to lightly rain on the parade. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=651.4s)]
*  Officials tell us that the only thing that could delay the show that President Trump [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=654.52s)]
*  has wanted since his first term would be if there are thunderstorms. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=659.8s)]
*  Eleanor Watson, we appreciate your time. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=663.8199999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfuCk_hoSuM&t=665.98s)]
