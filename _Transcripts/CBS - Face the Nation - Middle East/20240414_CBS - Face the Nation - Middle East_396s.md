# Israel's response to Iran should have "definable" beginning and end, Gen. Frank McKenzie says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w)
*  We're going to go now to the former commander for US Central Command, General Frank McKenzie, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=0.0s)]
*  who is also the author of a new book, The Melting Point, available in June. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=4.28s)]
*  General, welcome back to Face the Nation. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=9.9s)]
*  Given what you just saw play out in the last 24 hours, I wonder if you think that deterrence [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=15.24s)]
*  has been reestablished. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=23.06s)]
*  And on the spectrum of options that Iran had before it, how big did it go last night? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=25.94s)]
*  First of all, good to see you, Margaret. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=34.02s)]
*  I think this was a big attack by Iran. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=35.74s)]
*  I think this was as close to a maximum effort as they could generate, and I'll illustrate [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=38.34s)]
*  it in this way. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=42.14s)]
*  Iran has over 3,000 missiles of various types scattered around the country. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=43.14s)]
*  They have about 100, probably a little more than that, missiles largely in western Iran [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=48.86s)]
*  that can target Israel. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=53.7s)]
*  Based on what the Israelis are saying, I believe they fired most of those weapons at Israel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=55.900000000000006s)]
*  The Israelis obviously were able to intercept most of them. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=60.540000000000006s)]
*  Iran could not replicate last night's attack tonight if they had to. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  Now they also used cruise missiles and they used drones to try to present a multi-dimensional [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=68.62s)]
*  problem to the Israelis. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=73.94s)]
*  It was a maximum effort. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=75.72s)]
*  Now the Iranians are going to backtrack and talk about moderation. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=76.76s)]
*  There was nothing moderate about this attack, and I think John Kirby nailed it precisely [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=79.82s)]
*  when he was talking to you earlier about the nature and scope of the Iranian attack. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=84.25999999999999s)]
*  It was indiscriminate and it was designed to cause casualties, so we should just consider [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=88.32s)]
*  that as we take a look at it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=92.41999999999999s)]
*  Now has the terrorists been reset? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=94.1s)]
*  I think the Israelis performed magnificently with our assistance and the assistance of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=96.06s)]
*  other nations in the region, including the United Kingdom. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=100.06s)]
*  And so I think that now the Iranians have to sit back and consider what they considered [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=103.06s)]
*  their most important capability. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=108.18s)]
*  Their ballistic missiles, their drones, and their cruise missiles have now been employed [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=110.34s)]
*  in a major combat test, and frankly, that test has failed. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=115.4s)]
*  So I think Israel this morning is now much stronger than they were yesterday, and Iran [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=119.9s)]
*  is relatively weaker than it was yesterday. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=124.9s)]
*  But now it comes down to political decisions that Israel's leadership will be making, and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=128.44s)]
*  Kirby say those decisions haven't been made yet on what a reprisal will look like by Israel. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=134.62s)]
*  Would you advise, if you were in your former role, Israeli leaders to pull back here? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=142.38s)]
*  How concerned are you about a regional escalation? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=149.12s)]
*  So I think one of the opportunities for the victor in a major battle that was just fought, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=155.1s)]
*  Israel won, is the opportunity to use restraint. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=160.78s)]
*  And I would counsel restraint. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=163.82s)]
*  There will be voices that will urge the Israelis to take out the Iranian nuclear program, which [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=165.38s)]
*  I think is a false chimera anyway. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=170.86s)]
*  But I would argue that if you're going to do something, and they may have to do something, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=173.82s)]
*  I would be precise. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=176.7s)]
*  I would be short. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=177.9s)]
*  The fact of the matter is Israel can name the price they want to exact. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=179.04s)]
*  The wide gap between Iranian zealotry and enthusiasm and Israeli competence has now [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=183.22s)]
*  been laid bare for all to see. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=188.34s)]
*  So the Israelis will be able to do what they want. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=190.28s)]
*  But sometimes when you're in that position, showing some restraint is the best strategic [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=191.88s)]
*  option that you can take. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=195.56s)]
*  Chairman McCaul was here and he said, we see now Iran is not 10 feet tall. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=197.72s)]
*  It sounds like you're saying Israel can shrug this off. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=201.84s)]
*  I don't think Israel can shrug it off because I think Israel still needs to be concerned [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=208.0s)]
*  about Lebanese Hezbollah up north in Lebanon. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=211.7s)]
*  They do have the ability to hurt Israel if they come into the fight. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=214.54s)]
*  Interesting last night, there were some tactical back and forth in the northern border, but [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=218.24s)]
*  nothing like the volume of fires that LH, Lebanese Hezbollah, could have generated had [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=222.3s)]
*  they wanted to come into the fight. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=226.96s)]
*  The fact that they did not choose to do so is, I think, very, very important. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  It's a very important thing to note because they know and understand what Israel can do [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  to them. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=236.36s)]
*  I've never viewed the Iranians as being 10 foot tall. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=237.36s)]
*  I don't think the Israelis have either. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=239.64000000000001s)]
*  I have a healthy respect for at least their enthusiasm and their willingness to undertake [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=241.28s)]
*  things that we saw last night. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=247.32s)]
*  But now the Iranians have got to sit back and, although they'll never say it publicly, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=249.0s)]
*  they're going to have to examine, re-examine some of the very basic concepts of the way [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=253.16s)]
*  they've constructed their military. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=257.96s)]
*  Lebanese Hezbollah has not entered this conflict to date in a substantial way. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=261.08s)]
*  I know you've been warning for a while that that's the player to watch. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=266.24s)]
*  You were directly involved in the taking out of IRGC Commander Qassem Soleimani during [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=271.42s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=278.18s)]
*  And then Iran's retaliation at that time was also viewed as fairly restrained. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=280.44s)]
*  How concerned should the United States be though now in this moment about U.S. personnel [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=286.18s)]
*  and U.S. troop presence in places like Iraq and Syria? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=291.54s)]
*  As you know, this is a live issue at the White House this week as the Iraqi prime minister [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=295.98s)]
*  visits. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=300.66s)]
*  Our forces distributed across Iraq and Syria, supporting the armed forces of Iraq in anti-ISIS [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=303.24s)]
*  operations and supporting our SDF partners in eastern Syria, those forces are vulnerable [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=309.94s)]
*  to an Iranian or an Iranian proxy attack. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=315.66s)]
*  We recognize that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=318.18s)]
*  I think that's why the president's been very forceful in warning them. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=319.38s)]
*  Now it's also very instructive that the Iranians did not choose to attack us as they conducted [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=322.36s)]
*  a major strategic attack on Israel. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=327.94000000000005s)]
*  So they've listened to that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=330.3s)]
*  The Iranians know that we have the capability, if they choose to fight us, to hurt them very [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=331.78000000000003s)]
*  badly. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=336.06s)]
*  And I think that the Iranians will think long and hard before undertaking attacks against [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=337.06s)]
*  us in the future. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=340.7s)]
*  If Israel were to respond, would you have suggested targets? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=343.5s)]
*  What would you expect? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=347.22s)]
*  Well the Israelis have a lot to choose from, both inside Iran and outside Iran. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=350.22s)]
*  My only strategic advice would be you want to be narrow, you want to make sure that it [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=355.42s)]
*  has a definable beginning and a definable end and the Iranians know when it's over. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=361.90000000000003s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is Israel can name its price right now. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=367.06s)]
*  And that's a very heady position to be in. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=371.24s)]
*  But it's also a position that calls for exercise of strategic restraint in a view to the long [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=373.5s)]
*  term. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=379.42s)]
*  And I think that's an opportunity here, I think, to demonstrate that and to seize the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=380.42s)]
*  diplomatic initiative really in an arena where they've struggled to do it over the past few [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=385.1s)]
*  months. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=389.14000000000004s)]
*  We will see if they make that political decision. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=390.14000000000004s)]
*  General, thank you very much for your analysis. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMG60w2F4w&t=393.14000000000004s)]
