# What would an Iranian attack on Israel mean for the war on Hamas?
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4)
*  A White House official says that the U.S. is adjusting its posture in the Middle East [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=0.0s)]
*  as it monitors tensions between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=4.0200000000000005s)]
*  For analysis, we are joined now by CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=7.2s)]
*  for our weekly national security recap. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=11.36s)]
*  So, Sam, let's just start off. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=13.8s)]
*  What are Iran's capabilities? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=15.66s)]
*  Well, the U.S. intelligence community estimates that Iran has access to the largest ballistic [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=17.16s)]
*  missile stockpile in the region. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  At the same time, Iran and its proxies have a large stockpile of cruise missiles, rockets, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=24.84s)]
*  and other forms of aerial projectiles like drones. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  Now, if we look at Israel, Israel has a sophisticated and multilayered air defense system that is [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=33.36s)]
*  designed to mitigate those aerial projectiles at various altitudes and at various speeds. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=39.6s)]
*  Israel has a large arsenal of weapons that it can use to inflict damage in the region [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=46.16s)]
*  as well. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=51.04s)]
*  That's exactly why there's such intense diplomacy to try to de-escalate the situation. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=52.04s)]
*  Now, we know that there are a series of risks to Americans in the region, namely at military [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=56.44s)]
*  facilities and at embassies and consulates. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=61.2s)]
*  And the U.S. government right now is regularly assessing what additional assets may be needed [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=63.68s)]
*  to protect those Americans overseas and whether to draw down, for example, diplomatic personnel [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=69.08s)]
*  at our embassy and consulate in Israel, our embassy in Lebanon, our embassy in Iraq, and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=75.06s)]
*  That's an ongoing discussion within the U.S. government right now. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=81.44s)]
*  And what's the threat of a larger escalation? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=84.72s)]
*  Well, from a global counterterrorism perspective, there are really two buckets of international [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=87.2s)]
*  terrorism threats overseas. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=92.88s)]
*  First, Iran trains, equips, and funds a vast web of proxies in the region that have a history [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=94.56s)]
*  of attacking the U.S. military and others in places like Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=102.08s)]
*  in the region. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=107.38s)]
*  We also know in the aftermath of the ISIS-Khorasan attack in Russia just shortly ago that ISIS [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=108.52s)]
*  is capitalizing on that attack to try to inspire more similar kinds of attacks against the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=115.58s)]
*  United States and others in Europe and around the world. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  When we come back and look at the homeland, Lana, it is possible but not that likely that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=125.8s)]
*  an international terrorist, a foreign terrorist organization would try to send operatives [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=131.32s)]
*  here to conduct an attack. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=135.6s)]
*  What FBI Director Wray said earlier this week is, in fact, that the biggest threat from [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=138.24s)]
*  a foreign terrorist organization to the homeland right now is individuals here in the United [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=142.44s)]
*  States being inspired by what they're seeing overseas, whether it's ISIS or Iranian-backed [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=147.34s)]
*  proxies, and taking action. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=152.28s)]
*  We had an individual arrested in Idaho earlier this month for pledging allegiance to ISIS, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=154.24s)]
*  so that's a real focus. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=159.48s)]
*  And then, finally, FBI Director Wray in testimony this week said that the number of investigations [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=160.48s)]
*  into domestic terrorism has more than doubled since 2020, and that's primarily individuals [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=166.4s)]
*  with anti-government motivations and racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=171.8s)]
*  Well, also in Washington this week, several meetings between the U.S. and Japanese leaders [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=177.12s)]
*  took place. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  How does this partnership impact national security? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  The Japan state visit was a major advance when it comes to the security and safety of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=185.96s)]
*  the Asia Pacific region. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=191.8s)]
*  President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida were focused on showing a united front in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=193.4s)]
*  the face of an increasingly aggressive China, and they succeeded. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=197.36s)]
*  The two leaders announced a series of new initiatives in the military, economic space, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=200.96s)]
*  and climate domain, and they also welcomed the president of Philippines to Washington [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=206.4s)]
*  for a trilateral summit where they discussed, for example, efforts to bolster security in [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=211.4s)]
*  the contested waters of the South China Sea. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=216.24s)]
*  So overall, it was a big step forward for security in the Asia Pacific between these [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=218.48s)]
*  three countries. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  All right, Sam, thank you. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCkDl_a7u4&t=225.95999999999998s)]
