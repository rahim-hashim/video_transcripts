# Breaking down the threat of U.S. "bunker-buster" bombs to Iran
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c)
*  The International Atomic Energy Agency, or the IAEA, reported today that Friday's air [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=0.0s)]
*  strikes launched by Israel at different Iranian nuclear energy sites appeared to have damaged [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=6.28s)]
*  the underground enrichment tunnels at the largest facility. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=12.16s)]
*  One of Israel's stated goals for the current missile wave is to destroy Iran's nuclear [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  capacity to prevent it from creating a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Currently in Iran, there are seven sites engaged in nuclear research, enrichment, or providing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=24.6s)]
*  power. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=29.98s)]
*  Of those, Fordow has attracted the most attention because it is estimated to be between 260 [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=31.14s)]
*  and 300 feet underground. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=38.54s)]
*  According to the Council on Foreign Relations, which protects it from most air attacks, Fordow [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=40.7s)]
*  is the smaller of the two nuclear enrichment facilities in Iran. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=45.94s)]
*  IAEA inspectors noted, though, in 2023 that it found uranium particles at the facility [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=50.66s)]
*  Iran claimed at the time this level of enrichment was accidental, but it has been reportedly [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=57.06s)]
*  enriching uranium at 60 percent capacity for at least two years at this facility, in violation [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=69.02000000000001s)]
*  of the nuclear agreement it signed in 2015. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=76.30000000000001s)]
*  Now, while the facility is protected from most weapon attacks, there is one tool that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=79.30000000000001s)]
*  has a chance of penetrating it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=85.3s)]
*  It's known as the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, also known as a Bunker Buster. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=87.7s)]
*  The weapon is 20 feet long, 30,000 pounds, and specifically designed to breach buried [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=93.06s)]
*  facilities like Fordow. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=99.34s)]
*  The Bunker Buster has a heavy steel case with a smaller amount of explosives inside. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=101.42s)]
*  It's designed to have a detonator which waits to ignite until the weapon penetrates the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=107.25999999999999s)]
*  So the ammunition doesn't go off too early. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=112.66s)]
*  These weapons can only be deployed by the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber, which is exclusively [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=115.82s)]
*  the property of the U.S. government. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  The B-2s can carry two Bunker Busters at a time, and the U.S. deployed several of them [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=123.42s)]
*  to the Indian Ocean south of the Middle East. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=129.26s)]
*  For more on all of this, and it is a lot, let's bring in Tom Karakow. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=132.9s)]
*  He is the Director of the Missile Defense Project and a Senior Fellow at the Center [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=136.5s)]
*  for Strategic and International Studies. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=140.66s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=143.66s)]
*  Thank you for breaking this down for us. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=144.9s)]
*  Tom, since the U.S. is the only country capable of deploying a so-called Bunker Buster, is [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=146.9s)]
*  it fair to say Israel needs the United States to completely destroy Iran's nuclear program? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=152.82s)]
*  Israel has already kind of committed to going this with or without the United States, but [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=160.66s)]
*  yes, you're right. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=164.78s)]
*  There is a qualitative difference. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=166.54s)]
*  There's a capability difference that the United States can bring to bear to be able to crack [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=167.82s)]
*  the mountain and to drive a wedge with one or more of these Bunker Busters to essentially [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=172.1s)]
*  create a small earthquake and hopefully put this facility to end. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=178.62s)]
*  I got to tell you, I heard you say just a second ago that the Iranians claim to have [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=185.85999999999999s)]
*  done this by mistake. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=189.74s)]
*  Look, I think Britney Spears can say, oops, I did it again, but you don't accidentally [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=191.22s)]
*  enrich uranium to this level by accident. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=194.82s)]
*  And Tom, if Ferdows were severely damaged or destroyed, how much would that set back [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=198.06s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=203.38s)]
*  It's certainly one of the very key facilities where they do a whole lot of the enrichment, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=206.26s)]
*  and so it is very rightly prioritized on the target list. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=210.78s)]
*  It's also the reason why Iran has hidden it under a mountain to protect it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=214.1s)]
*  I think a lot of people want to know, is there a risk of radiation spreading to civilian [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=219.38s)]
*  areas if this facility were hit? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=224.26s)]
*  Well, it is after all under a mountain, so I think that's probably minimal. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=227.61999999999998s)]
*  And if they do their job correctly, it would presumably contain the material. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=231.42s)]
*  All right, Tom Karakou, thank you so much. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uuTROld7c&t=237.22s)]
