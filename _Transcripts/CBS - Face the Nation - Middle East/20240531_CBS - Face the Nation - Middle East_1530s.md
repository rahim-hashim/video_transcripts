# Biden announces proposal to end Israel-Hamas war, reacts to Trump conviction | Special Report
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ)
*  This is a CBS News special report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Nora O'Donnell in Washington, and we are coming on the air because President Biden [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=9.1s)]
*  is about to deliver remarks from the White House. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=13.68s)]
*  We are told by officials there that the content of those remarks will deal with the Middle [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=17.06s)]
*  East. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=21.96s)]
*  This comes just days after munitions experts tell CBS News that Israel used a U.S.-made [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=22.96s)]
*  bomb in a strike on Rafa that killed dozens while targeting Hamas leaders. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=28.46s)]
*  Now, Israel and Hamas have been at war for 238 days since Hamas-led militants killed [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=33.54s)]
*  around 1,200 people and abducted hundreds of others in the October 7th attack last year. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=40.58s)]
*  Since then, the Gaza Health Ministry says more than 36,000 people have been killed as [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=46.5s)]
*  a result of Israel's invasion into Gaza. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=51.18s)]
*  This is the first opportunity also for President Biden to publicly address former President [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=55.1s)]
*  Trump's historic New York criminal conviction. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  We already heard from former President Trump earlier today in a rambling speech that was [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=64.6s)]
*  full of grievance and full of untruths, in which he said alarmingly, quote, we're living [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=69.36s)]
*  in a fascist state. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=75.08s)]
*  So while there appears to have been some developments in the Middle East that the president may [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=77.42s)]
*  comment on today, we do expect, too, that he will likely comment on his expected opponent [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=81.94s)]
*  in this race, and that is Donald Trump, who is the presumptive Republican nominee. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=87.74000000000001s)]
*  I am joined by our Chief Washington correspondent, Major Garrett, as well as our Chief Foreign [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=93.98s)]
*  correspondent, Margaret Brennan. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=98.66s)]
*  And, Margaret, you follow so closely what's happening in the world. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=101.14s)]
*  Israel did admit that it has a ground operation underway in Rafa. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=105.66s)]
*  Does that violate a red line for President Biden? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=108.64s)]
*  That's the key question. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=111.7s)]
*  The president has been completely unclear as to what a full-scale ground invasion would [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=112.82s)]
*  look like for him. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=117.22s)]
*  Eyewitnesses have told CBS that there are tanks on the ground. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=118.22s)]
*  What we also know is we're eight months into a conflict that has killed more civilians [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=123.46s)]
*  than terrorists, according to the Israeli prime minister. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=127.6s)]
*  Hamas is coming back in areas the Israeli military claims to have cleared. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=130.34s)]
*  The secretary of state said just yesterday that the Israeli government needs to be warned [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  that they may soon face a fate worse than Hamas's, quote-unquote, jihadis. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=139.62s)]
*  All this while at least 120 hostages remain held by Hamas or affiliated groups, five of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  them U.S. citizens. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=149.86s)]
*  The president has had his CIA director, his national security adviser, working to try [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=151.22s)]
*  to secure their release alongside a ceasefire of conflict, as you know, Nora, that has [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=155.62s)]
*  had domestic implications here with protests across college campuses. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=161.06s)]
*  As we see in our CBS polling, upset in particular among key groups that historically have been [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=166.3s)]
*  supportive of the president. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=171.54s)]
*  And Major, also this is the first time that we may hear from President Biden on camera [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=173.3s)]
*  since this historic conviction in New York. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=178.78s)]
*  Symbolism and substance going on simultaneously, Nora. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=183.42000000000002s)]
*  The substance is the presidency goes on. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=186.7s)]
*  The president is governing and will make remarks on an ongoing international conflict of significant [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=189.42000000000002s)]
*  importance for the United States and all its regional allies, but also will wade into this [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=194.54s)]
*  controversy, which he has tried to stay away from as best as humanly possible. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=199.62s)]
*  Meaning Trump's legal problems. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=204.26s)]
*  Meaning Trump's legal problems. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=205.46s)]
*  Even though the former president argues with zero foundation that Biden is directing this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=206.86s)]
*  and he's responsible for it, he's not. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=211.62s)]
*  But the president has tried to stay away from it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=213.98s)]
*  Now he will have a chance to render some statement for the country about what it all might mean. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=217.26s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=223.14000000000001s)]
*  Before I begin my remarks, I just want to say a few words about what happened yesterday [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=228.46s)]
*  in New York City. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=233.1s)]
*  The American principle that no one is above the law was reaffirmed. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=235.82s)]
*  Donald Trump was given every opportunity to defend himself. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=241.74s)]
*  It was a state case, not a federal case. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=244.74s)]
*  It was heard by a jury of 12 citizens, 12 Americans, 12 people like you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=249.18s)]
*  Like millions of Americans who served on juries, this jury is chosen the same way every jury [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=256.46s)]
*  in America is chosen. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=262.38s)]
*  It was a process that Donald Trump's attorney was part of. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=263.94s)]
*  The jury heard five weeks of evidence. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=268.58s)]
*  Five weeks. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=271.18s)]
*  And after careful deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous verdict. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=272.18s)]
*  They found Donald Trump guilty on all 34 felony counts. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=278.06s)]
*  Now he'll be given the opportunity, as he should, to appeal that decision just like [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=284.46s)]
*  everyone else has that opportunity. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=288.7s)]
*  That's how the American system of justice works. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=291.54s)]
*  And it's reckless. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=295.14s)]
*  It's dangerous. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=296.14s)]
*  It's irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don't like the verdict. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=297.14s)]
*  Our justice system has endured for nearly 250 years. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=305.54s)]
*  And it literally is the cornerstone of America, our justice system. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=310.34000000000003s)]
*  The justice system should be respected. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=314.38s)]
*  And we should never allow anyone to tear it down. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=316.94s)]
*  It's as simple as that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=319.90000000000003s)]
*  That's America. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=322.38s)]
*  That's who we are. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=324.06s)]
*  That's who we'll always be, God willing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=326.38s)]
*  Now to another issue. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=329.42s)]
*  I want to give an update on my efforts to end the crisis in Gaza. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=333.58000000000004s)]
*  For the past several months, my negotiators, the foreign policy, intelligence community, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=337.38s)]
*  and like have been relentlessly focused not just on a ceasefire that would inevitably [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=343.34000000000003s)]
*  be fragile and temporary, but on a durable end to the war. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=351.1s)]
*  That's been the focus, a durable end to this war. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=355.14000000000004s)]
*  One that brings all the hostages home, ensures Israel's security, creates a better day [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=358.42s)]
*  after in Gaza without Hamas in power, and sets the stage for a political settlement [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=365.46s)]
*  that provides a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=372.65999999999997s)]
*  Now after intensive diplomacy carried out by my team, my many conversations with leaders [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=378.34s)]
*  of Israel, Qatar, and Egypt, and other Middle Eastern countries, Israel has now offered [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=385.06s)]
*  Israel has offered a comprehensive new proposal. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=390.9s)]
*  It's a roadmap to an enduring ceasefire and the release of all hostages. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=394.9s)]
*  This proposal has been transmitted by Qatar to Hamas. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=401.62s)]
*  Today, I want to lay out its terms for the American citizens and for the world. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=406.18s)]
*  This new proposal has three phases, three. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=412.97999999999996s)]
*  The first phase would last for six weeks. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=416.46s)]
*  Here's what it would include, a full and complete ceasefire, a withdrawal of Israeli [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=420.26s)]
*  forces from all populated areas of Gaza, release of a number of hostages, including women, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=426.29999999999995s)]
*  the elderly, the wounded, and the exchange release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=433.97999999999996s)]
*  There are American hostages who would be released at this stage, and we want them home. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=439.7s)]
*  Additional some remains of hostages who have been killed would be returned to their families, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=445.06s)]
*  bringing some degree closer to that terrible grief. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=450.46s)]
*  Palestinians, civilians would be returned to their homes and neighborhoods in all areas [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=454.86s)]
*  of Gaza, including in the north. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=460.41999999999996s)]
*  Humanitarian assistance would surge with 600 trucks carrying aid into Gaza every single day. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=463.94s)]
*  With a ceasefire, that aid could be safely and effectively distributed to all who needed. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=472.58s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of temporary shelters, including housing units, would be delivered [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=480.34s)]
*  by the international community. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=484.85999999999996s)]
*  All that and more would begin immediately. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=487.34s)]
*  Immediately. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=491.9s)]
*  During the six weeks of phase one, Israel and Hamas would negotiate the necessary arrangements [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=493.74s)]
*  to get to phase two, which is a permanent end to hostilities. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=499.82s)]
*  Now I'll be straight with you. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=506.42s)]
*  There are a number of details to negotiate to move from phase one to phase two. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=508.38s)]
*  Israel will want to make sure its interests are protected. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=513.74s)]
*  But the proposal says if the negotiations take longer than six weeks from phase one, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=518.0200000000001s)]
*  the ceasefire will still continue as long as negotiations continue. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=524.38s)]
*  In the United States, Egypt and Qatar would work to ensure negotiations keep going. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=527.98s)]
*  All agreements, all agreements, until all the agreements are reached and phase two is [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=534.5s)]
*  able to begin. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=539.46s)]
*  Then phase two, there would be an exchange for the release of all remaining living hostages, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=541.66s)]
*  including male soldiers, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza, and as long as Hamas lives [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=549.14s)]
*  up to its commitments, a temporary ceasefire would become, in the words of the Israeli [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=555.18s)]
*  proposal, the cessation of hostilities permanently. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=560.02s)]
*  End of quote. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=564.2199999999999s)]
*  Cessation of hostilities permanently. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=565.86s)]
*  Finally, in phase three, a major reconstruction plan for Gaza would commence, and any final [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=568.42s)]
*  remains of hostages who have been killed would be returned to their families. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=576.4599999999999s)]
*  That's the offer that's now on the table. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=582.54s)]
*  And what we've been asking for is what we need. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=585.62s)]
*  The people of Israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=589.78s)]
*  their own security because they've devastated Hamas forces over the past eight months. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=594.74s)]
*  At this point, Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another October 7th, which [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=602.5s)]
*  is one of Israel's main objectives in this war, and quite frankly, a righteous one. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=608.7s)]
*  I know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=615.0600000000001s)]
*  the war to continue indefinitely. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=619.34s)]
*  Some. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=621.74s)]
*  Some are even in the government coalition. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=622.74s)]
*  And they've made it clear they want to occupy Gaza, they want to keep fighting for years, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=625.0600000000001s)]
*  and the hostages are not a priority to them. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=632.54s)]
*  Well, I've urged the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal, despite whatever [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=635.26s)]
*  pressure comes. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=641.1800000000001s)]
*  And to the people of Israel, let me say this. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=642.1800000000001s)]
*  As someone who's had a lifelong commitment to Israel, as the only American president [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=646.5s)]
*  who's ever gone to Israel in a time of war, as someone who just sent the U.S. forces to [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=651.54s)]
*  directly defend Israel when it was attacked by Iran, I ask you to take a step back and [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=657.6999999999999s)]
*  think what will happen if this moment is lost. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=665.06s)]
*  We can't lose this moment. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=668.62s)]
*  Indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory will not bring Israel [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=672.54s)]
*  will not bring down, bogged out, will only bog down Israel and Gaza, draining the economic, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=678.98s)]
*  military and human resources and furthering Israel's isolation in the world. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=685.06s)]
*  That will not bring hostages home. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=691.54s)]
*  That will not not bring an enduring defeat of Hamas. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=694.42s)]
*  That will not bring Israel lasting security. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=698.64s)]
*  But a comprehensive approach that starts with this deal will bring hostages home and will [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=702.7s)]
*  lead to more secure Israel. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=709.74s)]
*  And once the ceasefire and hostage deal is concluded, it unlocks the possibility of a [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=712.46s)]
*  great deal more progress, including, including, come along Israel's northern border with [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=716.98s)]
*  Lebanon. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=723.22s)]
*  The United States will help forge a diplomatic resolution, one that ensures Israel's security [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=724.22s)]
*  and allows people to safely return to their homes without fear of being attacked. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=731.02s)]
*  With the deal, rebuilding of Gaza will begin. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=736.74s)]
*  Arab nations and the international community, along with Palestinian and Israeli leaders, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=741.42s)]
*  to get it done in a manner that does not allow Hamas to rearm. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=747.22s)]
*  And the United States will work with our partners to rebuild homes, schools and hospitals in [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=751.38s)]
*  Gaza to help repair communities that were destroyed in the chaos of war. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=757.6999999999999s)]
*  And with this deal, Israel could become more deeply integrated in the region, including [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=764.18s)]
*  it's no surprise to you all, including no potential historic normalization agreement [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=770.4599999999999s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=776.86s)]
*  Israel could be part of a regional security network to counter the threat posed by Iran. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=779.06s)]
*  All this progress would make Israel more secure, with Israeli families no longer living in [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=785.18s)]
*  the shadow of a terrorist attack. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=791.46s)]
*  And all this would create the conditions for a different future, a better future for the [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=793.6999999999999s)]
*  Palestinian people, one of self-determination, dignity, security and freedom. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=799.98s)]
*  This path is available once the deal is struck. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=808.86s)]
*  Israel will always have the right to defend itself against the threats to its security [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=813.5400000000001s)]
*  and to bring those responsible October 7th to justice. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=817.1800000000001s)]
*  And the United States will always ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=820.98s)]
*  If Hamas fails to fulfill its commitments under the deal, Israel can resume military [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=825.5s)]
*  operations. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=831.26s)]
*  But Benjamin Cutter have assured me and they are continuing to work to ensure that Hamas [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=832.26s)]
*  doesn't do that. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=838.38s)]
*  The United States will help ensure that Israel lives up to their obligations as well. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=840.14s)]
*  That's what this deal says. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=846.1s)]
*  That's what it says. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=847.42s)]
*  And we'll do our part. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=849.9s)]
*  This is truly a decisive moment. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=852.74s)]
*  Israel has made their proposal. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=856.2199999999999s)]
*  Hamas says it wants to cease fire. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=858.9s)]
*  This deal is an opportunity to prove whether they really mean it. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=862.38s)]
*  Hamas needs to take the deal. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=867.1800000000001s)]
*  For months, people all over the world have called for ceasefire. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=869.86s)]
*  Now it's time to raise your voices in demand that Hamas come to the table, agrees to this [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=874.1800000000001s)]
*  deal and end this war that they began. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=880.98s)]
*  Of course, there'll be differences on the specific details that need to be worked out. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=884.58s)]
*  That's natural. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=890.9s)]
*  If Hamas comes to negotiate ready to deal, then Israel negotiations must be given a mandate, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=892.54s)]
*  the necessary flexibility to close that deal. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=900.42s)]
*  The past eight months have marked heartbreaking pain. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=903.5s)]
*  Pain of those whose loved ones are slaughtered by Hamas terrorists on October 7th. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=910.66s)]
*  Hostages of their families waiting in anguish. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=915.22s)]
*  Ordinary Israelis whose lives were forever marked by the shattering event of Hamas' [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=918.9s)]
*  sexual violence and ruthless brutality. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=924.5799999999999s)]
*  And the Palestinian people have endured sheer hell in this war. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=927.38s)]
*  Too many innocent people have been killed, including thousands of children. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=932.78s)]
*  Far too many have been badly wounded. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=937.42s)]
*  We all saw the terrible images from the deadly fire in Ra'afeh earlier this week following [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=940.54s)]
*  an Israeli strike against targeting Hamas. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=946.86s)]
*  And even as we work to surge assistance to Gaza with 1,800 trucks delivering supplies [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=950.58s)]
*  these last five days, 1,800, the humanitarian crisis still remains. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=956.22s)]
*  I know this is a subject on which people in this country feel deep, passionate convictions. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=962.98s)]
*  So do I. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=968.5s)]
*  This has been one of the hardest, most complicated problems in the world. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=969.5s)]
*  There's nothing easy about this. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=974.3s)]
*  Nothing easy about it. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=976.5799999999999s)]
*  Through it all, though, the United States has worked relentlessly to support Israeli [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=979.2199999999999s)]
*  security, to get humanitarian supplies into Gaza, to get a ceasefire and a hostage deal [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=983.3s)]
*  to bring this war to an end. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=989.2199999999999s)]
*  Yesterday, with this new initiative, we've taken an important step in that direction. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=993.0999999999999s)]
*  I want to love with you today as to where we are and what might be possible. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1000.58s)]
*  But I need your help. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1007.5s)]
*  Everyone who wants peace now must raise their voices and let the leaders know they should [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1010.1s)]
*  take this deal, work to make it real, make it lasting, and forge a better future out [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1017.0600000000001s)]
*  of the tragic terror attack and war. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1024.38s)]
*  It's time to begin this new stage. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1027.98s)]
*  For the hostages to come home, for Israel to be secure, for the suffering to stop, it's [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1030.8600000000001s)]
*  time for this war to end. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1038.22s)]
*  For the day after to begin. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1042.74s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1046.46s)]
*  Mr. President, can you tell us your — Donald Trump refers to himself as a political prisoner [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1047.46s)]
*  and blames you directly. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1053.5s)]
*  What's your response to that, sir? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1054.5800000000002s)]
*  Do you think the conviction will have an impact on the campaign? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1057.98s)]
*  We'd love to hear your thoughts, sir. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1064.1000000000001s)]
*  Should we be on the back, sir? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1065.6200000000001s)]
*  Well done. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1070.3000000000002s)]
*  Well, there you have it, a significant set of remarks from the President of the United [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1072.3000000000002s)]
*  States and the Commander-in-Chief. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1078.26s)]
*  I say that there are two different things. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1080.3400000000001s)]
*  One, of course, he talked and responded to what has happened in New York City and the [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1082.18s)]
*  historic conviction of former President Donald Trump and his likely opponent in this upcoming [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1086.86s)]
*  election where he talked about the American principle that no one is above the law and [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1092.78s)]
*  then said clearly, it's reckless, dangerous, irresponsible to say that this was rigged [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1098.62s)]
*  just because someone doesn't like the outcome. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1104.78s)]
*  Also, there is big news on a new initiative, what he calls, in the Middle East to try and [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1107.58s)]
*  end this war. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1112.4199999999998s)]
*  We're going to break it all down. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1113.4199999999998s)]
*  We're going to go first to our senior White House and political correspondent, Ed O'Keefe, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1115.02s)]
*  who is at the White House and Ed, a significant set of remarks, as I said, from the President [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1118.46s)]
*  today. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1123.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, one of the newsiest ones he's had in a while because it allowed him to respond [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1124.8600000000001s)]
*  to what happened yesterday but then use the trappings of his office to convey to the world [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1128.98s)]
*  that he's doing the day job. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1133.7s)]
*  And that's exactly how his campaign wants it, that here he is dealing with something [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1135.02s)]
*  of grave global importance while his opponent said what he said this morning, accusing the [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1139.06s)]
*  sitting president once again of being responsible for the prosecution he faced in New York and [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1145.62s)]
*  is guilty. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1152.46s)]
*  And that idea that the American principle that no one is above the law is reaffirmed [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1153.46s)]
*  is the sort of institutional message that the president wants to send and by speaking [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1157.58s)]
*  out today, in essence, is trying to hold firm to. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1163.34s)]
*  But it is notable, it is to those of us who cover him, frustrating that he, as you saw [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1167.42s)]
*  there, declined to engage a little more and address the accusations made by his anticipated [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1173.38s)]
*  opponent that he was personally responsible for this prosecution, which there is no evidence [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1178.94s)]
*  that he was. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1183.1s)]
*  The other notable thing from those remarks regarding the Middle East, at least to this [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1184.1s)]
*  year, was the fact that he called on protesters who've been in the streets for months criticizing [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1188.42s)]
*  the president's support for Israel to say if you really for a ceasefire, now turn your [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1193.34s)]
*  attention to the leaders of Hamas and urge them to take this deal. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1198.1s)]
*  In essence, trying to take the public anger, not only in this country but around the world, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1201.74s)]
*  and have it redirected toward leadership of Hamas. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1206.26s)]
*  And he says that just days before he's headed to Europe, where he's likely to be confronted [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1208.3999999999999s)]
*  by leaders, but also potentially in the streets of France, where he'll go first and then [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1212.98s)]
*  Italy over American support for the conflict. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1217.4599999999998s)]
*  But again, an opportunity today for a president who is running even or slightly behind his [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1221.34s)]
*  opponent, Donald Trump, to respond to that and to then deal with a matter of foreign [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1227.06s)]
*  policy importance, Nora. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1233.78s)]
*  Ed O'Keefe, thank you. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1235.34s)]
*  I want to turn to our chief foreign correspondent, foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1237.02s)]
*  And Margaret, you follow this so closely. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1242.52s)]
*  How much of a new development is this in terms of this new Israeli proposal? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1246.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's the very first time I've heard the president of the United States say it [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1250.98s)]
*  is time for this war to end some eight months into this extremely bloody conflict. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1254.18s)]
*  It's also key the time of day, 1.45 here on the East Coast. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1259.42s)]
*  It is well into the evening on a Friday night in Israel. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1263.8600000000001s)]
*  For those observing, there will be restrictions on their ability to come out publicly and [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1267.74s)]
*  comment on this. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1271.42s)]
*  There will also be, as we have seen in Israel nearly every weekend of this conflict, protests [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1273.18s)]
*  against the Netanyahu government urging them to bring home the hostages through diplomacy [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1279.1399999999999s)]
*  versus through war. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1284.1799999999998s)]
*  But in terms of what the president laid out here today, he laid out this chessboard of [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1286.26s)]
*  here's the three phases to bring the hostages home. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1290.8999999999999s)]
*  For the first time, he was linking a short-term pause of six weeks, cessation and violence [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1294.4199999999998s)]
*  to a broader end to the conflict that he says the Israelis are open to at this point. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1299.9399999999998s)]
*  The CIA director met with the head of Mossad just last Friday in Paris, then also said [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1305.46s)]
*  once we get to the end of this, we can talk about Israelis returning to their homes in [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1311.3400000000001s)]
*  the north of the country. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1316.22s)]
*  This is a huge political issue back in Israel right now because in that conflict with Hezbollah [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1317.22s)]
*  in north Lebanon, people have had to flee their homes and haven't been able to go back. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1323.0600000000002s)]
*  And he also spoke to that broader promise to Benjamin Netanyahu, the embattled prime [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1327.14s)]
*  minister, and we might be able to get you a peace deal with Saudi Arabia. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1332.1399999999999s)]
*  He is dangling a lot of carrots out there to a politically embattled leader and really [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1336.26s)]
*  gestured to the pressure that's on the Israeli prime minister from the far right of his party, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1341.98s)]
*  saying there's some we know in your government who don't want this war to end. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1346.54s)]
*  But it also seemed very clear, too, that the president was laying out that Israel has come [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1350.8999999999999s)]
*  to a deal that was transmitted by the Qataris to Hamas, that this ball is now in Hamas' [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1356.46s)]
*  court, and that that's where not only he wants the solution to be found or perhaps [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1361.66s)]
*  negotiated, but also, I think, to put the pressure back on Hamas in the eyes of the [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1366.94s)]
*  world. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1372.74s)]
*  Yes, he was doing that as laid out there. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1373.74s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1376.98s)]
*  I'm drawing the distinction between what the Israeli intelligence apparatus has been [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1377.98s)]
*  able to agree to with the United States versus the political decisions made by the prime [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1383.0600000000002s)]
*  minister. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1387.74s)]
*  And sometimes those things have been in conflict and Biden officials have been very frustrated with this. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1389.74s)]
*  And absent from the president's formal remarks was a direct reference to Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1392.74s)]
*  the Israeli prime minister, supporting this and carrying this forward under his auspices, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1397.82s)]
*  even with a divided cabinet. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1403.22s)]
*  This is a proposal. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1405.58s)]
*  It is not a deal. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1406.58s)]
*  And proposals as, Margaret, and you and I know in the Middle East, live forever, but [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1408.66s)]
*  they are hard to achieve. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1414.34s)]
*  And lots of proposals come and go in the Middle East. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1416.86s)]
*  With the U.S. for decades leading the effort to bring peace to the world. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1418.9799999999998s)]
*  There are three phases to this, but there is only one practical phase. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1422.26s)]
*  If this isn't agreed to as far as a cessation of hostility, withdrawing of Israeli forces, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1425.6599999999999s)]
*  putting back of some of the hostages, there is no phase two and phase three. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1431.1s)]
*  And absent that declaration from the president that I've talked to Bibi Netanyahu, he supports [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1435.82s)]
*  together, there is some curiosity I have about how devoted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1441.18s)]
*  is to this particular proposal. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1449.1000000000001s)]
*  And if it is entirely in Hamas's hands to decide whether or not this becomes a deal [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1450.9s)]
*  which transforms it from a proposal to something that both sides can work on. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1455.38s)]
*  It's excellent analysis. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1459.26s)]
*  Can I also get your take, Major, on what the president said about Donald Trump and Donald [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1460.26s)]
*  Trump's comments that this whole conviction and trial was rigged and Donald Trump's efforts [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1466.02s)]
*  to undermine the American judicial system? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1472.8999999999999s)]
*  Yes, President Trump said that. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1475.3s)]
*  It doesn't make it true. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1477.02s)]
*  And as the president pointed out, every opportunity to, through due process, defend yourself, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1478.26s)]
*  question jurors, apply the evidence to scrutiny, was given to that defendant, the former president [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1483.42s)]
*  who is now a convicted felon. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1488.6599999999999s)]
*  Period. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1491.06s)]
*  And I thought it was interesting. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1492.06s)]
*  The former president also said he can appeal this. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1493.26s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1495.58s)]
*  Go back to the court. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1496.58s)]
*  You have every right, as every American does. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1497.58s)]
*  But it's dangerous to say this is rigged. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1498.58s)]
*  That is not just Donald Trump. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1500.58s)]
*  That is a number of elected Republican officials who have come out with statements questioning [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1502.1399999999999s)]
*  the judicial system in this country. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1505.6599999999999s)]
*  Because as President Biden said, our justice system is the cornerstone of America and we [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1507.5s)]
*  should never allow anyone to tear it down. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1511.82s)]
*  Our coverage will continue on CBS News 24-7, your local news. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1515.1s)]
*  And we're going to have a full wrap up and more analysis tonight on the CBS Evening News. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1519.1s)]
*  This has been a CBS News special report. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1523.7s)]
*  I'm Nora O'Donnell. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6FyRHnseQ&t=1525.62s)]
