# Netanyahu addresses Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's death as families push for hostages' release
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the nation internationally about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=0.0s)]
*  what had occurred and what this means as he was saying, this is a moment. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=5.48s)]
*  Now CBS News reporter Courtney Keighley joining me again live with more context, certainly [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=9.64s)]
*  a stern message and heartfelt obviously to the hostages and to the families. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  What more did you glean from this? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=19.34s)]
*  Well there's quite a lot to unpack here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=22.68s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu is an embattled prime minister. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=25.08s)]
*  The domestic approval ratings have been down. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  The hostages' families have been upset with him. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=31.64s)]
*  He spoke directly to anyone left in Hamas and Gaza saying, it is put down your weapons, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=33.7s)]
*  give us our loved ones back. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=39.8s)]
*  He assured that his top commitment is getting all the loved ones back from Gaza. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=41.459999999999994s)]
*  We also know that some of them have been deceased, but they want all bodies back. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=47.56s)]
*  They want all loved ones back who are alive. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=52.459999999999994s)]
*  He spoke to the Palestinian, Sinwar has ruined your life. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=54.44s)]
*  He spoke several times about darkness making light, turning into light. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=58.4s)]
*  He invoked God. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=63.64s)]
*  He talked about King David. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=64.88s)]
*  And he basically also said, which is really important, the task at hand has yet to be completed. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=66.68s)]
*  This is not over with Sinwar, which was my interpretation what he said. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=72.68s)]
*  Is the war over? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=76.44s)]
*  No. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=77.44s)]
*  He called for patience. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=78.44s)]
*  He called for courage. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=79.52s)]
*  He wants this chief terrorist who created the worst massacre since the Holocaust on [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=81.08s)]
*  Israeli soil. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=87.4s)]
*  He made sure that people knew, the Palestinians and people in the region knew, that he was [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  on the back foot running away in a dark tunnel when he was killed. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=92.84s)]
*  He spoke to the Palestinians and said, your leader was running away. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=97.72s)]
*  He spoke to Palestinians that did not adhere or, well, they were under the thumb of Hamas, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=101.96s)]
*  did not support Hamas. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=107.8s)]
*  They would have to do that quietly, though. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=108.84s)]
*  Many times I was in Gaza, you could not speak out against Hamas for fear of reprisal. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=110.84s)]
*  As a reporter, I had to take that into context. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=116.0s)]
*  So this is Netanyahu's moment. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=118.72s)]
*  This is one could say his Osama bin Laden moment. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=121.2s)]
*  But what's really what we're going to have to look at next is what he's going to do next [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=123.92s)]
*  in Gaza and does he continue to go to Iran? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=127.68s)]
*  Because he mentioned all the leaders that were killed of these terrorist organizations, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=130.68s)]
*  including Nasrallah, including Haniyeh and now Sinwar. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=134.84s)]
*  He did not say this is over. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=138.2s)]
*  He did not say game over. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=139.92s)]
*  He said, yeah, this is continuing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=141.24s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=143.48s)]
*  To your point, we were just quoting. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=144.48s)]
*  He said it has settled its account with Sinwar, but war is not yet ended in a context for [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  the hostages and for their families. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=152.56s)]
*  What is a timeline? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=155.16s)]
*  I guess we can't even guess what that means. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=156.16s)]
*  But how how fast do things move now? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=158.56s)]
*  Well, it really it really requires the IDF to continue to risk their lives on the ground. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=162.28s)]
*  It requires Palestinians to they're under an incredible humanitarian crisis, suffering [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=168.96s)]
*  every day. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=176.36s)]
*  Where are the hostages? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=177.84s)]
*  Do the IDF have eyes on them? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  Were they waiting to kill Sinwar so they could get to them? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=180.48s)]
*  This is going to have to unfold probably not in the day or days to come, but maybe weeks [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=183.36s)]
*  to come. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=187.68s)]
*  Watch and wait and see that's critical to get those hostages home. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=188.72s)]
*  Will Netanyahu actually be able to do that? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=192.16s)]
*  That's the big question mark. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  Will Israeli soldiers continue to risk their lives and be killed in in the north in the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  fight with Hezbollah? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=200.28s)]
*  Will airstrikes continue on Beirut? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=201.52s)]
*  Will they continue saying they're going after the remnants of Hezbollah and Hamas? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=203.28s)]
*  Will civilians in the region still being killed? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=207.68s)]
*  Women and children under these Israeli airstrikes? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=211.0s)]
*  What about the Iranian retribution for those Iranian ballistic missiles? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  So we're looking at a lot of things in play, but right now this was Prime Minister Netanyahu's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=219.12s)]
*  moment to say we got him. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=222.56s)]
*  We got this person who ruled with a messianic zeal, who believed that everything came with [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=225.56s)]
*  a cost. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  He didn't mind. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  He really spoke out about letting Palestinians risk their lives or be killed in the name [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  of killing Israelis. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=241.24s)]
*  Over 1200 were killed in the Hamas massacres. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=242.8s)]
*  We've seen tens of thousands being killed in Gaza. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  And now we've seen a million displaced in Beirut. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=249.32000000000002s)]
*  So this has caused a huge issue throughout the region. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=253.56s)]
*  And Netanyahu has always made clear his ultimate enemy, his ultimate foe, is the Islamic Republic [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=257.68s)]
*  of Iran. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=262.92s)]
*  And that's what I'm keeping my eye on. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=263.92s)]
*  So obviously Netanyahu declaring the moment for himself and for international movement. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=266.24s)]
*  But I am curious with Sinwar being the mastermind, as you were describing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=272.12s)]
*  Is there a hierarchy in sense? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=277.76s)]
*  Is there a second in command? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=279.36s)]
*  Or did he just rule and that's going to be a game changer for developments to come? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=281.5s)]
*  He was one of the forefathers. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=288.3s)]
*  He spent 22 years in Israeli jails learning Hebrew and studying, quote, his enemy when [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=289.6s)]
*  he was released in that prisoner swap in 2011 after the release of the Israeli soldier, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=295.06s)]
*  Gilad Shalit. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=300.06s)]
*  He came in, but he was not the leader. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=301.06s)]
*  You have people like Khalid Mashal who's still alive, more of a senior leader, more semi-retired, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=303.70000000000005s)]
*  but could be coming out at any time to speak about this. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=309.18s)]
*  We don't know really the state of play with Al Qasim Brigades or what Hamas leadership [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=312.5s)]
*  looks like in Gaza. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=317.22s)]
*  But they've always had a diaspora. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=318.86s)]
*  They have existed in Beirut. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=320.54s)]
*  They kept a satellite bureau there. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=322.1s)]
*  Some of them existed because they had been expelled from Gaza and never went back. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=324.18s)]
*  So is this just like Hezbollah we're looking, is the decimation of this whole leadership? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=328.14s)]
*  Will Fatah and other Palestinian groups be able to come in in the vacuum? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=334.65999999999997s)]
*  What will happen right now? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=339.18s)]
*  But what we're left with is a decimated Gaza with a humanitarian crisis, hostages still [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=340.34s)]
*  there and Sinwar who would not give up despite the Israeli airstrikes, despite the starvation [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=346.5s)]
*  and hunger, despite the killing of his own people. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=352.66s)]
*  He's gone. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=355.86s)]
*  And what does that mean for Palestinians? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=356.86s)]
*  What does it mean for the Lebanese? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=358.62s)]
*  What does it mean for Hamas in terms of how much of their leadership is left? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=360.18s)]
*  Like Hezbollah and Nasrallah, it's unclear. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=365.54s)]
*  But they got a long time devotee that brought Hamas into, like I said, a messianic zealotry [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=368.5s)]
*  of killing Israelis, only functioning to destroy the state of Israel, sacrificing their own [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=376.58s)]
*  people for the idea of killing Israelis and going after the Israeli state. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=383.06s)]
*  He is no longer there. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=389.82s)]
*  Will Hamas actually wave a red flag? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=391.46s)]
*  Who in Hamas still exists? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=394.29999999999995s)]
*  You have the social welfare group. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=396.09999999999997s)]
*  You've got people and civilians. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=397.5s)]
*  But will they, will people come out in Gaza and be happy to be happy to have Hamas gone? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=399.5s)]
*  No one is happy in Gaza. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=405.78s)]
*  It's decimated. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=408.06s)]
*  It's destroyed. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=409.06s)]
*  People are, people don't even have the basic health care needs, the basic sanitation. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=410.61999999999995s)]
*  Netanyahu might claim a victory in this, and it is a victory for the IDF to get Sinwar, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=414.94s)]
*  and it will take out an obstacle towards peace. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=420.53999999999996s)]
*  But we're left with a region that is absolutely devastated right now. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=423.64s)]
*  Israelis, Lebanese, and mostly Palestinians, including the West Bank. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWxjVhd4hVc&t=427.9s)]
