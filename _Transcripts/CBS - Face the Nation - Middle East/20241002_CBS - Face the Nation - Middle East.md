# Navy releases video showing U.S. destroyer intercepting Iranian missiles launched at Israel
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY)
*  Let's now ride our video monitors to the Middle East and a question that really was a big question at the start of that vice presidential debate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=0.0s)]
*  A breaking point in tensions after Iran launched as many as 200 ballistic missiles into Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=6.5s)]
*  The big question of whether Israel will respond really appears to have an answer at this hour. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=12.1s)]
*  CBS News hearing from Israel, a vow to deliver what they call a very painful response. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  And Israel is not alone in this. The White House is now echoing that very same message. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=23.2s)]
*  You just heard President Joe Biden talking about sanctions there on the tarmac on his way to North Carolina. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=28.3s)]
*  Severe consequences promised by the United States. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=33.5s)]
*  Look at this. Listen to this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=36.7s)]
*  Our monitors have this new video and the sound showing us the very moment US Navy crews in that region launched missiles in defense of Israel during that Iranian attack. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=39.300000000000004s)]
*  Darkness. And then watch this. The fire in the night. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=49.6s)]
*  Every one of these projectiles launched to try to take down an Iranian missile. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=53.6s)]
*  And right now it does appear that US muscle took down a lot of those Iranian missiles before they could hit key targets in Israel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=58.7s)]
*  So let's go live now to Tel Aviv where that sky lit up with those missiles. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=67.3s)]
*  You just saw CBS News digital international reporter Haley out with us now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=70.8s)]
*  Haley, we're glad you're okay. Israel promising a major response there. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=74.9s)]
*  What do we know about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=78.8s)]
*  The short answer is not very much. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=84.5s)]
*  Netanyahu vowed that Iran would pay for its barrage of missiles that it launched at Israel. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=88.4s)]
*  But that's about all the detail that we got. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=95.5s)]
*  Israeli officials have said that enemies of Israel throughout the Middle East should know that Israel can reach them. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=98.3s)]
*  And if they don't understand that yet, they soon will. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=104.9s)]
*  But those are the kinds of statements that we are hearing today. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=107.9s)]
*  And we're not expecting to get any more details of any sort of Israeli response before it begins. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=110.8s)]
*  And that is what is so concerning to people who are watching this conflict and worrying that we could be at a point where it spirals out of control. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=116.89999999999999s)]
*  So we've seen a lot of response there in the sky in some of that video as we watch the sky right now where you are reporting for any action. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=125.89999999999999s)]
*  But we also understand that Israel has announced moving further troops to the border with Lebanon, the ground game, so to speak. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=132.8s)]
*  So let's keep it focused on that ground combat in Lebanon. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=139.3s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=142.0s)]
*  Yes, so today, as so many people have been thinking about what Israel's response to Iran might be, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=146.9s)]
*  its operations in Lebanon and in Gaza have continued. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  The ground operation in Lebanon is continuing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  There have been strikes on both sides of the border. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=158.0s)]
*  And today Israel announced its first casualties in that operation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=160.70000000000002s)]
*  Eight IDF troops who have died and Israeli strikes in Gaza have continued today. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=164.5s)]
*  Dozens of people have been killed in those strikes, which are ongoing as well. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=170.1s)]
*  So, Haley, before we let you go, we're mindful that while this all plays out, Hamas continues to hold hostages. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=174.6s)]
*  And every one of those hostages has a family that's terrified and worried. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=180.5s)]
*  Your reporting with the families of those hostages goes back almost a year. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=184.6s)]
*  How are these families reacting to this news? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=188.1s)]
*  Yes, I spent a few hours today with one of the families that I met soon after the October 7th attacks. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=190.0s)]
*  They've spent the past year trying to get the six members of their family, some of them killed, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=196.5s)]
*  some of them taken hostage by Hamas, back home. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=201.3s)]
*  They've succeeded with all but one of their family members. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=204.5s)]
*  And today is actually Rosh Hashanah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=207.8s)]
*  That's the Jewish New Year. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=209.7s)]
*  So they were preparing for a big family meal and they're going to leave a seat empty for one of their families. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=210.7s)]
*  They're going to leave a seat empty for one of their family members at that meal this evening. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=217.5s)]
*  That person is still being held in Gaza. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=222.3s)]
*  They say and the people that they're working with, other family members of people who have been taken hostage, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=224.1s)]
*  say that they're going to continue pushing for some sort of deal to get their family members released. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=230.3s)]
*  All right, Haley, thank you so much for that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  We're mindful of the October anniversary of the terrible attacks by Hamas in Israel [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  and thinking about those families and so many people affected by all of this violence. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=245.1s)]
*  Haley, be safe yourself. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHjFoItZRY&t=248.9s)]
