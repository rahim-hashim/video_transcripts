# Israeli military says it struck more than 300 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4)
*  There are growing fears of an all-out war in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=0.0s)]
*  The death toll is climbing in Lebanon as Israel and Hezbollah exchange attacks across Israel's [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=3.56s)]
*  northern border. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=9.08s)]
*  The latest attacks are prompting concerns of increased violence spreading across the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=10.08s)]
*  region. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=14.44s)]
*  The Israeli military claims to have hit more than 300 Hezbollah targets. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=15.44s)]
*  Officials say the group has hidden weapons in residential buildings. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=19.68s)]
*  Lebanese health officials say upwards of 270 people were killed and more than 1,000 injured [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=23.28s)]
*  in the strikes. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=28.44s)]
*  It marks the single deadliest day of fighting in nearly 20 years. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=29.58s)]
*  BBC News Middle East correspondent Lina Sinjab is in Beirut. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=34.62s)]
*  Lebanon's Sinjab joins us for this. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=37.78s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=39.46s)]
*  What is the situation in Beirut right now? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=40.66s)]
*  Well, it's a very tense situation. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=45.82s)]
*  As you mentioned, today was the deadliest in the south. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=48.14s)]
*  More than 300 locations were targeted. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=52.34s)]
*  Just before I come on air, there was a targeted attack here in Beirut in Dahye, in south of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=56.099999999999994s)]
*  Beirut, in Hezbollah stronghold. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=62.42s)]
*  The Israeli officials are saying that they've targeted a Hezbollah figure, but we still [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=65.5s)]
*  don't know about the damage that this attack has caused to civilians because these areas [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=71.86s)]
*  are condensed with the civilian population. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=78.1s)]
*  Exactly that's what happened today in the morning, airstrikes that happened in the south, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=81.3s)]
*  the deadliest since this war started. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=87.17999999999999s)]
*  It targeted towns and cities and villages where it's condensed with civilians. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=90.98s)]
*  Women and children were killed and thousands and thousands of people are on the flee again. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=96.9s)]
*  Some of them have fled for the third time since this war started and have nowhere to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=102.5s)]
*  go. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=107.14s)]
*  People who are fleeing to other cities and some are arriving in Beirut, this whole country [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=108.14s)]
*  is now on alert and on emergency fearing for more escalation to come. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=113.18s)]
*  Hezbollah has vowed to continue launching rockets at Israel until a ceasefire is reached. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=118.62s)]
*  Is there any other statements that we're getting from Hezbollah on whether they are going to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=124.14s)]
*  ratchet up their retaliation? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=129.18s)]
*  Well, this is the statement that has been consistent by Hezbollah since the war started [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=131.34s)]
*  in Gaza since last year. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=139.5s)]
*  And they've been launching rockets from southern Lebanon on Israel as well. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=142.06s)]
*  They have done this in a way that is calculated so that they continue with their statement [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=147.7s)]
*  in support of the Palestinians, but also not to cause huge damage that will reach them [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=154.8s)]
*  to a point where the whole country could be dragged into a full fledged war. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=160.54s)]
*  But that's different since last week, since the attacks, the pager detonation that left [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=166.1s)]
*  at least 3,000 people injured and dozens killed and followed by bombing in Dahye as well, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=171.84s)]
*  killing top leaders of Hezbollah. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=181.72s)]
*  And just now as well, today is the deadliest day and another airstrike in Dahye. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=184.26s)]
*  So all of this would leave Hezbollah under pressure to retaliate, to respond in a way [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=190.44s)]
*  that will save their position. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=196.12s)]
*  But at the same time, they are also under pressure internally from people in Lebanon, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=199.76s)]
*  whether supporters of Hezbollah who've paid the high price since this war started or by [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  the ordinary Lebanese that no one ever wants this country to be dragged into a full fledged war. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=209.32s)]
*  That said, how concerning is this latest escalation, this sort of back and forth for the broader [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=216.38s)]
*  situation in the region? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, this region has been going into this tension for a long time, but this recent war [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  in Gaza have made regional and border countries are on edge. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=232.78s)]
*  We've had the Yemenis involved, the Iraqis involved, the Iranians threatening. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=238.46s)]
*  We've had assassinations even in Iran happening. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=243.96s)]
*  Of course, Syria is also in the calculation where constant bombardment and airstrikes [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=246.16s)]
*  targeting also Hezbollah figures inside Syria. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=251.0s)]
*  But Lebanon is the country that is more fragile and more at a hostile situation given the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=254.84s)]
*  proximity of the border and the tension with the Israelis and given that Hezbollah's stronghold [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=262.52s)]
*  is here in Lebanon. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=269.36s)]
*  This is their fertile land basically for their commandment, but this is what is putting Lebanon [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=272.0s)]
*  on the brink of a war and really the days to come, maybe the hours to come will be decisive [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=278.96s)]
*  in the fate of this country. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=288.08s)]
*  Lina Sinjab, thank you. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdcAdzNyUF4&t=289.47999999999996s)]
