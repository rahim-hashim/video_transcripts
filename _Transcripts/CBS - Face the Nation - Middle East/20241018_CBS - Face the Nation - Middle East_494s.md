# IDF spokesperson recounts Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's movements before death
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU)
*  Let's dig a little deeper into this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to bring in IDF International spokesperson Major Dodon Spielman to talk about what is [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=2.02s)]
*  happening on the ground right now. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  Sir, thank you so much for spending some time with us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=8.86s)]
*  I know you're incredibly busy. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=10.9s)]
*  But tell us—I find it remarkable that, with all the technology, all the intelligence that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=12.5s)]
*  the IDF has, that essentially—and you know this as an officer in the Army—that three, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=19.26s)]
*  really, really good soldiers just on patrol ultimately found CINWAR unexpectedly. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=26.54s)]
*  And that is kind of remarkable in any type of military operation. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=33.06s)]
*  But as you know, it happens frequently. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=36.72s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Vlad. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=40.8s)]
*  You know, I think that CINWAR didn't fall from the sky. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=42.84s)]
*  That would have been a great stroke of good luck. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=46.76s)]
*  We did have some good luck, though. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=48.82s)]
*  And these were not standard patrols. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=50.34s)]
*  We have to understand that the IDF was operating on the assumption that there were terrorist [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=51.86s)]
*  commanders of Hamas operating in that area of southern Gaza, which is known as Rafah. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=56.74s)]
*  We were acting on that intel. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=63.019999999999996s)]
*  And the way that we moved forward through this area was restricting the movements of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=64.02s)]
*  those terrorists to a narrower and narrower corridor with the hope that senior terrorists, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=67.82s)]
*  obviously, CINWAR being the most amongst them, would leave their tunnel hideouts and try [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=74.1s)]
*  to seek shelter in another area like a fugitive and make a mistake. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=78.84s)]
*  And in fact, that plan did work. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=83.28s)]
*  We were lucky that it was CINWAR that did this. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=85.92s)]
*  He moved into a building that had already been shelved. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=88.0s)]
*  He was hiding out of the building with two other people. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=90.52s)]
*  In fact, they made—he made his last mistake, which was that they actually fired towards [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=93.28s)]
*  Israeli troops, attracting our attention. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=99.16s)]
*  As we came closer, they threw grenades at our troops. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=101.96s)]
*  We then shelved the structure. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=104.6s)]
*  CINWAR was separated from the other two people who were guarding him. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=106.44s)]
*  He fled with money and IDs. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=109.76s)]
*  He's sitting in the chair exactly as you're showing on the screen. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=111.96s)]
*  Our drone moves into the room and shows us that there is a Jihadi terrorist who was there, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=115.08s)]
*  tries to throw something at the drone, at which point a shell is fired by a tank towards [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=120.12s)]
*  the building. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=124.88s)]
*  And the evil mastermind of October 7th, who is Israel's Osama bin Laden, was thankfully [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=125.88s)]
*  eliminated. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=132.52s)]
*  So it wasn't all luck, but trust me, we'll take whatever luck we can get. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=133.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=137.16s)]
*  And thank you for that play-by-play of that video, giving us the details of what we're [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=138.16s)]
*  actually seeing on the screen there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=141.84s)]
*  So now let's talk about the concerns of what this means for the fate of the hostages. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=145.08s)]
*  It's been reported that the last time the IDF got close to CINWAR, he had surrounded [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=152.0s)]
*  himself with some of those hostages. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=156.88s)]
*  And during his attempt to flee, he had those hostages brutally executed. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=159.58s)]
*  I don't know if you can confirm that, but that is the reporting that we've seen. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=163.44s)]
*  And so now, of course, folks who are worried about their loved ones are concerned about [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  the fate of the remaining hostages. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  What is your understanding? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=174.72s)]
*  First of all, all of us are not only concerned, we're torn apart personally by these hostages. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=175.72s)]
*  Just to put this in perspective, Israel is a country the size of New Jersey. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=182.12s)]
*  It's a total population of 10 million people. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=186.44s)]
*  To have over a thousand people killed and 250 hostages, 101 of which remains, each family, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=189.4s)]
*  including my own, those families whose children are hostages or grandparents who are hostages. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=195.88s)]
*  It's the first thing we wake up in the morning and think to, and it's the last thing we go [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=200.84s)]
*  to think about before we go to sleep at night. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=204.56s)]
*  It's an incredibly difficult situation. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=206.96s)]
*  We understand at its very core. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  CINWAR and Hamas took those hostages to use them as a bargaining chip. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=211.6s)]
*  They are the last bargaining chip that they're going to use. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=215.6s)]
*  They could care less about the lives of these hostages, and there is no goodwill here whatsoever. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=218.22s)]
*  We along this campaign have been operating surgically to try and rescue our hostages. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=222.74s)]
*  We've managed a few times. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=227.5s)]
*  However, the key to this very well may be what happened last night with the toppling [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=228.94s)]
*  of CINWAR and all of his terror operatives seeing the head of that organization fall. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=233.18s)]
*  It disables that organization. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=239.34s)]
*  It causes it to shake, to be a shakeup. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=241.5s)]
*  And as the prime minister said, as President Biden said in Kamala Harris, there could be [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=243.57999999999998s)]
*  an opportunity here. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=247.94s)]
*  We're able to move this to the next level. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=248.94s)]
*  We want to bring our people home, but we cannot give Hamas a pass. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=251.82s)]
*  There can be no ceasefire that enables that terror entity survive in Gaza. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=257.06s)]
*  If that happens, the next round of hostages is just waiting around the corner. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=261.2s)]
*  Let me ask you about this, Major. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=266.34s)]
*  The IDF, as you know, is obviously continuing its operations in Gaza. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=267.53999999999996s)]
*  But so people will look at this, and it's not just Yaya CINWAR that you've been able [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=271.3s)]
*  to take out. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=276.3s)]
*  You've taken out many, including predecessor leaders of this organization and others. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  Do you feel that you're achieving your objectives, your military objectives? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=283.7s)]
*  I know the ultimate objective is to bring those hostages home and to destroy Hamas. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  But how do you feel you are along the path, the military as a whole? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=291.22s)]
*  So first of all, we have to understand we're facing an enemy, which is Iran, the largest [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=295.98s)]
*  sponsor of state terrorism in the world. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=299.54s)]
*  We are being attacked on seven fronts by Iran. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=301.66s)]
*  That if Iran thinks that Israel's vulnerable, like they felt on October 7th, that's when [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=305.3s)]
*  they launched their terror entities against us. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=310.06s)]
*  What have we shown? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=312.42s)]
*  And this is in direct answer to your question. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=313.42s)]
*  We have eliminated now Hassan Nasrallah, Yahya CINWAR, Mohammed Def, which is his number [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=315.12s)]
*  two, and Ismael Khenia, the previous head of Hamas that was in Beirut, along with hundreds [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=320.26s)]
*  of other Hamas leaders. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=326.98s)]
*  And the message is very clear. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=328.1s)]
*  And this is an important military message. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=329.54s)]
*  If you think you're going to threaten Israel, you might run, you might try to hide, hide [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=333.1s)]
*  even behind your own innocent civilians or in tunnels. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=337.34000000000003s)]
*  Eventually, we will find you and you will face justice. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=339.86s)]
*  That is an important message to terrorists or to anyone thinking about being a terrorist. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=343.62s)]
*  That should dissuade them from entering into this foray. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=348.42s)]
*  At the same time, we have made phenomenal military progress. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=351.42s)]
*  Our troops have moved forward through Gaza, eliminated much of Hamas. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=354.82s)]
*  But we are not at the day after until we can reach the day before the day after, which [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=359.5s)]
*  is the complete dismemberment of that military organization. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=363.66s)]
*  Major Spielman, one other thing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=368.5s)]
*  The United States has asked Israel or has warned Israel that it faces a potential of [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=370.1s)]
*  stoppage of military support if it does not do more to allow aid into Gaza in the coming [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=375.98s)]
*  weeks. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=381.38s)]
*  Can you explain to the American people what you are doing to ensure that not only more [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=382.44s)]
*  aid is entering Gaza to those civilians who need it, those innocent civilians, those children, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=386.7s)]
*  but that the aid is actually reaching those who need it, which are not the terrorists, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=392.09999999999997s)]
*  but the people who are trapped under the boot of those terrorists? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=396.42s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=400.09999999999997s)]
*  We take the United States' concerns very seriously. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=401.38s)]
*  I myself take them very seriously. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=404.38s)]
*  And Israel takes the concerns also of the Gazan people very seriously. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=406.06s)]
*  We have sent in thousands of tons of aid since the beginning of this war, and we're continuing [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=409.91999999999996s)]
*  even today. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=414.14s)]
*  We had over 60 trucks of aid reach into northern Gaza. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=415.36s)]
*  The situation is incredibly difficult because still, whatever remains of Hamas, their first [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=418.52000000000004s)]
*  priority is to get their hands on that aid. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=424.12s)]
*  Also, all the humanitarian agencies, whether it be the United Nations agencies, in most [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=426.56s)]
*  cases have not been helpful. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=431.64s)]
*  They've been unhelpful about distributing that aid. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=433.40000000000003s)]
*  And so it's an incredible challenge. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=436.2s)]
*  However, we've taken it very seriously. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=437.72s)]
*  We've ramped up as much ability as we can to allow that aid into Gaza. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=439.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't want to see these pictures on the screen any more than you do. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=444.32s)]
*  This was really Sinwar's plan. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=447.47999999999996s)]
*  He was hoping that he would starve his own people so that world pressure would come on [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EmGAzfRCdU&t=448.88s)]
