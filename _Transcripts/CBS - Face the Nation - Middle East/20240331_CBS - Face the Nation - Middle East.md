# World Food Programme's Cindy McCain says they need "full, unfettered access" into Gaza
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [March 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0)
*  One of the international aid groups working to get relief into Gaza is the World Food Program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=0.0s)]
*  And on Friday, we asked its executive director, Cindy McCain, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=4.8s)]
*  what needs to change on the ground so her teams can operate there. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=8.48s)]
*  We need access. We need full unfettered access. And right now we don't have that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=12.8s)]
*  We can occasionally get a few trucks in. We can occasionally get up all the way to the north. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=18.56s)]
*  But it's not consistent and it is not to scale either. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=23.6s)]
*  All of the other issues regarding maritime and air drops and all those are all good. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=27.76s)]
*  We need any way to be able to get food in any way we can. But they can't take it to scale. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=33.52s)]
*  We really need access to the road and we need to be able to get up to the north all the way [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=39.36s)]
*  without being caught at checkpoints and turned around. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=44.0s)]
*  I read the World Food Program estimates simply addressing the basic food needs will require at [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=47.2s)]
*  least 300 trucks to enter Gaza every day and distribute food, especially in the north, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=51.84s)]
*  as you mentioned. But you've only managed to get about nine convoys of trucks in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=57.6s)]
*  since the start of the year. That's nothing, right? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=63.2s)]
*  It's nothing. It really is. We were able to yesterday or today, I guess it was, get nine [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=66.88000000000001s)]
*  trucks in period. We also were part of an air drop today that was 6.1 metric tons. That's nothing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=72.48s)]
*  We just cannot continue this way. As you know, famine is eminent in the north. And so unless we [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=79.92s)]
*  can really convince our diplomatic groups and our political groups around the world to help [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  convince the Israelis that we must get in and we must do it in a sustained and unfettered way, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  people are going to die otherwise and they already are dying. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=102.16s)]
*  When you or your colleagues speak with Israeli officials about getting that access, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=104.8s)]
*  what is the reason they're giving you why they're not letting you in? Do they not [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=111.28s)]
*  understand the situation or is there some other reason? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=114.88s)]
*  Well, I'm not really sure where the mistake has been made, but I do know that there's been [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=119.44s)]
*  accusations that somehow the UN isn't doing their job, which couldn't be further from the truth. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=124.96s)]
*  So I think, again, it's politics. I think it's something that various factions are involved in. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  All I need to know is when and where we can take the food in, make sure that we can distribute it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=139.92s)]
*  That's what I want to know from the Israeli government. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  You're especially concerned as well about what's happening in parts of Africa, specifically Sudan, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  South Sudan, and Chad. And you've said this could become the world's largest hunger crisis. Why is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=151.83999999999997s)]
*  that? Well, quite frankly, it's the forgotten crisis now. Sudan is no longer paid attention [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=157.12s)]
*  to in the world media and things haven't stopped there. People are still fighting. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  There is no food. We have no access. And we're also fighting a climate change issue there as well. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=170.16s)]
*  So it's almost a combination of a perfect storm with 2.2 million refugees across the borders [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=176.96s)]
*  in various countries, especially Chad, and the funding sources that we have right now and our [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=184.08s)]
*  ability to be able to fund. It just isn't matching. We don't have enough money and we need to be able [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=190.08s)]
*  to make sure that we can feed the refugees that are across the border and also get access into Sudan [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=196.08s)]
*  from the Western side, the Southern side through South Sudan and through the North. We've got to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  get food in there as well because it can be and will be, I hope not, I pray not, the next [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=208.8s)]
*  largest humanitarian crisis that we will know. And not only humanitarian crisis, you've suggested [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=216.08s)]
*  it could be a real national security risk for the United States, right? Very much so. People [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  migrate. The bad guys get mixed up in all of this. Food is the major element here in being able to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=227.84s)]
*  keep populations stable and keep them healthy as well. With those two things not tended to, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=234.64s)]
*  then people migrate, they run, they take their families, they do anything they can to feed their [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=240.48s)]
*  families. You've made an interesting point that I think is a good reminder to all of us that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  these hunger crises around the world are not being caused by natural disasters, but by man-made [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  events and conflict. And nowhere right now, perhaps at least in this hemisphere where we sit, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=258.8s)]
*  is that most apparent than in Haiti. What is the situation there as you understand it? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=265.92s)]
*  It's catastrophic. We WFP are still in there and we still are working in the North somewhat and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=272.48s)]
*  somewhat down towards the center. But it is a very dicey situation. We are continuing our school [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=279.92s)]
*  feeding programs. But once again, as you've seen, there have been evacuations of UN personnel [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=286.56s)]
*  out of there. It's just, again, this is a diplomatic solution. This is a man-made crisis [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=292.16s)]
*  and we need a diplomatic solution to it. And we need it now. We need it right now. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=297.92s)]
*  We'd be remiss if we didn't ask you while we have you about the death of the late Senator [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=303.6s)]
*  Joe Lieberman, who of course was such a good friend to you and to your late husband. What [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=309.6s)]
*  did he mean to the McCain family? Oh, he was Uncle Joe to my children. He was a friend to my family. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=313.84s)]
*  And I had the extreme opportunity of watching two men together, not only navigate the difficulties [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=322.64s)]
*  that the world offered up to them in what they did, but also watch them solve problems together [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  in a way that was gracious and kind and loving towards humanity. And I had the good fortune [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=336.96s)]
*  being able to call him my friend too. Executive Director Sidney McCain of the World Food Program, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=343.2s)]
*  thank you for joining us. Thank you for having me. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vvBUvQ7hT0&t=348.08s)]
