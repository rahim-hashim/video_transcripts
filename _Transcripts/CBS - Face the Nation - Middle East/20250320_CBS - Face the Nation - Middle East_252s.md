# Israel resumes military operations in Gaza after 2-month ceasefire with Hamas
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco)
*  The Israeli military says it's intercepted a missile that was launched from Yemen by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=0.0s)]
*  as according to reports from Reuters. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  And the projectile had reportedly been heading towards Jerusalem. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=8.02s)]
*  The White House says President Trump, quote, fully supports Israel's actions in Gaza, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=11.38s)]
*  after the IDF resumed ground operations in the war-torn territory yesterday. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=15.52s)]
*  The Israeli military says it is targeting Hamas infrastructure and weapons sites, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=20.02s)]
*  and has vowed to, quote, open the gates of hell in Gaza [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=24.7s)]
*  if the remaining hostages aren't returned and Prime Minister Netanyahu's demands aren't met. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=28.3s)]
*  As a response, Hamas fired its first wave of rockets at Israel in months. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=33.3s)]
*  Israeli officials say no casualties have been reported. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=37.3s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Rami Enessencio has more. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=40.58s)]
*  Yes, Israel's military threatened to unleash hell on Gaza this week, and it is now delivering. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=44.02s)]
*  At least 58 people were killed in a third night in a row of airstrikes up and down the Strip, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=51.260000000000005s)]
*  taking the death toll to roughly an estimated 500 people since the ceasefire was shattered on Tuesday [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=56.7s)]
*  with Israel's shock pre-dawn missile barrages. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=62.300000000000004s)]
*  Early morning reports came in today of more airstrikes near southern Khan Yunis and Ra'afa, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=66.3s)]
*  which is on Egypt's border. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=71.18s)]
*  Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has warned Gaza to return the hostages and expel Hamas, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=72.58s)]
*  the alternative being total destruction and devastation. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  However, collective punishment is a violation of the Geneva Conventions and deemed a war crime. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=82.92s)]
*  In reaction to Israel's renewed bombing of Gaza, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  Houthi militants in Yemen claimed that they fired a hypersonic missile at Israel before dawn this morning. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=92.02s)]
*  We here in Tel Aviv were jolted awake at about 4 a.m. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=97.82000000000001s)]
*  This was the second Houthi missile directed here in three days, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=100.92s)]
*  and this new attempt targeted Ben Gurion International Airport just south of Tel Aviv. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=104.2s)]
*  The Houthis also claimed that they targeted the USS Harry Truman aircraft carrier strike group right now in the Red Sea. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=109.25999999999999s)]
*  Also overnight, the U.S. struck targets in Yemen's capital of Sana'a. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=115.56s)]
*  That's according to Houthi-run TV. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=119.44s)]
*  At least nine women and children were wounded in one residential neighborhood. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  That's according to the Houthi-run Health Ministry. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=125.34s)]
*  U.S. Central Command says operations are still continuing 24-7 [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=127.34s)]
*  after the Houthis started to target Israeli ships in the Red Sea. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=131.74s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=135.14s)]
*  Remy and Asensio, thank you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=136.74s)]
*  I want to bring in Mark Kansian for more on this. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=138.94s)]
*  He's a senior advisor with the Defense and Security Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=141.44s)]
*  Mark, thank you so much for joining us today. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=147.14s)]
*  OK, so kind of play this out for me. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=149.54s)]
*  I mean, from a strategic standpoint, is this offensive, a negotiating tactic, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=151.34s)]
*  or do you think this is the return to what we saw in an earlier phase of the war? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=155.84s)]
*  I think it's the latter. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=162.34s)]
*  It's more than just negotiating tactic. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=164.04s)]
*  I think that Israel is uncomfortable with the previous negotiations. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=166.54s)]
*  They had thought that they might destroy Hamas and therefore could withdraw and get its hostages back. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=172.64s)]
*  It looks like Hamas is still active. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=179.73999999999998s)]
*  And when the Israelis leave, they will take back over. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=183.04s)]
*  The Israelis find that unacceptable. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=186.84s)]
*  I mean, what does this mean for the future ceasefire negotiations? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=190.14s)]
*  Because let's remember there are still hostages there. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=194.04s)]
*  There is pressure on Netanyahu from his own people to get those back. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  There is, but I think Israel has made a judgment that they can put pressure on Hamas. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=203.54s)]
*  President Trump is backing the Israelis very strongly, so they feel secure in that support. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  And the number of hostages left is not that great. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  It's probably something between five and 20 hostages still alive, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=221.24s)]
*  and there may be another 30 or 40 bodies to be recovered. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=226.04000000000002s)]
*  And I think when Israel looks at that, as much as they would like to get their hostages back, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=230.14000000000001s)]
*  but facing the prospect of a Gaza that is returned to Hamas control, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  they're deciding to attack Hamas, trying to get a better deal. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=241.84s)]
*  Mark Kensey, I really appreciate your time. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=247.34s)]
*  We're going to be following this very closely. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cplzAgaco&t=249.04s)]
