# Israel and some allies decry International Criminal Court for arrest warrants
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc)
*  Allies of Israel are rejecting the International Criminal Court's decision to issue arrest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=0.0s)]
*  warrants from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's former defense minister Yoav [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Galant. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=10.0s)]
*  Prosecutors with the ICC accused the Israeli officials of using starvation as a weapon [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=11.0s)]
*  amid the war in Gaza. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=15.52s)]
*  The court also accused a Hamas commander of crimes against humanity, although Israel claims [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=17.36s)]
*  they killed him in an airstrike over the summer. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=21.88s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Debra Pata has more from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=24.16s)]
*  Debra. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=27.92s)]
*  More than a dozen European countries have said they will comply with the war crimes [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=29.32s)]
*  arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court against Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=33.400000000000006s)]
*  and his former defense minister Yoav Galant. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  The Hague's allegations of grave crimes against humanity are unprecedented in Israel and have [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=42.52s)]
*  triggered a furious response here, with Netanyahu calling them anti-Semitic. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=48.64s)]
*  While the trial cannot be held in absentia, the 124 ICC member states are required to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=54.48s)]
*  arrest Netanyahu if he enters their territory. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=61.16s)]
*  The Israeli leader will still be welcome in the US, which is not a member of the ICC, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  but less so in European capitals, where even some of Israel's allies have indicated they [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=71.08s)]
*  will uphold international law. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=77.16s)]
*  Hungary, however, has broken ranks with the European Union and invited Netanyahu for a visit. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=79.88000000000001s)]
*  Israel legal expert Ayal Gross says that while it might be uncomfortable for Israelis to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  see their leaders accused of war crimes, they need to look long and hard at how the war [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=92.28s)]
*  in Gaza has been prosecuted. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  In Gaza, many Palestinians have welcomed the arrest warrants, saying a successful prosecution [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=101.04s)]
*  would go some way toward bringing justice for the more than 44,000 people killed and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=107.88s)]
*  the many more still facing starvation in over a year of war. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=114.36s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  All right, Deborah Pata, thank you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd joins us now for our weekly national [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  security wrap-up. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=126.88s)]
*  So Sam, what reactions have we seen from global leaders to these arrest warrants? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=127.88s)]
*  Well, we've seen a range of international reactions. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=133.11999999999998s)]
*  As Deborah just outlined, both signatories to the court and non-signatories have made [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=135.76s)]
*  statements. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=140.04s)]
*  The United States is not a signatory to the court, but President Biden did issue a statement [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=141.04s)]
*  calling the arrest warrants for Bibi Netanyahu and Youav Galant, quote, outrageous, and decrying [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  any false equivalency between actions undertaken by the Israeli government and by Hamas. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=153.11999999999998s)]
*  At the same time, across Europe, we're seeing mixed reactions. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=159.92s)]
*  Slovenia, for example, has said that they would arrest Galant and Netanyahu if they [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=163.16s)]
*  traveled in Slovenia. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=167.96s)]
*  But we've seen more mixed messages out of countries like Italy, France, the UK, and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=170.0s)]
*  Germany. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=175.92s)]
*  I will note that Italy is hosting a high-level meeting of G7 foreign ministers next week, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=176.92s)]
*  and these ICC arrest warrants are expected to take a priority topic there on the agenda. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  Finally, as Deborah mentioned, Hungary has been an outlier, and while a signatory to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=189.28s)]
*  the court has invited Netanyahu to visit Hungary, which is really just a slap in the face of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=194.24s)]
*  the court and the warrants issued against Netanyahu and Galant. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=200.16000000000003s)]
*  Well, let's turn to the war in Ukraine. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=203.44s)]
*  The U.S. eased its weapons restrictions, which Russia says adds fuel to the fire. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=205.88000000000002s)]
*  But as I mentioned, Russia is also upping the stakes. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=210.0s)]
*  So how is this all playing out in the battlefield? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=213.56s)]
*  Well, tensions certainly ratcheted up by not just Ukraine and Russia, but also by the United [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=216.6s)]
*  States and UK. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=221.04s)]
*  The United States lifted restrictions on Ukraine using long-range missiles to strike inside [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=222.56s)]
*  of Russia, and Ukraine used this new authority early this week, launching strikes with these [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=228.24s)]
*  longer-range weapons. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=233.52s)]
*  This was followed about a day later by strikes by Ukraine using UK long-range weapons into [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=235.16s)]
*  Russia as well. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  Now, the U.S. decision to issue this authorization reportedly hinged on the presence of North [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=243.52s)]
*  Korean troops on the battlefield for Russia. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=248.36s)]
*  Russia unsurprisingly was quite displeased and responded not just with vitriol. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  Russia lowered the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons in conflict and then really [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  tested a new kind of intermediate-range missile and fired it into the eastern Ukrainian city [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=261.36s)]
*  of Dnieper. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=268.08s)]
*  Now, this new missile is nuclear capable. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=269.08s)]
*  It could carry a nuclear payload. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=273.2s)]
*  However, there are indications that the Russian government reached out to the U.S. to say [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=274.2s)]
*  that this particular weapon was not nuclear armed. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=278.16s)]
*  It is very difficult to defend against, however, and while Russia likely doesn't have many [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=281.21999999999997s)]
*  of these new hypersonic intermediate-range missiles, they could present a real challenge [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=286.08s)]
*  for Ukraine on the battlefield if Russia uses them further. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=291.56s)]
*  Yeah, these stakes have just gotten exponentially higher. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=294.6s)]
*  Let's talk though, Sam, about something that's happening here in the U.S. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=299.4s)]
*  Federal prosecutors charged a Florida man with a bomb threat on the New York Stock Exchange. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  What do you know? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=306.84s)]
*  Well, the Department of Justice unsealed charges this week against a Florida man who was reportedly [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=307.84s)]
*  planning to bomb the New York Stock Exchange the week before Thanksgiving this week. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=314.0s)]
*  This individual had been on federal law enforcement's radar since February based upon a tip that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=319.42s)]
*  he was storing bombing schematics in a public storage unit in Florida. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=325.56s)]
*  Investigators did find sketches and other forms of bomb-making material in the storage [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=331.12s)]
*  unit. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=335.16s)]
*  His search history online included searching for information on how to build explosive [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=336.16s)]
*  devices and he even tried to task undercover FBI agents with finding explosive material, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  surveillance and other matters. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=346.88s)]
*  He told undercover agents that he, quote, felt like Bin Laden. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  And I will note that this individual really fits the profile of what security officials [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=352.48s)]
*  have been warning about for years, a lone offender inspired by anti-government ideology [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=356.88s)]
*  who seeks to implement a high-profile attack. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=362.56s)]
*  This individual reportedly tried to join far-right anti-government organizations like the Boogaloo [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=365.68s)]
*  Boys and the Proud Boys in the past and seems to have been inspired by a range of anti-government [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=371.44s)]
*  sentiment. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=377.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, one last question for you, Sam. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=378.47999999999996s)]
*  Police in London carried out a controlled explosion of a suspicious package near the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=380.68s)]
*  U.S. embassy. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=384.52s)]
*  How unusual is this? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=385.64s)]
*  This is not a wholly unusual occurrence. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=388.03999999999996s)]
*  Embassy security personnel as well as local law enforcement are well trained in identifying [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  potential explosive devices and taking quick action to defuse them. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=396.12s)]
*  We are in a heightened threat environment, Lana, and at this time we have no indication [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=400.12s)]
*  that there was a real threat in the immediate vicinity of the embassy. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=403.92s)]
*  All right, Sam Vinograd, thank you. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_z9NxzPvZc&t=407.64000000000004s)]
