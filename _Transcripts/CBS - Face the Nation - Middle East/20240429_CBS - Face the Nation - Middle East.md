# White House pushing diplomatic solution to free hostages held by Hamas
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8)
*  We want to go back to the war in Gaza and focus on the hostages that Hamas is still holding. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=0.0s)]
*  President Biden is stressing their importance in phone calls to Israel's prime minister. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=5.04s)]
*  More than 130 hostages remain, including five U.S. citizens. Hamas released a video of American [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=9.6s)]
*  Keith Siegel on Saturday. Chief Foreign Affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan spoke to his family. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=16.4s)]
*  Margaret, good morning. That was a very moving conversation. Good to see you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=21.52s)]
*  And good to see you, Gail. It was moving. These hostage videos are about manipulation. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=25.279999999999998s)]
*  They are about leverage. But what matters is that they are proof of life. And as soon as the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=32.16s)]
*  Saturday video release happened, I reached out to the Siegel family's team to understand what they [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=37.44s)]
*  learned. And his family strongly believes this is a critical moment for the U.S. to broker a deal [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=42.64s)]
*  with his captors. The Saturday Hamas propaganda video is proof that at least two American hostages, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=49.2s)]
*  including 64-year-old Keith Siegel, are alive. This is the first time that we're seeing him, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=59.84s)]
*  that we're hearing him. It's surreal. Hannah Siegel, Keith's niece, told me on Face the Nation [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=65.36s)]
*  that her family believes this release is a strategic decision by Hamas. These two videos [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  are a signal from Hamas that they are ready to make a deal and a reminder that there are [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=77.68s)]
*  American citizens being held, including Keith. The parents of 23-year-old hostage Hirsch Goldberg [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=82.48s)]
*  Polin were the first U.S. citizens to receive such a proof of life video last week. So many [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=89.2s)]
*  people were so emotional because they really have not thought he was alive. It would not be the first [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  time that Hamas used Americans to send a message, as they did last October by first setting free two [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=102.56s)]
*  Israeli-American women, Natalie Ranan and her mother Judith, a test case before swapping [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=109.68s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners for 105 hostages in November. Everything we do is guided by the ultimate goal [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  of bringing these hostages home. President Biden is also making public postures, releasing this [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=123.36s)]
*  photo holding four-year-old Abigail Edan, the youngest U.S. hostage released as part of that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=129.04s)]
*  U.S. Qatari broker deal. With food and medicine dangerously scarce in war-torn Gaza, endangering [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=134.48s)]
*  both Palestinians and the hostages held there, Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in the region [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  urging a ceasefire that would coincide with a hostage release. The U.S. blames Hamas for the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  stalled diplomacy, but some hostage families put blame on the politically embattled Netanyahu [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=152.72s)]
*  government. Segal's daughter told protesters that Israel's leaders should watch her dad's plea [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=159.44s)]
*  and imagine their own fathers. There have been deals on the table and they've proven elusive [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=166.48s)]
*  and I worry that that is because of Prime Minister Netanyahu. Hannah Segal told us the U.S. may soon [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=171.92s)]
*  need to act on its own. The Biden administration should think about what they can do directly to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=179.6s)]
*  bring our American citizens home. Margaret, it was just good to see that they're still alive. I love [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=185.12s)]
*  when she told you that these hostage videos are a reminder that these hostages are human. I won't [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=190.0s)]
*  forget those words. Let's talk about Secretary of State Blinken for just a second about his latest [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=195.84s)]
*  trip to the Middle East. What are you expecting from that? What are you hearing? Well, Gail, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=200.24s)]
*  he's in Saudi Arabia this morning and called the latest Egyptian brokered proposal [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=204.16s)]
*  extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel, which may actually suspend an expected military [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=209.2s)]
*  operation into southern Gaza if there is a deal. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Netanyahu faces real [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=215.6s)]
*  pressure from two far-right ministers in his government, Gail, who have threatened to quit [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  if he accepts a hostage deal. That could collapse the government potentially here [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=227.92s)]
*  and endanger Netanyahu himself. Today, Blinken urged Hamas to quickly make a decision and say yes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=232.64s)]
*  We hope that is the end result. Margaret, thank you very much. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLRbxNKos8&t=241.67999999999998s)]
