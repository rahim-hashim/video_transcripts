# Hamas says it will not attend cease-fire talks with Israel in Qatar
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [August 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs)
*  CBS News has learned Hamas will not attend tomorrow's ceasefire talks with Israel in Qatar. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=0.0s)]
*  The discussions are an attempt to restart negotiations between the two sides. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=5.44s)]
*  A Hamas representative claims it has not received reassurances from Israel that it would commit to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=9.76s)]
*  what was laid out in a July 2nd proposal. Israel still plans to send a delegation to the talks. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=14.72s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Inosentio is in Tel Aviv, Israel. So Remy, what does this [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=20.96s)]
*  stance from Hamas mean for the potential of a possible ceasefire deal? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=25.52s)]
*  And how are these talks supposed to continue without Hamas at the table? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  Lindsay, hi there. Yeah, good to see you. You know, it has to be acknowledged the anxiety [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  first around Hamas saying that they're not going to talks tomorrow, but it's important [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=39.12s)]
*  that Hamas saying that it's not going to talks tomorrow doesn't mean that they're actually [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=42.96s)]
*  totally pulling the plug on all negotiations. In fact, a diplomat briefed on these talks, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=46.96s)]
*  told CBS News overnight that Hamas is still open to talking with mediators if there is some kind of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=52.08s)]
*  breakthrough. And you mentioned that July 2nd proposal and that's important. That's basically [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=58.48s)]
*  the crux of this issue. Hamas is accusing the Israeli government of one, not even replying to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=62.72s)]
*  that proposal, two, of changing the conditions over the past six weeks. And then three, as we know, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  assassinating the chief negotiator, Ismael Haniyeh. With that said, there are people who are coming [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=73.84s)]
*  to the region. We already know that a US special envoy, Amos Hochstein, is in Beirut. He landed [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=79.92s)]
*  there today. He is trying to assuage fears there. And we also understand from another source that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=84.56s)]
*  the CIA director is supposed, William Burns, is supposed to be headed to the region, expected to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=90.16s)]
*  be headed to the region, along with the Mossad chief, Israeli spy chief, as well as Egypt spy chief. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=94.72s)]
*  So people are moving. There is the intent to talk as for what happens after tomorrow. Hamas is [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=99.2s)]
*  watching and waiting, and then we'll expect to hear what they say from then on. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=105.68s)]
*  Remy, we have been talking about a possible retaliatory strike from Iran. What do we know [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=109.12s)]
*  about the timing of that? And does that have anything to do with these proposed talks? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=114.64s)]
*  Sure. Well, we don't know the timing of that. But what we do know is that there hasn't been any [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=121.28s)]
*  public acknowledgement of Hamas saying that they're not going to talks tomorrow. If anything, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  the Iran is saying that it's holding the line. The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  earlier today, said that he said no to any kind of retreat. That was at an event to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=138.56s)]
*  religious leaders. And that was in reply to a comment that President Biden said yesterday [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=145.2s)]
*  when he was in Louisiana. He said that perhaps that he hoped a ceasefire would stop Iran from [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=151.12s)]
*  attacking Israel. And again, the Ayatollah is saying no, that that would not happen, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=157.52s)]
*  that that would be seen as a retreat. As for Hezbollah in Lebanon, we haven't heard anything [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=161.44s)]
*  from them. But again, I just mentioned US Special Envoy Amos Hochstein is there trying to encourage [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=166.56s)]
*  leaders in the government and through back channels to tell Hezbollah, stay cool. We don't [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=171.84s)]
*  want to increase tensions here that could lead to a larger war. Remy Innocencio, thank you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQkdQTvfWs&t=177.52s)]
