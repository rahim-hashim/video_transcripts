# Travis Timmerman's family speaks out after American found in Syria
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g)
*  All right, so this video from our monitors takes us to Damascus, Syria, where thousands gathered to pray for the first time since rebel groups drove out longtime dictator President Bashar al-Assad. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=0.0s)]
*  He's now former president. Those prayers that you see there are now turning to celebrations. Now this comes as we watch another side effect from that revolution. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=11.6s)]
*  And we're talking about the release of prisoners long held in captivity. One of them included U.S. citizen Travis Timmerman. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=20.44s)]
*  He told CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer he was on a pilgrimage when Syrian forces detained him these last seven months. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=28.6s)]
*  His family now speaking out about their emotional news of getting their loved one back. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=36.88s)]
*  Yes, I'm so happy. I'm hoping he calls me tomorrow. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=43.6s)]
*  And say he's OK. And I and. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  I want to come back home. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=56.080000000000005s)]
*  I had a meltdown last month and I cry all night and all day about that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  But, you know, I still have my hopes up. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=67.28s)]
*  But yeah, I was sad because I figured I wouldn't ever see him again if he was dead. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=74.76s)]
*  He said he went to the bathroom. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=81.44s)]
*  They let him go to the bathroom three times a day. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=85.44s)]
*  I kind of melt my heart. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=88.4s)]
*  I was sad about that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=95.56s)]
*  But. But I'm glad they found me. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  This is a whole huge Christmas present that we all get to hear. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=102.88s)]
*  I told my mom this morning, I was like, it's a Christmas miracle. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=108.96s)]
*  I know she is very, very ecstatic, enjoyed, overwhelmed and just beyond super excited. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=113.44s)]
*  I probably will cry and just tear up and just I just I can't wait for that day. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. OK, sorry. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  More word of families united in this world. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=132.84s)]
*  Right. Let's go to CBS News correspondent Ian Lee. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=135.6s)]
*  And Timmerman's home state of Missouri, Ian. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=138.6s)]
*  Well, the family is describing this as a dream come true. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=142.68s)]
*  The last few months have really been excruciating. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=146.92s)]
*  We heard from Travis's mother, who said that she almost had a breakdown [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=150.16s)]
*  from the worry about where her son is. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=155.28s)]
*  You know, they're so happy that he's been found alive and well. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=158.4s)]
*  They look forward to be reuniting with him. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=161.84s)]
*  His sister described it as a Christmas miracle. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=164.72s)]
*  But the family does have some questions. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=167.92s)]
*  The last time they heard from him, the beginning of the summer, he was in Budapest. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  They got a cryptic email saying that he was going to be offline for a few days. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  Then during that time, he then went to Lebanon and then tried to cross the border into Syria. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=179.6s)]
*  That's when he was detained, but he didn't tell anyone where he was going. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=185.72s)]
*  So the family really wants to know what happened between that time. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  They also want to know why he didn't contact them. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=194.2s)]
*  Travis said he had a cell phone in the prison with him and that he actually talked to his family three weeks ago. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=197.44s)]
*  But when I spoke with his cousin yesterday, she said no one in the family had heard from him. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=202.44s)]
*  So they want to know who he was talking to. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=207.68s)]
*  They also want to know why he was trying to go into Syria. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=210.04s)]
*  Now, he said he was on a Christian pilgrimage. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=213.76s)]
*  His cousin said that was something that he was looking to do. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=215.68s)]
*  But they wanted to know why he would want to go into this war zone. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=219.24s)]
*  Well, the family, though, in the meantime, is excited to welcome him back home. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  Travis does have a new niece. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=228.68s)]
*  They want to introduce him to her and have the family all back together for Christmas. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=230.4s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XA04penq-g&t=236.68s)]
