# Palestinians begin returning to northern Gaza as Israel-Hamas ceasefire holds
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50)
*  We're also following developments out of Gaza, where tens of thousands of Palestinians are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=0.0s)]
*  returning to northern parts of the enclave this morning. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=4.16s)]
*  The move comes after a dispute between Israel and Hamas over the release of a female civilian [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  hostage was ultimately resolved. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=11.92s)]
*  Remy Nascencio joins us now to discuss this from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=16.32s)]
*  So, Remy, good to see you this morning, my friend. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=20.72s)]
*  What's happening in Gaza this morning? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=23.12s)]
*  In your piece earlier on CBS Mornings, we saw thousands of Gazans streaming home, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=26.4s)]
*  sort of a reverse exodus back to their homelands. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=32.16s)]
*  The question, Gail King turned to me and said, but what are they returning to, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=34.96s)]
*  given the level of destruction that we've seen? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=45.2s)]
*  The short answer is mostly rubble is what they're returning to, because we know that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=45.68s)]
*  the IDF has been focused on northern Gaza in order to try to, in its own words, destroy Hamas. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=51.68s)]
*  And, you know, we might not really even be talking about the return of those hundreds [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  of thousands of Gazans back to their homes right now if it really weren't for [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=64.48s)]
*  a breakthrough you mentioned last night, which was mediated by the Qataris. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=68.72s)]
*  Essentially, Israel had accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire deal over the weekend, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  basically of not turning over a list of living hostages and then also not turning over one [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=79.12s)]
*  single Israeli woman, 29-year-old Arbel Yehud. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  She's believed to be the last female civilian still alive in Gaza. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  Because of that, Israel didn't open checkpoints along the corridor. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=93.76s)]
*  This is the the Netzerim corridor for two days. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=98.48s)]
*  Gazans we were seeing were amassing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=101.68s)]
*  They got stuck with what little belongings they had. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=104.56s)]
*  But the Qataris stepped in overnight, resolved all this, and that's why we're seeing this movement [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=107.76s)]
*  really massively breathtaking of all these Gazans making their way up the Mediterranean coast [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=111.76s)]
*  back home or, to your first question, really back to what's left of their home. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=117.04s)]
*  One of the things that I think people here are struggling to understand, Rami, and it [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  is common when you haven't been following the situation between the Israelis and the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=127.44s)]
*  Palestinians for many years, as you have, but it's the number of Palestinian prisoners [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=131.84s)]
*  that are being released in relation to the number of hostages being released. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=138.08s)]
*  I know people have asked me, you get one or two or three or four [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=141.52s)]
*  hostages being released and you get 200, 300, 400 Palestinian prisoners being released. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=145.6s)]
*  Can you explain that for our audience? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=151.12s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=155.12s)]
*  Well, Israeli government officials have said publicly many times that Israel is willing [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=155.52s)]
*  to pay, quote, a heavy price. That has been the buzz phrase over the past few weeks, if not longer, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=161.36s)]
*  really to try to psychologically get Israelis ready for this ratio that you talk about, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=167.84s)]
*  one to 30 if it is for an Israeli civilian. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=174.0s)]
*  And as we're seeing in this most recent hostage release, hostage swap, it is one to 50. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=178.4s)]
*  So, we will expect that these differences in numbers to be carrying on. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=185.44s)]
*  In sum, in total, there's an estimated 11,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=192.64s)]
*  Many of them have been charged with anything from murder to suspected support of terrorism, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  but some things that some people might say as menial as throwing rocks, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=205.44s)]
*  stones at Israeli defense forces. But looking ahead, we do expect that this will still be [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  this continued disproportionate ratio, if you will. But again, Israel is saying that they're [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=216.16000000000003s)]
*  willing to pay a heavy price. And just moments ago, I do want to add that an Israeli government [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=221.12s)]
*  spokesman confirmed that 25 of the 33 hostages in this current phase one, phase one of two, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=226.24s)]
*  potentially of three, are alive. That's after Hamas handed over a list which Israel has been [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=234.24s)]
*  going over. We heard early reports, but now we do have official confirmation from the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=240.4s)]
*  prime minister's office. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  AARON MATÃ‰ That is good news. Rami Inacentio reporting to us this morning from Tel Aviv. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=244.8s)]
*  Thank you, Rami. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3EyFO9PU50&t=249.28s)]
