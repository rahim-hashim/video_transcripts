# U.S. "does not want to see firefights in hospitals" in Gaza, Jake Sullivan says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [November 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E)
*  We're joined now by White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=0.0s)]
*  Jake, welcome back to the program. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=4.2s)]
*  The fighting seems very intense in and around Gaza. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=7.8s)]
*  Doctors Without Borders has called on the Israeli government to, quote, end its unrelenting [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  assault on Gaza's health system. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=17.2s)]
*  Does the U.S. believe that this is an accurate description of what's happening? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=20.28s)]
*  Is the U.S. telling Israel not to hit hospitals? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=23.84s)]
*  Well, Margaret, without getting into intelligence information, we can just look at the open [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=27.52s)]
*  source reporting that Hamas is using hospitals as it uses many other civilian facilities [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=31.48s)]
*  for command and control, for weapon storage, to house its fighters. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=37.64s)]
*  And this is a violation of the laws of war. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=42.24s)]
*  That being said, Margaret, the United States does not want to see firefights in hospitals [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=45.08s)]
*  where innocent people, patients receiving medical care, are caught in the crossfire. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=50.4s)]
*  We've had active consultations with the Israeli Defense Forces on this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=56.279999999999994s)]
*  In fact, just yesterday, the Israeli Defense Forces themselves said that they, on the record, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=59.76s)]
*  publicly said that they are looking for ways to be able to ensure the safety and security [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=64.84s)]
*  of individual patients in those hospitals while they also try to figure out a way to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=71.56s)]
*  deal with the fact that Hamas is operating in a way that's outside the bounds of any [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=77.12s)]
*  civilized concept of how you would think about using a hospital, using human shields. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=83.1s)]
*  So it's an active conversation, but the bottom line is we don't want to see firefights in hospitals. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=90.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=95.82s)]
*  You don't dispute then the Israeli assertion that Hamas has a command center underneath [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=97.33999999999999s)]
*  Al-Shifa Hospital? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=102.69999999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to get into a specific assertion related to a specific hospital because that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=104.61999999999999s)]
*  would be getting into intelligence matters, but broadly speaking, we can see from open [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=109.66s)]
*  source reporting that there is a track record, a pattern of Hamas historically and in this [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=114.3s)]
*  conflict using hospitals and other civilian facilities for these purposes. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=119.25999999999999s)]
*  I want to ask you about the hostages, roughly 240 still being held by Hamas. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=123.1s)]
*  We had the opportunity to speak with Congressman Mike McCaul from Israel where he had just [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=129.46s)]
*  met with the Israeli prime minister and he told us that Israel is considering Hamas' [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=135.22s)]
*  proposal that Israel release Palestinian women and children from prison in order to obtain [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=142.14s)]
*  the hostages held by Hamas. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=150.86s)]
*  Is that something the U.S. thinks should happen? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=153.46s)]
*  Well, Margaret, you'll understand if I'm very careful in how I answer this question because [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=156.3s)]
*  the negotiations are delicate. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=161.06s)]
*  They're high stakes. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=162.9s)]
*  What is at stake is the recovery of a significant number of innocent people, including innocent [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=164.42s)]
*  Americans currently being held hostage by Hamas, a murderous terrorist organization. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=169.38s)]
*  It is the case that there are active negotiations underway between Israel and Qatar who is communicating [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=175.06s)]
*  with Hamas and the United States is involved in those discussions, very much involved in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=182.22s)]
*  those discussions. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=187.42s)]
*  But I'm not going to get into the specifics of what's on the table, only to say that we [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=188.72s)]
*  are actively working to ensure the safe return of every American being held hostage and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=193.02s)]
*  every other person being held hostage by Hamas. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=199.02s)]
*  There are still roughly 400 Americans stuck in Gaza, according to the State Department. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=202.26000000000002s)]
*  Will they get out? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  We are determined to ensure that they get out. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=210.10000000000002s)]
*  Many have gotten out. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=212.46s)]
*  Many are still there, as you mentioned, not just American citizens, but also their immediate [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=214.02s)]
*  family members. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=217.98000000000002s)]
*  We are trying to create a circumstance where every one of them can get safe passage out of Gaza. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=218.98s)]
*  The gate has been open and closed. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=224.1s)]
*  The lists have included Americans some days and not other days. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=226.54s)]
*  But the bottom line is today the gate is open. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=229.85999999999999s)]
*  We are moving American citizens and their family members out. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=232.17999999999998s)]
*  And in the days ahead, we hope to ensure that every American who wants to leave Gaza is [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=235.57999999999998s)]
*  able to do so safely. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  Jake, this past week, a top State Department official testified to Congress that the Gaza [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=241.45999999999998s)]
*  Health Ministry's estimates of 11,000 Palestinian dead may in fact be an undercount. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=247.14s)]
*  Does the White House share that assessment? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=255.17999999999998s)]
*  We don't have fidelity on the numbers of casualties, fatalities in Gaza. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=257.9s)]
*  We don't know how many are fighters and how many are innocent civilians. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=265.41999999999996s)]
*  But as I have said before and as Secretary Blinken has said before, we do know there [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=269.06s)]
*  are thousands of innocent civilians who have been killed in the military operations that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=273.3s)]
*  began after October 7th. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=279.7s)]
*  And every loss of life of an innocent person, whether it's Palestinian, Israeli, anyone, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=281.62s)]
*  is an absolute tragedy. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=287.34000000000003s)]
*  And we grieve for every one of those lives. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=288.82s)]
*  And we continue to reinforce the proposition that Israel has the right, indeed the responsibility, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=291.3s)]
*  to go after Hamas, who continues to represent a threat to the State of Israel, but it must [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=297.34000000000003s)]
*  do so in a way that's consistent with the laws of war. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=303.02000000000004s)]
*  And Secretary Blinken also said too many Palestinians had died to date. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=305.70000000000005s)]
*  I want to zero in on the future, which I know you have talked about from day one, what will [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=310.90000000000003s)]
*  happen in Gaza next. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=316.70000000000005s)]
*  And you've pressed the Israeli government on this point. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=318.26s)]
*  Secretary Blinken has been clear that it's the West Bank and Gaza that need to be under [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=321.74s)]
*  unified control and the Palestinian Authority likely to govern that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=325.16s)]
*  It doesn't sound like the Netanyahu government is on the same page as the Biden administration [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=330.82s)]
*  because the prime minister said something very different just yesterday. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=336.38s)]
*  Well, from our perspective, the way forward, the basic principles of the way forward are [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=340.34s)]
*  straightforward. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=346.06s)]
*  And this is something that Secretary Blinken laid out publicly this past week. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=347.36s)]
*  No reoccupation of Gaza, no forcible displacement of the Palestinian people. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=351.65999999999997s)]
*  Gaza can never be used as a base for terrorism in the future and Gaza's territory should [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=357.62s)]
*  not be reduced. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=362.42s)]
*  Secretary Blinken also said that ultimately we do want to see the reconnection, the reunification [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=364.1s)]
*  of control between the West Bank and Gaza under Palestinian leadership. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=369.32s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority is the current leadership on the West Bank. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=374.6s)]
*  But ultimately it's going to be up to the Palestinian people to decide their future, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  who governs them. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=383.14s)]
*  There haven't been elections held in ages. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=384.14s)]
*  Well, that's right, Margaret, there haven't been elections held since the early 2000s. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=385.38s)]
*  But post October 7th, we can't go back to the way things were on October 6th. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=391.7s)]
*  And that goes for ensuring that Hamas cannot represent a continuing threat to Israel. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=396.68s)]
*  And in fact, Hamas spokespeople have said they want to repeat October 7th again and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=401.86s)]
*  again until Israel is wiped out, that they want to be in a permanent state of war with [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=406.5s)]
*  Israel. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=411.74s)]
*  And that's the front page of the New York Times out of the mouth of a Hamas spokesman. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=412.74s)]
*  So Israel is going to prosecute this campaign against a terrorist group. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=416.02s)]
*  But we also can't go back to October 6th when it comes to governance. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=420.46000000000004s)]
*  And it will ultimately be up to or should be up to the Palestinian people to decide [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=423.90000000000003s)]
*  what their future governance looks like. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  And that should involve a reconnection, as Secretary Blinken has said, of the West Bank [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=431.44s)]
*  and the Gaza Strip. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=435.38s)]
*  Jake Sullivan, thank you for your time. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPY_WZCR6E&t=436.38s)]
