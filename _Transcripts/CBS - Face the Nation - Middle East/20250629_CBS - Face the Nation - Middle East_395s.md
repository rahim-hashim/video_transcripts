Video Description: Amir-Saeid Iravani, Iran's ambassador to the U.N., tells "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" that Iran's nuclear enrichment "will never stop." "The enrichment is our right… and we want to implement this right," he said, as Iran is permitted to enrich uranium for certain purposes under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) which aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.

**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE)
*  We turn now to Iran's ambassador [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=0.0s)]
*  to the United Nations, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=1.84s)]
*  Amir Sayed Eravani, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=3.2s)]
*  who joins us from New York. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=4.94s)]
*  Welcome to Face the Nation. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=6.78s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=9.84s)]
*  Ambassador, can you give us [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=12.34s)]
*  some clarity? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=14.14s)]
*  Does Iran intend to reconstitute [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=15.58s)]
*  a nuclear enrichment program [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=18.88s)]
*  on its soil? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=21.12s)]
*  You know that we are a member, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=25.76s)]
*  a responsible member of the MPT, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  and according to this treaty, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=29.36s)]
*  we have the mutual rights. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=31.56s)]
*  It means that the right of one [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=33.9s)]
*  side will be the obligation [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=35.36s)]
*  of the other side. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=36.76s)]
*  In the MPT, it has been defined [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=38.46s)]
*  that we have two very explicit [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=40.5s)]
*  rights. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=42.9s)]
*  The first is that we can have [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=43.9s)]
*  research on development, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=47.14s)]
*  we can have the production [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  of uranium, and we can have [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  to use the peaceful energy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=51.72s)]
*  And the second right is that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=54.379999999999995s)]
*  the legal protection by the IEA [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  for our activity and technical [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=59.26s)]
*  cooperation for our development [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=61.12s)]
*  program. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=63.559999999999995s)]
*  And in return also, it will be [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=64.56s)]
*  two rights for the agency [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  in this regard that they should [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=69.1s)]
*  have the full access according [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=70.44s)]
*  to the Safe Cup Comprehensive [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=72.7s)]
*  Safe Cup Agreement. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=74.4s)]
*  And the second one is that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=75.6s)]
*  to preserve our peaceful [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=77.18s)]
*  nuclear activity will remain [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=79.1s)]
*  always in peaceful manner. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=81.44s)]
*  So the enrichment is our right, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=83.92s)]
*  and in our neighbor's right, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=86.52s)]
*  and we want to implement [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=88.42s)]
*  this right. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=90.56s)]
*  So you do plan to restart [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=91.56s)]
*  enrichment, that sounds like. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=93.56s)]
*  I think that enrichment will [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=96.46s)]
*  not never stop. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=97.9s)]
*  Well, when you mention MPT, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=100.76s)]
*  just for our listeners, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=103.1s)]
*  you're talking about some [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=104.7s)]
*  of the international agreements [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=106.0s)]
*  Iran has made with the U.N. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=107.2s)]
*  on nonproliferation and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=109.08s)]
*  safeguards. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=110.53999999999999s)]
*  You mentioned the U.N. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=111.74s)]
*  nuclear inspectors. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=113.58s)]
*  Secretary of State Mark [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=116.28s)]
*  Rubio released a statement [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=118.3s)]
*  yesterday saying that there were [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=120.16s)]
*  calls in Iran, this I believe [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=122.62s)]
*  is from a newspaper that the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=125.39999999999999s)]
*  Supreme Leader oversees, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  accusing our prior guest, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=128.56s)]
*  Rafael Grossi, of being [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=130.6s)]
*  an Israeli spy and calling [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=132.04s)]
*  for his arrest and execution. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=133.84s)]
*  To be clear, is Iran [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=136.68s)]
*  threatening U.N. inspectors? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=139.44s)]
*  No, there is no any threat. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=142.98s)]
*  It is a very clear law [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=144.68s)]
*  of the other parliament [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=146.32s)]
*  that they have been suspended [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=147.58s)]
*  our cooperation with IAEI [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=149.58s)]
*  because the agency has not [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=151.58s)]
*  implemented their rights, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=153.22s)]
*  their responsibility. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=155.12s)]
*  Due to this, it is a conditional [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=156.36s)]
*  law. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  And as long as this condition [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=159.72s)]
*  has not been set, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=162.6s)]
*  so our cooperation with IAEI [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=164.06s)]
*  will be suspended. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=166.06s)]
*  But whenever it's set out [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=167.4s)]
*  according to the law, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=169.94s)]
*  so we can resume our [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=172.2s)]
*  cooperation. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=174.68s)]
*  But there is no any threat [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=175.34s)]
*  against the general director [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=177.1s)]
*  of the IAEI. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=178.66s)]
*  Well, that was published [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=179.7s)]
*  in Israel in Iran's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=181.5s)]
*  Kayan newspaper. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=183.26s)]
*  Your foreign minister did also [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=185.14s)]
*  say that the IAEA and Grossi [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=186.84s)]
*  himself are malign in intent. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  Are the IAEA personnel, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=192.14s)]
*  are the inspectors already [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=194.18s)]
*  inside Iran safe? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=195.82s)]
*  And can they go back to their [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=197.82s)]
*  work of inspecting your sites? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=199.18s)]
*  Exactly, they are in Iran. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=202.22s)]
*  They are in the safe condition, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  but the activity has been [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=205.86s)]
*  suspended. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=208.3s)]
*  They cannot have accesses [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=209.1s)]
*  to our site. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=210.7s)]
*  But maybe some one, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=212.0s)]
*  it is individual opinion [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=214.5s)]
*  of the people that may criticize [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=216.38s)]
*  the IAEA or threat [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=218.38s)]
*  the general director. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=220.14s)]
*  But we criticize IAEA. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=221.44s)]
*  Our assessment is that they have [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=224.58s)]
*  not done their jobs, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=226.22s)]
*  so they failed and they prepared [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=228.46s)]
*  and pay a grave for such [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=231.02s)]
*  aggression against us. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=233.26s)]
*  I imagine that you would condemn [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  the calls for his execution. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=236.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=240.28s)]
*  President Trump... [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  He's not in court in IAEA. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, I know, and you're speaking [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=244.88s)]
*  to us from the UN. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  President Trump said Friday [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=247.4s)]
*  that Iranian officials want [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=249.32s)]
*  to meet with him personally, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=251.4s)]
*  and he said that will be soon. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=254.08s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, is Tehran [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=256.8s)]
*  planning to drop this demand [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=258.36s)]
*  of indirect communication [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=260.24s)]
*  with the United States? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  And will you begin speaking [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=263.12s)]
*  with the Trump administration? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=265.0s)]
*  See, we were in the negotiation [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=268.16s)]
*  because we know that any dispute [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=271.56s)]
*  between Iran and United States [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=274.68s)]
*  or other part of the GCPOA [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=276.32s)]
*  cannot be resolved [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=278.08s)]
*  without the negotiation [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  and using the peaceful means [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=281.56s)]
*  to resolve this dispute. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=283.8s)]
*  So we are in the negotiation [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  and we are ready [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=288.08s)]
*  for the negotiation. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=288.68s)]
*  But after this aggression, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=289.64s)]
*  it is not a proper condition [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=291.56s)]
*  for a new round of the negotiation. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=293.52s)]
*  And there is no request [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=296.16s)]
*  for negotiation and meeting [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=297.48s)]
*  with the president. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=299.92s)]
*  Well, the United States [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=302.88s)]
*  is wanting to meet with Iran [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=303.96s)]
*  to talk. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  And while the Supreme Leader [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=308.08s)]
*  issued a statement saying [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  Iran had dealt the US [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=311.48s)]
*  a slap in the face, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=312.72s)]
*  after that, President Trump said [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=314.4s)]
*  he had actually stopped [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=316.4s)]
*  Israel from going further [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=317.8s)]
*  and had stopped Israel [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=319.36s)]
*  from an attempt to kill [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=321.0s)]
*  your Supreme Leader. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=322.6s)]
*  Why not take the offer [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=324.88s)]
*  of a diplomatic lifeline [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=327.2s)]
*  because he seems to be offering one? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=329.48s)]
*  It is very gross violation [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=334.12s)]
*  of the international law [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=337.12s)]
*  that the treating the Supreme [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=338.44s)]
*  Leader of the Islamic Republic [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=340.2s)]
*  of Iran or any head of state, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=341.8s)]
*  they have impunity from any attack. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=345.24s)]
*  So we should understand [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=347.88s)]
*  what is the principle [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=351.2s)]
*  and condition for any negotiation. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=352.36s)]
*  Negotiation has its principles [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=354.68s)]
*  and it is a give and take process. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=359.2s)]
*  So we should engage [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=361.88s)]
*  in the negotiation [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=363.88s)]
*  and discuss with each other. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=364.92s)]
*  Maybe we reach to a conclusion or not. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=366.48s)]
*  But the unconditional surrender [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=369.2s)]
*  is not negotiation. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=372.08s)]
*  It is dictating [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=373.28s)]
*  the policy towards us. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=374.48s)]
*  If they are ready for negotiation, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=376.0s)]
*  they will find us ready for that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=377.88s)]
*  But if they want to dictate us, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=379.68s)]
*  it is impossible for any [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=381.64s)]
*  negotiation with them. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=383.8s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=386.0s)]
*  thank you for your time today. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  We will be watching and waiting to see [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=389.08s)]
*  if there are any [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=391.76s)]
*  diplomatic opportunities. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFt1EyHNGQE&t=392.8s)]
