# Former Trump adviser John Bolton discusses situation in Iran after U.S. strikes
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc)
*  Welcome back to The Takeout. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=0.0s)]
*  As the ceasefire between Israel and Iran remains in effect, Iran's president has enacted a [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=2.16s)]
*  law suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, that is the United Nations [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=7.24s)]
*  nuclear watchdog. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=12.6s)]
*  Earlier today, I spoke with President Trump's former national security advisor, John Bolton, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=13.6s)]
*  he was one of four in the first term, about Iran's nuclear capabilities and a lot more. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=17.92s)]
*  John, it's good to have you with us here on The Takeout. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=23.44s)]
*  There was a tremendous argument in Washington last week about the assessment of the strikes [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  by the U.S. and Israeli air forces on Iranian nuclear facilities. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=33.4s)]
*  Separate from that dogfight, what should our audience conclude about the importance of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  that, the longevity of the damage, and what it might mean for future U.S.-Iran relations? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=44.84s)]
*  Well, I think the destruction of the Iranian nuclear weapons program should have been an [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=52.84s)]
*  American goal for quite some time, and that in fact we have made the situation worse by [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=58.28s)]
*  waiting 20, 25 years before taking effective action. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=64.2s)]
*  And I think indeed if Israel had not opened the strike on Iranian nuclear and ballistic [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=67.72s)]
*  missile and air defense targets, perhaps Trump wouldn't have been forced into a decision, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  yes or no, for the U.S. to participate. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=80.68s)]
*  I think we've done pretty extensive damage. It was absolutely not total and complete [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=83.48s)]
*  obliteration, but neither was it hitting it with a feather. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=88.92s)]
*  So I think we need to be very careful monitoring, surveilling Iran over the next days to make sure [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  they don't try to restart it and to reserve the option, along with Israel, to use military force [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=99.4s)]
*  again. But to me, the next step, the next logical step to achieve peace and stability in the Middle [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=104.6s)]
*  East is that the regime in Tehran has to go, because if it doesn't, it will make every effort [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=111.32s)]
*  to rebuild the damage that's been done, whatever it was, to fix that damage in the very near future. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  John, as you well know, America First is diametrically opposed to regime change, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  or at least it says it is. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=129.0s)]
*  Well, I think Donald Trump has told us what America First is. It's whatever he says it is. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=130.2s)]
*  And in the past weeks, he has whispered the words regime change himself and even had his [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=135.48s)]
*  press spokesman in the White House use them. The real question is, what is going to bring an end [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=142.92s)]
*  to terrorist surrogates like Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, the Shia militia in Iraq? What's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=148.67999999999998s)]
*  going to bring an end to the nuclear threat that's not just a problem for Israel, it's a problem for [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=155.48s)]
*  the United States. It's the regime in Tehran that's the source of all this. And as long as that regime [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=159.16s)]
*  is there, it's going to cause trouble. And we've seen that now for 45 plus years since the revolution [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=165.56s)]
*  in 1979. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  John, does the ability of the Israelis using obvious personnel within Iran who turned on the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  regime to identify key locations of scientists and military leaders so that they could be killed by [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=180.28s)]
*  the Israelis tell you there is a, let us say, opportune moment to press for regime change? And [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=186.04s)]
*  if we were to do that, what would that look like? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  Right. Look, I think this regime is at the weakest it's been since 1979 for a variety of reasons. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  The economy since 2018-2019 has been a mess. There were widespread protests right across the country, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  brutally repressed by the regime back in those days. But the economy has only gotten worse since [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=212.28s)]
*  then. It's very, very oppressive for the people. Number one. Number two, the young people of the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  country, 60% of the population is under 30. No, they could have a different way of life. They can [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=224.11999999999998s)]
*  see it across the Gulf. And the economy has been a mess since 2018-2019. And the economy has been a [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  mess since 2009. Not even a few other countries in the Gulf in the Arab states. Three, the ethnic [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=237.8s)]
*  groups, the non Persian groups that are between 40 and 50% of the population, Azzaris, Kurds, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=245.24s)]
*  balukis, Arabs, very opposed to the ayatollahs. And then finally, people will remember the murder [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=251.16s)]
*  of Masi Amini two years ago, a young Kurdish woman who refused to wear the hijab and the protests [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=257.32s)]
*  who say they convey the word of God to the people about how they're supposed to behave. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=263.56s)]
*  And the women of Iran said, we don't hear the word of God telling us we have to wear the hijab. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=268.44s)]
*  There's a lot of division within top ruling circles in the country. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=274.52s)]
*  They're going to face a crisis when the Ayatollah Hamenei, who's 86 years old, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=278.6s)]
*  been in power 36 years, very poor health, when he goes, that is the kind of stress [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=283.52s)]
*  on the regime that could cause the thing to come apart at the top and collapse. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=290.4s)]
*  John, another topic. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  The administration has decided to withhold some armament shipments to Ukraine. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=296.91999999999996s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=303.23999999999995s)]
*  You know, I think this is a mistake. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=305.44s)]
*  I hope there'll be a strong reaction in Congress when they get the reconciliation bill out of the way. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=307.0s)]
*  These are resources previously committed. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=312.32s)]
*  The argument appears to be that if we provide some of these assets to Ukraine, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=315.12s)]
*  we will not have sufficient reserves in our arsenal to protect the United States. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=320.4s)]
*  I doubt that. I'd like to see the proof of that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=325.24s)]
*  Even if it were true, using these weapons, giving them to the Ukrainians to use against the Russians [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=327.96s)]
*  benefits the United States. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=333.32s)]
*  I feel very strongly on that point. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=334.91999999999996s)]
*  And it's an argument that we need significant increases in our defense budget, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  which the White House has not asked for in the next fiscal year request. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=341.28s)]
*  This is the worst time to show any sign of weakness to Putin as the Russians are preparing, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=345.52s)]
*  apparently, another offensive against Ukraine in its in its northwest. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=351.8s)]
*  You mentioned Congress, John, as you well know, there is a sanctions bill in the United States Senate [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=357.24s)]
*  that Lindsey Graham, its chief sponsor, says has 82 members of the Senate on it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=362.91999999999996s)]
*  All they're waiting for is a green light from President Trump. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  Will that ever come? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=372.08s)]
*  Well, I think it hasn't come yet. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=372.96s)]
*  Obviously, I think it could come. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=375.28s)]
*  I don't think Trump likes to be insulted and demeaned. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=377.28s)]
*  He still thinks, I'm afraid, Vladimir Putin is his friend, which is a mistake on his part. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=380.64s)]
*  But I think he's trying to avoid it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  But he may not be able to look in the first term, we would go to him and say, we think sanctions are necessary on Russia. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=388.47999999999996s)]
*  He'd resist mightily. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=394.88s)]
*  And then and then he'd go ahead and impose the sanctions and take credit for it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  I'd be happy if that's the way it turned out here. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=401.12s)]
*  Always a pleasure, John. Thanks for your time. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=404.64000000000004s)]
*  Glad to be with you. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw_qvo2e-fc&t=406.64000000000004s)]
