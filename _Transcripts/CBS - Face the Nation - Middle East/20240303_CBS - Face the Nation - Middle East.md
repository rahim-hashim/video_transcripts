# U.S. military carries out food airdrops in Gaza
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [March 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs)
*  We turn now to the latest on the war in the Middle East, where urgency grows to get aid into Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=0.0s)]
*  Our MTS Tayyip reports from Tel Aviv, and we want to warn you, some images are disturbing. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=6.72s)]
*  High above Gaza, three C-130 aircrafts airdropped 38,000 meals in coordination with U.S. ally Jordan. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=14.16s)]
*  On the ground, the food parcels landed on the southern end of the besieged Palestinian [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=23.12s)]
*  territory, where around one and a half million people are sheltering. A minuscule amount of food [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=28.08s)]
*  given the massive need. President Biden made the rare American humanitarian intervention [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=34.48s)]
*  after at least 115 Palestinians were killed and hundreds more wounded when Israeli forces opened [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=41.44s)]
*  fire as thousands had gathered for one of the first food aid deliveries in Gaza City in months. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=48.0s)]
*  In what Palestinian leaders are calling Israel's flower massacre, people had swarmed the trucks in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=54.56s)]
*  the desperate hope of getting a sack of flour only to be killed. The Israeli military continues [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=60.16s)]
*  to insist that deaths were caused by a stampede. But United Nations observers sent to Gaza City's [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=67.36s)]
*  Al-Shifa hospital found the majority of the dead and wounded from the convoy had suffered from [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=73.76s)]
*  bullet and shrapnel wounds. The chaos in carnage only underscores how desperate the situation [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=79.12s)]
*  across Gaza is. Since the start of the war, the Israeli military has blocked most food, water, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=85.12s)]
*  and medicine into the besieged Palestinian territory, triggering a near famine in the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=91.68s)]
*  north of Gaza, affecting hundreds of thousands, according to the UN. Including 10-year-old Yazan [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=97.12s)]
*  Al-Khfarna. His mother says he has special needs and getting just the basics like bananas and eggs [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=104.4s)]
*  to keep him alive has been impossible. I want the world to understand what we are going through, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=110.72s)]
*  she says. I want them to help my son. But until Israel agrees to allow for a dramatic increase [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  in aid through the land crossing Zik controls and distribution challenges are solved, starvation [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=123.28s)]
*  will only spread. And pressure is only growing to get a ceasefire and hostage release agreement [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=129.84s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas before the start of Ramadan next week. Both sides have signaled they [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=136.24s)]
*  may be close, Margaret, but in the words of a top national security official, until a deal is done, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=141.84s)]
*  it's not done. MTS Tayyip reporting from Tel Aviv. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHcyIH5soXs&t=148.48000000000002s)]
