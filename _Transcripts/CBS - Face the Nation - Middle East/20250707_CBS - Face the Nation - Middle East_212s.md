# Trump meeting with Netanyahu as ceasefire optimism rises
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek)
*  All right, for now, though, some other big stories. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=0.0s)]
*  he's in Washington today for talks with President Trump at the White House. Part of these efforts [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=3.52s)]
*  to secure a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza. CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=8.48s)]
*  joins us from the White House with more on this. Natalie, good morning to you once again. What can [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=14.16s)]
*  we expect to come out of this meeting today? Hi, Errol. Well, President Trump has said he [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=18.64s)]
*  believes there's a good chance that there will be a deal with Hamas this week, and that deal could [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=24.4s)]
*  see the release of quite a few hostages. Now, what we know about the framework for what's been [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=31.04s)]
*  discussed, it includes a 60-day pause in fighting or 60-day ceasefire aid for Gaza and release [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=37.92s)]
*  of at least some of the remaining 50 hostages. Prime Minister Netanyahu has said 20 of them [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  are still alive. But a big sticking point that's been reported about is would this ceasefire deal [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=52.56s)]
*  lead to a more permanent end of the fighting? We know that that's something that President Trump [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=59.68s)]
*  has said he wants to see an end to this conflict, and it's something that is expected to be [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=65.92s)]
*  discussed here at the White House later this evening when he hosts Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=72.08s)]
*  for a third time during his second term. Notably, all of the events so far are scheduled as close [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=78.0s)]
*  to the press, so we do not expect to see the leaders together unless that opens up. We also know [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=86.8s)]
*  that the Prime Minister is scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Rubio and also Special Envoy [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=94.08s)]
*  Witkoff ahead of meeting with President Trump later this evening. Yeah, it speaks to how close both [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=100.32s)]
*  Netanyahu and Trump really are. I want to turn now to all this confusion over tariffs, Natalie. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=105.92s)]
*  President Trump's original 90-day tariff pause on increases was to expire Wednesday, but now [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=112.16s)]
*  there's some word from the White House that maybe they actually meant August 1st. What's the real deal here? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=119.44s)]
*  That's right. The dates, as has happened before, seem to be shifting slightly. What we do know is [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  the president says that letters are going out today at noon Eastern to up to 15 trading partners, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=131.12s)]
*  and it seems that the aim of these letters are to get countries to kind of move things along, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=139.04s)]
*  as the Treasury Secretary said, or face those steeper tariffs that were announced back in April, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  the reciprocal tariffs, as the administration has called them. But yes, notably, those higher rates [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=152.88s)]
*  would not take effect until August 1st. So it seems as though there's a few more weeks of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=160.8s)]
*  negotiations here, but again, the administration trying to keep pressure on the top trading partners [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=167.68s)]
*  that it hopes to achieve deals with. You know, months ago we were talking, or the administration [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=174.0s)]
*  was talking about and hoping for 90 deals in 90 days. So far we have two deals that have been [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  formally announced. The UK deal, most recently the Vietnam deal, as well as that agreement or [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=186.96s)]
*  framework with China. Treasury Secretary says more deals will be announced in the next 48 hours or [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  so, but he also says that he believes the president is focused on quality over quantity. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=201.36s)]
*  All right, Natalie Brand at the White House. Thank you for that, Natalie. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNlACqB16Ek&t=208.88s)]
