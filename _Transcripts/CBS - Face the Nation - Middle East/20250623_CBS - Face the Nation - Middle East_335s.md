# Impact of Iran's missile attack on U.S. base in Qatar
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ)
*  Awar Rang, Kesha Awar Zian joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=0.0s)]
*  He is a professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic studies at New York University and the author [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=4.36s)]
*  of the book, Making Space for the Gulf, Histories of Regionalism and the Middle East. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=9.24s)]
*  Officials in Qatar have confirmed an Iranian airstrike on the U.S. Air Base in Qatar. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=14.44s)]
*  This is the largest U.S. base in the Middle East. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=19.0s)]
*  Just, you know, Professor, thank you for being here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=22.12s)]
*  What are you watching right now? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=25.38s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=28.44s)]
*  Yes, this is truly a very concerning moment for the entire region. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=29.96s)]
*  Of course, Iran is in the crosshairs and the Iranian regime, as well as ordinary Iranians, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=35.24s)]
*  are the most directly affected by everything this past week. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=40.04s)]
*  But the entire Persian Gulf region, the Arabian Peninsula, neighboring countries are all deeply [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=44.2s)]
*  affected from airspace being closed down to, as you saw recently, rockets being fired from Iran [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=49.48s)]
*  to the neighboring state of Qatar. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=58.919999999999995s)]
*  Fortunately, it seemed that it was a highly coordinated strike by the Iranians. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=62.28s)]
*  The U.S. seems to have been fully aware that this was unfolding, and we'll have to kind of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=67.24s)]
*  monitor things. I hope this is a pathway for de-escalation, and I would imagine [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  most of the leaders of countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=79.32s)]
*  Kuwait, and so forth would all want an end to the ongoing war that began in Israel, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=85.08s)]
*  Palestine, and has always obviously spread far and wide. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  Professor, everybody is asking what happens next. Is there even a remote chance that they [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=95.63999999999999s)]
*  could come back to the table for diplomacy? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think the events of the past week, and especially this weekend, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=104.52s)]
*  the direct U.S. bombing of Iran has really shaken Iranian decision makers, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=108.6s)]
*  again, as well as ordinary Iranians. So it's going to be a big ask for Iranians to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=115.08s)]
*  accept diplomacy. That was exactly what they were trying to do these past couple of months. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=120.36s)]
*  That was what they would plan to do last Sunday, which was sidelined by the Israeli onslaught. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  So to be frank, I'm not very hopeful for direct negotiations between the U.S. and Iran, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=131.16s)]
*  which is in fact what is ultimately needed if we're going to have peace in the region and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=138.2s)]
*  stability for the U.S. as well. But we're going to need other countries to step in to mediate. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  This is a very fluid situation, and there clearly are interests who don't want to see Iran and the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=153.72s)]
*  U.S. sit down engaging diplomacy. Clearly, Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu was opposed to it. He [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=160.44s)]
*  basically sabotaged any attempt of a negotiated agreement between the U.S. and Iran. So they are [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=166.04s)]
*  a major actor who, on a regular basis now, on an hourly basis, it seems like Iran and Israel is [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=175.64s)]
*  unleashing missiles and bombing various Iranian sites, including civilian sites. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=182.12s)]
*  Professor, how might this conflict in the Middle East spread even further in the Persian Gulf? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=190.12s)]
*  I think your previous commentator mentioned, obviously, that the direct issues of missiles [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=197.16s)]
*  being shot in various places, so there's the direct military clashes that may happen. But there, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=203.48s)]
*  we have to be cognizant of sabotage, of shipping. This is a major thoroughfare that's critical [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  for the global oil market, but also just generally shipping is critical in the Persian Gulf waters [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  and Indian Ocean area. And if, for instance, the Houthis in Yemen attack the Red Sea, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=226.2s)]
*  the entire global economy is vulnerable to attacks on shipping. And there are other dimensions, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  asymmetric tactics by Iran and its allies in various ways. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=240.44s)]
*  Frankly, this was a reckless decision to start to expand the war, and we're all, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=246.36s)]
*  in a sense, caught in this dilemma of not knowing exactly how to de-escalate. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=251.8s)]
*  If one wants to be positive, I think the states in the Arabian Peninsula from the GCC have all [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=256.6s)]
*  tried to issue statements the past week to temper and reduce tensions. They do have, especially [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=262.12s)]
*  states like Oman and Bazar have good working relations both with the United States and Iran. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=270.59999999999997s)]
*  They may be able to play a role in mediating and cooling the tempers a bit. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=276.68s)]
*  But this is a truly unprecedented moment. Even the Iran-Rakh war and the earlier Gulf wars [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=285.08s)]
*  didn't involve the kind of rocket fire across the entire Middle East, in a sense, in the scale [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=294.28s)]
*  of it. Of course, the number of deaths in those wars and the number of months and years of those [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=303.24s)]
*  wars was a lot longer than we've experienced. I hope we don't experience that sort of thing [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=307.88s)]
*  again. But it is very troubling, and I hope advisors both in Tehran and in Washington can [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=313.0s)]
*  impress upon the leaders how vulnerable the entire region is at this moment, and in fact, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=323.88s)]
*  the global situation. Professor, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_FbX6_UOQQ&t=330.52s)]
