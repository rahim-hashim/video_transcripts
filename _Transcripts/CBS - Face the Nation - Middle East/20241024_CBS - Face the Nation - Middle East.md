*  And we want to warn you, some of the images in her report may be difficult to watch. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=14.8s)]
*  Starved, besieged, and now forced to move again. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=19.400000000000002s)]

*  in the north. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=31.36s)]
*  Israel says it is for their own protection. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=33.92s)]
*  Residents say there is no safe place to go and no safe way to get there. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=37.64s)]
*  They fear they will never return home again. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=43.2s)]
*  They told us to leave, said Intisa Hanush, because they're going to destroy our houses. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=48.84s)]
*  We can't take it anymore, cried Lena Abunada. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=55.24s)]
*  We're being exterminated and no one is helping us. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=58.96s)]
*  We are innocent. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=62.52s)]
*  Exhausted medical staff have made urgent appeals for the world not to look away. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=65.36s)]
*  Speaking from the north, Dr. Hossam Abu Safir told CBS News the situation is catastrophic. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=72.04s)]
*  Actually, we don't have medicine, medications, medical supply, food, water, blood unit. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=79.2s)]
*  As a result, every hour someone dies in their hospital. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=87.88s)]
*  Even in the south, there are chronic food shortages. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  This was the desperate crowd of hungry people struggling to pay for bread outside a bakery. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=97.16s)]
*  There is simply not enough to go around. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  On Israel's second front in its war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israeli jets pounded the suburbs [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  of Beirut overnight. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  American emergency doctor Mohammed Sube did two missions working in Gazan hospitals and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=119.12s)]
*  is now volunteering in Lebanon. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  He told us it feels like the early days of Gaza. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=127.68s)]
*  We're seeing kind of the same playbook that was played out. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  We have received multitudes of reports on targeting of ambulances that are transporting [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=134.4s)]
*  patients from missile strike scenes to hospitals. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  This is what Lebanon's first responders deal with day in and day out, saving lives by risking [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  their own. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=155.6s)]
*  When Israel launched a wave of deadly strikes across the city of Nabateir over a week ago, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=158.4s)]
*  killing more than 20 people, as usual, it was the paramedics and firefighters who rushed [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=164.4s)]
*  in first, leading the team, their regional director Hussein Fakir, who was injured that day. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=171.08s)]
*  We were putting out fires and putting the dead and wounded from the rubble, he told us. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=180.52s)]
*  Then we went back to our base. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=185.96s)]
*  There was a strike directly next to us. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=187.88000000000002s)]
*  Fakir says 90 percent of their equipment has been destroyed and now they are losing their [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=190.88s)]
*  men. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=197.04s)]
*  He believes it's deliberate. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=198.04s)]
*  We have been directly targeted, he said, more than once. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  His nephew, Hussein Jabir, is also a first responder. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=206.16s)]
*  Seeing death up close has been tough, harder still when it's one of your own. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  That was the worst day, he said. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=217.48s)]
*  My colleague was a few meters away from me when he was killed in an airstrike next to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=219.68s)]
*  our base. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  It can't be easy when you go out each day because you're risking your life. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=225.48000000000002s)]
*  Our job is to help people, he said, to keep them safe. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=230.72s)]
*  While wrapping up our interview, there was a strike nearby. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  Just like that, Jabir was gone. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=244.36s)]
*  The duty called. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  Two hours later, he was racing to another emergency scene. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  Anyone there, Jabir yelled out? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=255.0s)]
*  Twelve bodies were pulled from the rubble. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=257.12s)]
*  Shortly after this video was filmed, Jabir was wounded in another Israeli strike. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=260.12s)]
*  His injuries were minor and they are so short staffed, he went straight back to work. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  Dr. Sube believes his government could help end all of this suffering. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=274.36s)]
*  The United States, we are not neutral. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=279.24s)]
*  We are actually arming this because without the arms that we provide, this would not happen. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=281.88000000000005s)]
*  And it is the faces of the children caught up in both these wars that haunt him. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  If you ignore everybody else, think about the child. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=293.36s)]
*  And if that doesn't move you, I feel like you've kind of lost that nucleus of what it [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=296.44000000000005s)]
*  means to be a human being. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N_1iWGd3U4&t=301.32000000000005s)]
