# Sen. Bernie Sanders: "No more money to Netanyahu's war machine to kill Palestinian children"
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [March 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw)
*  We are coming off a big week in politics, but there are challenges ahead, particularly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=0.0s)]
*  with the war between Israel and Hamas reaching a critical point as the holy month of Ramadan [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=6.68s)]
*  begins. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  And we turn now to that crisis in the Middle East and renewed fears of violence in Jerusalem. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  I do want to note that we have an extensive bipartisan conversation with the chairs of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=18.16s)]
*  the Senate Intelligence Committee that will be coming up in a moment. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=22.84s)]
*  We're going to begin with Senator Bernie Sanders from Burlington, Vermont. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=26.72s)]
*  Good morning to you, Senator. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=31.08s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=33.28s)]
*  You have long been a critic of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=35.14s)]
*  The other night, President Biden was heard on a hot mic after the State of the Union [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=40.78s)]
*  address saying he has to have a come to Jesus talk with Netanyahu about letting humanitarian [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=45.56s)]
*  aid into Gaza. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=51.56s)]
*  Have you spoken to President Biden about whether he's had this conversation? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=53.56s)]
*  If he hasn't, what is he waiting for? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=58.56s)]
*  And if he already had it, has it made any difference? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=60.88s)]
*  Well, I've spoken to people very high up in his administration. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=64.08s)]
*  Here's the bottom line. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=68.92s)]
*  Margaret, what we are seeing in Gaza today is literally an unprecedented crisis. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=70.16s)]
*  It's not just that 30,000 people, two thirds of them are women and children have already [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  been killed. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=80.46000000000001s)]
*  We are looking at the possibility of hundreds of thousands of children starving to death. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=81.76s)]
*  The United States of America cannot be complicit in this mass slaughter of children. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=89.56s)]
*  So it is one thing to talk to Netanyahu, to pressure Netanyahu, but here is the bottom [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  line. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=102.12s)]
*  Year after year, we have provided billions of dollars in military aid to the government [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=103.2s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  You have a right-wing extremist government under Netanyahu. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=109.72s)]
*  There are plans to provide him with another $10 billion in unfettered military aid. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=114.19999999999999s)]
*  Well, you can say to Netanyahu, stop the slaughter, allow the massive amounts of humanitarian [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=121.52s)]
*  aid that we need to come in to feed the children. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=128.04s)]
*  Please, please, please. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  Oh, but by the way, if you don't do it, here's another $10 billion to continue the war. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  Now, we have written a letter to the president. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=136.6s)]
*  It turns out that Israel is in violation of the law. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=138.8s)]
*  Stopping American humanitarian aid is in violation of the law. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=142.36s)]
*  That should be clear. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  No more money to Netanyahu's war machine to kill Palestinian children. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=147.36s)]
*  You said Israel's in violation of the Foreign Assistance Act, as have a handful of other [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  Democratic senators. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=155.96s)]
*  They may also be in violation of the Leahy Act. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=157.52s)]
*  The president himself has the national security powers to suspend. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  Do you really think, though, in a presidential election year that the president of the United [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=166.26s)]
*  States would halt or pause or condition aid to one of the closest allies in the Middle [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=170.26s)]
*  East? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=175.78s)]
*  Well, I think it is the right thing to do. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=176.78s)]
*  You can't beg Netanyahu. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=180.38s)]
*  You got to tell him if you want any money, you got to change your policy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=182.17999999999998s)]
*  Allow the trucks to come in to feed the children. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=185.85999999999999s)]
*  By the way, in terms of politics, which is secondary to my mind in this issue, the truth [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=188.78s)]
*  is whether you're a conservative Republican or a progressive, you do not want to see children [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=194.38000000000002s)]
*  in Palestine starve to death. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=199.78s)]
*  So I think it's good politics and it's the moral and right thing to do. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  Do you stand by your view that a full ceasefire with Hamas is unrealistic because that terror [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  group seeks to destroy Israel? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=212.82000000000002s)]
*  Look, what you have, what you need right now is a ceasefire tomorrow so that the trucks, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=215.26000000000002s)]
*  the massive amount of humanitarian aid can come in to feed the people who are starving. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=222.94s)]
*  But you have Hamas is dedicated to destroying Israel, yet the Netanyahu government, which [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=228.38s)]
*  is dedicated to destroying Hamas, I think at the end of the day, Hamas cannot be continuing [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=233.78s)]
*  to run Gaza and the Netanyahu government cannot continue to run Israel if we're going to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=240.24s)]
*  ever bring peace to that region. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=245.42s)]
*  But a temporary ceasefire is sufficient for you? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=247.96s)]
*  To feed the children right now is what we've got to exactly do. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=252.5s)]
*  OK, yesterday, President Biden was asked about Israel's plans to launch an operation into [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=255.38s)]
*  the southern city of Rafa in southern Gaza. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=260.82s)]
*  Listen to what he said. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=265.46s)]
*  Would invasion of Rafa, would you have urged him not to do? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=267.97999999999996s)]
*  Would that be a red line? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=271.18s)]
*  It is a red line, but I'm never going to leave Israel. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=272.65999999999997s)]
*  The defense of Israel is still critical. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=276.26s)]
*  So there's no red line. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=278.26s)]
*  I'm going to cut off all weapons so they don't have the Iron Dome to protect them. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=279.9s)]
*  They don't have. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=283.46s)]
*  But there's red lines that if it crosses, it cannot have 30,000 more Palestinians dead. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=284.46s)]
*  Was that clear to you in terms of where that red line is and what do you make of it? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=292.58s)]
*  Look, Margaret, 1.7 million Palestinians, 80 percent of their population, have been [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=299.02s)]
*  driven from their homes and displaced. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=306.94s)]
*  Many of them end up in Rafa. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=310.58s)]
*  To go in there and to displace them again and start a major military campaign would [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=312.14s)]
*  be an unmitigated disaster. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=317.65999999999997s)]
*  So my view is, of course, we cannot support an attack of that kind on Rafa. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=320.73999999999995s)]
*  Bottom line is, though, Netanyahu has got to be told no more money for his war machine [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=325.85999999999996s)]
*  unless there is humanitarian aid coming in to feed the people. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=331.17999999999995s)]
*  Well, that'll be in the hands at the moment of the House of Representatives, which hasn't [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=335.58000000000004s)]
*  scheduled a vote. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=340.26000000000005s)]
*  On the politics of this, more than 100,000 voters in Michigan went uncommitted to protest [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=342.58000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Biden's policy. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=348.38s)]
*  In the state of Minnesota, in the recent primary there, you saw a similar boycott. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=349.82000000000005s)]
*  Almost 20 percent went uncommitted. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=354.5s)]
*  Given your moral objections, your personal issues here, can you in good conscience ask [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=357.98s)]
*  your supporters to vote for Mr. Biden? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=365.14s)]
*  Well, look, the contrast that I think President Biden made it very clear in the State of the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=369.26s)]
*  Union address, if you believe that climate change is real, you've got to vote for President [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=373.53999999999996s)]
*  Biden. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=379.94s)]
*  If you believe that women have a right to control their own bodies, you've got to vote [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=380.94s)]
*  for President Biden. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=385.34s)]
*  If you think that at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, you don't give trillions [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=387.34s)]
*  of dollars in tax breaks to the 1 percent, you've got to vote for Biden. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=391.98s)]
*  If you want to lower the cost of prescription drugs, you've got to vote for Biden. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=396.02000000000004s)]
*  If you believe in democracy and involving people in the process rather than keeping [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=399.82s)]
*  people from voting, you have to vote for Biden. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=405.70000000000005s)]
*  So you're saying progressives need to put this aside? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=407.94s)]
*  I am saying we've got to come, not put it aside. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=412.1s)]
*  The fight continues to change Biden's policy in Gaza, but the contrast between Biden and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=416.1s)]
*  Trump is day and night. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=423.54s)]
*  The election of Trump would be a disaster for this country and in my view, the world. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=426.46000000000004s)]
*  We've got to come together, reelect Biden, but at the same time, we have to demand that [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=431.90000000000003s)]
*  we have a progressive agenda where we have an economy that works for all, not just a [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=436.62s)]
*  few. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=441.46000000000004s)]
*  You're standing by your endorsement of Mr. Biden's election despite the current policy. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=442.46s)]
*  No, I am not supporting Mr. Trump. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=448.41999999999996s)]
*  No, no, no, Mr. Biden. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=450.73999999999995s)]
*  The election of Trump would be a... yes, that's right. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=452.38s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, thank you for your time this morning. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=457.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfbgXeGhcdw&t=461.21999999999997s)]
