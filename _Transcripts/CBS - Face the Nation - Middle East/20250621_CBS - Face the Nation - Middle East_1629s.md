# Watch: Trump's address to the nation on U.S. strikes on Iran
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE)
*  This is a CBS News special report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  We have breaking news out of the Middle East. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  President Trump is about to address the nation. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Roughly two hours ago, he announced via social media that the United States has bombed three [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=15.92s)]
*  nuclear sites in Iran. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=21.22s)]
*  CBS is reporting six B-2 stealth fighters dropped 30,000-pound bunker buster bombs on [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=23.48s)]
*  at least one of those sites the very first time that weapon has been used in combat. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=30.64s)]
*  Today, it was to destroy an underground nuclear facility about 60 miles southeast of Tehran. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=35.8s)]
*  The president said that all American planes are safely now out of Iranian airspace. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=42.92s)]
*  These American strikes are in support of a war that Israel launched on Iran nine days [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=48.64s)]
*  ago. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=54.08s)]
*  We know tonight that the Israeli prime minister has spoken to the president, thanked him, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=55.08s)]
*  and congratulated him on the strikes. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=60.72s)]
*  We are awaiting word now from the president of the United States himself, who is expected [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=63.92s)]
*  to address the nation from the White House. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=69.5s)]
*  As we await him taking the podium, I want to go to our White House correspondent, Weijia [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=74.0s)]
*  Zhang. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=79.08s)]
*  Weijia, we know that the president returned to the White House in the 5 o'clock hour, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=80.08s)]
*  around 6 p.m. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=84.36s)]
*  He had a national security briefing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=85.6s)]
*  What do we know about what was going on at that period of time? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=87.98s)]
*  Margaret, that's right. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=91.92s)]
*  He was in his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, but came back this evening, which [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=93.6s)]
*  was actually always the plan, even when he took off for that trip. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=100.0s)]
*  And right beforehand, he said that Iran had at maximum two weeks to try to reach a diplomatic [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=105.6s)]
*  deal. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=112.64s)]
*  There was no indication at that time that he was going to follow through with the strikes. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=113.64s)]
*  But of course, that quickly changed. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=117.6s)]
*  We see the president now. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=121.28s)]
*  The U.S. military carried out massive precision strikes on the three key nuclear facilities [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=122.72s)]
*  in the Iranian regime, Fordow, Netanj and Esfahan. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=130.32s)]
*  Everybody heard those names for years as they built this horribly destructive enterprise. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=137.64s)]
*  Our objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and a stop to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=145.1s)]
*  the nuclear threat posed by the world's number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=151.44s)]
*  Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=156.64s)]
*  Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=165.16s)]
*  Iran the bully of the Middle East must now make peace. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  If they do not, future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=175.02s)]
*  For 40 years, Iran has been saying, death to America, death to Israel. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=179.84s)]
*  They have been killing our people, blowing off their arms, blowing off their legs with [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=185.32s)]
*  roadside bombs. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=189.28s)]
*  That was their specialty. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=191.44s)]
*  We lost over 1,000 people and hundreds of thousands throughout the Middle East and around [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=192.88s)]
*  the world have died as a direct result of their hate. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=198.72s)]
*  In particular, so many were killed by their general, Qassem Soleimani. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=201.68s)]
*  I decided a long time ago that I would not let this happen. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=208.64s)]
*  It will not continue. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=212.64s)]
*  I want to thank and congratulate Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=214.6s)]
*  We worked as a team like perhaps no team has ever worked before. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=219.6s)]
*  And we've gone a long way to erasing this horrible threat to Israel. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  I want to thank the Israeli military for the wonderful job they've done. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=228.64s)]
*  And most importantly, I want to congratulate the great American patriots who flew those [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=233.6s)]
*  magnificent machines tonight and all of the United States military on an operation the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=237.68s)]
*  likes of which the world has not seen in many, many decades. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=243.68s)]
*  Hopefully we will no longer need their services in this capacity. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=248.16s)]
*  I hope that so. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=252.04s)]
*  I also want to congratulate the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dan Raisen [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=253.72s)]
*  Kane, spectacular general, and all of the brilliant military minds involved in this [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=259.0s)]
*  attack. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=264.4s)]
*  With all of that being said, this cannot continue. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=265.96s)]
*  There will be either peace or there will be tragedy for Iran, far greater than we have [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=268.59999999999997s)]
*  witnessed over the last eight days. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=274.44s)]
*  Remember, there are many targets left. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=276.88s)]
*  Tonight's was the most difficult of them all, by far, and perhaps the most lethal. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=281.28s)]
*  But if peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=287.32s)]
*  speed and skill. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=293.08s)]
*  Most of them can be taken out in a matter of minutes. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  There's no military in the world that could have done what we did tonight, not even close. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=298.92s)]
*  There has never been a military that could do what took place just a little while ago. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=304.08s)]
*  Tomorrow, General Kane, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth will have a press conference [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  at 8 a.m. at the Pentagon. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=315.76s)]
*  And I want to just thank everybody. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  And in particular, God, I want to just say we love you, God, and we love our great military. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=320.04s)]
*  Protect them. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=327.8s)]
*  God bless the Middle East. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=329.12s)]
*  God bless Israel. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  And God bless America. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=334.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=335.8s)]
*  That's so. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=336.8s)]
*  I also want to... [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=341.8s)]
*  President of the United States walking away from the podium there where he had been flanked [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=344.0s)]
*  by the Secretary of State and National Security Advisor Marco Rubio, along with Secretary [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=348.48s)]
*  of Defense and his vice president announcing and congratulating the military on what he [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=352.8s)]
*  called spectacular military success in these strikes that were carried out inside Iran [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=359.32s)]
*  earlier today. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=365.6s)]
*  He said the sites were, quote, completely obliterated. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=367.2s)]
*  Now, he did seem in those remarks not to completely close the door on further military action. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=370.32s)]
*  He thanked the U.S. military and said that he hopes that their services won't be needed [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=378.04s)]
*  again. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=384.04s)]
*  And he said all of this was meant to erase the nuclear threat posed by Iran. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=385.64000000000004s)]
*  To be clear, U.S. intelligence assessment has been that Iran was not yet building a [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=390.76000000000005s)]
*  nuclear weapon, but that they had been enriching nuclear fuel at worrisome levels. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=397.48s)]
*  The international community had high degree of outcry on that point just a few weeks ago. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=403.08000000000004s)]
*  In Vienna, you had the Israeli strikes come the following day after that in the midst [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=408.04s)]
*  of what had been a diplomatic effort by President Trump and his envoy, Steve Wittkopf, to negotiate [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=413.2s)]
*  with Iran to get them to limit their nuclear program. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=420.12s)]
*  Those did not result in an agreement, though up until today, I am told, the U.S. was trying [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=424.2s)]
*  to reach out. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=429.34s)]
*  Yet, just a few hours ago, we saw these strikes carried out. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=431.04s)]
*  I want to go over to the Pentagon now, where our Charlie Dagata is. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=435.48s)]
*  And apparently, Charlie, you'll be there early tomorrow, since the president just said [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=440.28000000000003s)]
*  there will be an 8 a.m. Pentagon press conference where he will detail these strikes. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=443.72s)]
*  The secretary of defense will. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=449.68s)]
*  What do we know at this hour? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=451.72s)]
*  I know Iran is acknowledging and saying that these strikes happened, but that it will not [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=453.36s)]
*  end their nuclear program. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=458.68s)]
*  You know, Margaret, we await that briefing tomorrow. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=460.28000000000003s)]
*  We have had very few briefings here at the Pentagon, so it will be interesting to see [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=463.72s)]
*  how much detail is shared there. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=467.8s)]
*  But as—it was already shared, six bunker busters on four Dow. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=470.08s)]
*  That would have meant at least three of the B-2 bombers that we've already discussed, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=476.68s)]
*  where they came from, when they were deployed. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=481.76s)]
*  We were talking earlier today about whether they went from Whiteman, whether they were [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=483.88s)]
*  going to Guam. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=487.04s)]
*  Maybe it was a head pump, maybe it was a head shake of where this was going to go and when [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=488.56s)]
*  it was going to happen. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=492.64000000000004s)]
*  Something like 30 Tomahawk missiles at two other sites there. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=494.6s)]
*  They've been called massive precision strikes. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=500.6s)]
*  I think what we need to know—and I'm not sure whether that is knowable at this point—is [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=504.08000000000004s)]
*  how damaging that was, if the White House is to be believed, whether it crippled and [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=508.68s)]
*  entirely took out Iran's nuclear capabilities at four Dow and Tans in Safran. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=515.4s)]
*  He's calling it a spectacular success. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=521.36s)]
*  But the other thing we need to be concerned about now is he mentioned when he took out [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=523.88s)]
*  Qassam, the assassination of Qassam Soleimani, when he was president. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=528.12s)]
*  And we saw the retaliation then across multiple American targets. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=533.8399999999999s)]
*  There are 40,000 U.S. service members spread throughout the Middle East, and they have [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=539.12s)]
*  come under attack before. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=545.3199999999999s)]
*  We've already known, even leading up to this, because it was always a what if, but [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=547.32s)]
*  leading up to where we are now, we've been speaking to people here at the Pentagon, DOD, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=552.0s)]
*  saying, if there is an Iranian retaliation, how are we postured? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=557.48s)]
*  How is the United States postured to defend against that? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=562.64s)]
*  There are multiple, multiple—in fact, I can't remember how many times or how—the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=566.0s)]
*  last time we've seen this many military assets flooded into that area in order to [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=571.24s)]
*  defend against a possible Iranian retaliation to protect U.S. forces there. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=576.48s)]
*  No, no doubt that force posture has been really built up in these past few days. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=582.36s)]
*  At the same time, it was just this morning that we heard the U.S. ambassador to Israel, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=587.92s)]
*  Mike Huckabee, announce with detail for the very first time how Americans in Israel could [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=593.6800000000001s)]
*  actually safely get out. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=599.44s)]
*  The U.S. government brought about 70 of them by plane to Greece, evacuating them from the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=601.4399999999999s)]
*  area. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=607.8s)]
*  The airspace over Israel has been closed for days, so it has made it hard for people to [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=608.8s)]
*  leave if they wanted to, because there has been this back and forth with Iran's retaliation [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=614.68s)]
*  against Israel, some of those missiles piercing their defenses, those U.S.-provided defenses [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=620.56s)]
*  in many ways. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=626.0s)]
*  And I know it has been remarkable, Charlie, that whether we're talking to current or [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=628.92s)]
*  former officials, they all seem to say, it's amazing we haven't yet seen retaliation. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=633.92s)]
*  We haven't yet seen a strike against a U.S. base or U.S. assets. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=639.5s)]
*  Now that the United States has entered this conflict in this way, that may change. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=645.8s)]
*  And I have no doubt that there is a bracing for what could be coming next. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=652.8s)]
*  I spoke to some diplomats in the region just within the past hour, and I was told there [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=656.96s)]
*  wasn't much of a heads-up given to some of our allies there. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=661.88s)]
*  Just to remind people, Charlie spoke about 40,000 U.S. military personnel in that region [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=666.12s)]
*  of the world. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=671.1600000000001s)]
*  The fourth largest military installation America has in the world is in Kuwait, very close [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=672.44s)]
*  there to Iran, very significant naval assets in Bahrain, a lot of American families stationed [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=677.46s)]
*  there. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=685.0400000000001s)]
*  It's not just Israel. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=686.12s)]
*  It is the surrounding Arab countries that the U.S. is allied with who are holding their [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=687.12s)]
*  breath tonight, wondering if hosting those American forces also makes them a target. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=692.5999999999999s)]
*  So we are going to be watching all those bases that you see there on the screen, as well [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=699.48s)]
*  as some of the other American assets in the region. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=704.98s)]
*  I also just want to acknowledge here that while the president has been saying this was [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=709.48s)]
*  a successful strike, we don't yet know what the end game is here. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=714.2s)]
*  We don't know that from the United States, and we don't know that from the nation of [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=719.0s)]
*  Israel either. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=721.92s)]
*  The goal was stated to be destruction of Iran's nuclear program. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=723.44s)]
*  Tonight you have out of Iran statements from their atomic agency saying that this national [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=727.68s)]
*  industry, as they refer to it, will not be stopped, that you can't kill knowledge. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=734.12s)]
*  There have been, of course, assassinations of nuclear scientists, as we know. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=741.2399999999999s)]
*  We want to go now on the phone. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=745.8s)]
*  We are joined by General Frank McKenzie, who was the combatant commander there in the Middle [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=747.68s)]
*  East for so many years. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=755.3599999999999s)]
*  General McKenzie, I hope you can hear me now. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=757.1999999999999s)]
*  I know you have literally gamed out this scenario for years when you were in the job. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=760.0799999999999s)]
*  What are those U.S. military families, what are those soldiers and navalmen, what are [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=767.18s)]
*  they bracing for tonight? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=774.42s)]
*  What should we expect with the light of day? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=776.18s)]
*  Good to be with you tonight. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=778.3s)]
*  I've worked on this plan for 15 years. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=781.66s)]
*  It looks like a successful strike. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=784.28s)]
*  As you noted, we'll know more in the hours and days ahead how successful it actually [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=786.02s)]
*  was. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=790.9s)]
*  But what the central command commander right now is most concerned about is the possible [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=791.9s)]
*  Iranian response. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=796.06s)]
*  What's it going to be? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=797.06s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=798.9799999999999s)]
*  And a lot of the thinking over the last few days, I'm sure in the Department of Defense, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=799.9799999999999s)]
*  has been how to prepare for that inevitable Iranian response. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=804.5s)]
*  And so we've flowed forces in. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=808.9s)]
*  We'll be ready for it. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=810.18s)]
*  What we want to do is avoid a significant loss of American life that would then push [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=811.18s)]
*  us up the escalatory ladder. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=816.8599999999999s)]
*  So we want to save the Iranians from themselves. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=818.9s)]
*  We want to maintain balance in the region if we can. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=821.56s)]
*  And that's what the CENTCOM commander is going to be working on right now. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=824.42s)]
*  I would also note that Iran is gravely weakened as a result of their exchanges with Israel [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=827.5799999999999s)]
*  over the past few weeks, and in fact, over the last year or so. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=832.9799999999999s)]
*  So this is a very significant, very significant thing to bear in mind as we look at what the [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=836.6999999999999s)]
*  Iranians might do in response. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=841.42s)]
*  The final thing I will say is this. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=843.8199999999999s)]
*  The Iranians have held all the lower cards on the escalation ladder. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=846.18s)]
*  But the simple fact is this. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=850.7s)]
*  We hold all the higher cards on the escalation ladder, as does Israel, and the Iranians know [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=852.38s)]
*  that. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=857.3000000000001s)]
*  Well, General, to that point, I was speaking to an Iran analyst just a day ago who described [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=858.3000000000001s)]
*  this regime as homicidal but not suicidal, meaning they would restrain themselves from [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=863.4200000000001s)]
*  a head-to-head conflict with the United States. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=868.24s)]
*  As you just pointed out, they are in such a weakened position because of the conflict [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=871.26s)]
*  over the past year or more. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=875.6s)]
*  That had to have factored in to the calculation tonight. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=879.8000000000001s)]
*  Do you think President Trump is being overconfident if he thinks this is one and done? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=883.32s)]
*  I think President Trump actually has unique and powerful credibility on this issue. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=888.8000000000001s)]
*  He noted the strike on Qassem Soleimani, which I really believe was the correct action at [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=893.24s)]
*  the time. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=898.6s)]
*  I was responsible for carrying out his orders on that strike and really began the arc of [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=899.6s)]
*  taken us to this point where Iran is on their back foot and in a very grave danger of even [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=904.44s)]
*  surviving as a state. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=911.2800000000001s)]
*  I think that's something to understand as we take a look at it. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=912.9200000000001s)]
*  I think we should remember that the primary goal of Iranian statecraft is preservation [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=916.96s)]
*  of the regime. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=922.08s)]
*  Different times before, this regime has chosen to step back when faced with the possibility [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=924.36s)]
*  of regime destruction. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=930.8800000000001s)]
*  I think they're rapidly approaching that point right now. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=932.44s)]
*  And I think this measurably moves us forward to that end. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=935.48s)]
*  We have learned here at CBS that there was some advance notice that was on past to Iran [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=939.48s)]
*  about these strikes. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=946.6s)]
*  But as I said, there wasn't full diplomatic notice being given to all of the allies in [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=949.6400000000001s)]
*  the region. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=954.0s)]
*  You ran that operation in 2020 when, as you mentioned, Qassem Soleimani was taken off [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=955.6s)]
*  the battlefield. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=961.88s)]
*  How much visibility does the United States have for what comes next? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=964.76s)]
*  How good is our intelligence in terms of the threat picture? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=968.02s)]
*  So, Margaret, our intelligence is very good. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=971.3199999999999s)]
*  Penetration of Iran by human sources and other sources is very good. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=976.28s)]
*  We're going to have a good feel for what the Iranians are thinking. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=980.12s)]
*  The other factor that's out there is much Iranian leadership is dead now. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=983.0799999999999s)]
*  And the Iranians have, because of their corrupt system of promoting officers and keeping them [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=987.8399999999999s)]
*  in place, they don't have a good succession plan inside their military. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=991.92s)]
*  So people go into a job and they stay 10, 12, 15 years while they're growing rich from [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=996.04s)]
*  that job. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1000.4s)]
*  So those people are now dead. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1001.4s)]
*  But they haven't groomed a successor. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1003.24s)]
*  So that makes it very hard for the Supreme Leader to formulate decisions and to transmit [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1004.56s)]
*  those decisions to the Iranian military. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1010.24s)]
*  And that will further complicate Iranian responses, I believe, in a days and weeks [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1012.92s)]
*  from now. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1016.68s)]
*  Thank you, General. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1017.68s)]
*  And just to clarify for our audience, as we were talking about the killings of top Iranian [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1018.68s)]
*  officials, many of them have been military leaders. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1025.08s)]
*  We were showing you a picture there of the Supreme Leader, Qassem, we were talking about [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1028.96s)]
*  Qassem Soleimani, we were talking about the Supreme Leader just now, showing you a picture [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1032.92s)]
*  of him. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1036.58s)]
*  We do not know his whereabouts at this hour. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1037.58s)]
*  He has actually not been seen in public for a few days now. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1039.7s)]
*  He had this video address that we are showing you. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1043.8s)]
*  But he is at 86 years old, dealing with cancer. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1047.02s)]
*  And all of our reporting is that he has been very hard to contact. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1050.78s)]
*  In other words, the top levels of Iranian government aren't sure where their boss is. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1055.6200000000001s)]
*  At this hour, we do not know his whereabouts. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1060.1000000000001s)]
*  When we're talking about succession planning, that is the man, that is the main decision [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1062.82s)]
*  from which all things flow. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1068.4s)]
*  And so this question of what comes next is going to be really important to think about [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1070.8000000000002s)]
*  as we look at who else may be able to give orders or not give orders. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1077.16s)]
*  We want to speak to Samantha Vinograd, who I'm told is joining us as well right now, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1082.94s)]
*  a national security contributor to CBS. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1087.8000000000002s)]
*  She also joins us on the phone. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1090.8400000000001s)]
*  She's a former assistant secretary for counterterrorism at Homeland Security. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1093.1s)]
*  And Sam, I know you served before that on the National Security Council as well. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1097.78s)]
*  There has been so much reporting around the threat in the United States over the past [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1103.82s)]
*  few years, the risk to officials involved with actions against Iran, the risk of sleeper [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1108.54s)]
*  cells here in the United States. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1115.56s)]
*  When we talk about retaliation, should we be thinking about the homeland? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1118.26s)]
*  Margaret, I am deeply concerned about the potential for retaliatory attacks here in [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1123.1s)]
*  the homeland by Iran. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1127.98s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program has certainly taken a hit. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1129.98s)]
*  We will await the battleground assessment to understand how deep that hit was. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1132.9s)]
*  But we do know that Iran is likely going to rely on its asymmetric advantage in this conflict [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1138.14s)]
*  with the United States and Israel, which is its proxies all around the world. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1143.5s)]
*  Iran has for decades had the both intent and the ability to direct and inspire individuals [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1148.4199999999998s)]
*  to attack American, Israeli, and Jewish interests and assets all around the world. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1156.4599999999998s)]
*  During my time at Homeland Security, we tracked myriad Iranian threats here in the homeland, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1161.86s)]
*  as mentioned, against former government officials involved in the strike against Qasem al-Mahdi, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1166.58s)]
*  against dissidents, against journalists, against the Saudi ambassador during the Obama administration, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1172.1799999999998s)]
*  and against everyday Americans. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1178.22s)]
*  So right now, while Iran has certainly taken a hit to its nuclear program and military [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1180.22s)]
*  installation, it is likely that they will rely on their asymmetric advantage in this [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1184.5s)]
*  context, which is their proxies, to try to send a signal to the United States and to [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1189.3400000000001s)]
*  the rest of the world that they just aren't going to take this hit without any kind of [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1194.5s)]
*  response. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1198.98s)]
*  Now, how significant their reprisals will be is something the intelligence and law enforcement [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1199.98s)]
*  communities are likely looking into, but I am concerned about the threat here in the [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1207.46s)]
*  homeland. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1210.46s)]
*  Yeah, I'm looking at an email now from our Homeland Security correspondent, Nicole Skanga, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1211.46s)]
*  detailing some of the law enforcement officials throughout the country who say they have not [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1216.7s)]
*  yet been given any kind of briefing in regard to possible downstream effects. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1221.1799999999998s)]
*  But as you point out, that doesn't mean there isn't one. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1227.6599999999999s)]
*  In fact, I was speaking to a U.S. official earlier today who said that this administration [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1229.9399999999998s)]
*  has shown a higher risk tolerance when it comes to things like this than past administrations. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1235.42s)]
*  That was in reference to the security of Americans abroad. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1242.14s)]
*  As we noted there, Sam, it was just earlier today that the U.S. ambassador to Israel announced [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1246.02s)]
*  the details of how to leave Israel right now with U.S. government chartered flights. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1251.46s)]
*  Is that a little late in the game? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1259.26s)]
*  If you have an American family member in the region right now, how worried should you be? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1260.88s)]
*  Well, Margaret, on your first point, law enforcement intelligence professionals were already on [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1265.62s)]
*  heightened alert as it pertains to the Iranian threat, just based upon the strikes against [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1269.54s)]
*  Qasem Soleimani and just various Iranian threat streams that were around even when I was at [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1275.1399999999999s)]
*  DHS ending in 2023. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1279.98s)]
*  So while they should get a briefing on downstream effects, they are already very aware of Iranian [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1282.3799999999999s)]
*  capabilities in this context and likely monitoring social media, encrypted platforms, and other [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1286.94s)]
*  sources to see if they can find any leads on specific threat streams following these [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1292.62s)]
*  military strikes. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1298.34s)]
*  Now, I will tell you that we have had operational plans to evacuate Americans from the region [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1299.34s)]
*  for years and certainly post-October 7. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1305.1399999999999s)]
*  Those operational plans were ready to go, and I was very surprised that they were not [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1308.4599999999998s)]
*  implemented sooner based upon Israel strikes against Iran and what we knew to be potential [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1312.78s)]
*  strikes against Americans in the region. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1318.6999999999998s)]
*  As soon as President Trump took the decision to launch these strikes, I would have expected [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1321.5s)]
*  him and his National Security Council to immediately begin to actively evacuate Americans, not [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1326.1s)]
*  just from Israel, but potentially from Lebanon, from Egypt, from Iraq. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1331.22s)]
*  Iran is obviously more complicated, just knowing that Iran will be looking for opportunities [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1335.8999999999999s)]
*  to harm Americans, whether that's through violence, through kidnapping, through harassment, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1340.54s)]
*  and otherwise. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1345.46s)]
*  So it wasn't a question of the operational plans not being ready. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1346.46s)]
*  There's a question of the State Department deciding to implement those plans, the Department [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1349.62s)]
*  of Defense helping to operate them. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1354.62s)]
*  And I think that is unfortunately too little too late based upon the cauldron that is in [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1357.1s)]
*  Middle East right now. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1361.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1363.34s)]
*  Well, those are some cautionary words at this hour, Sam. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1364.34s)]
*  We know that Americans were ordered out of U.S. Mission Iraq a few days ago, but when [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1368.82s)]
*  it came to some of those other posts, there are still plenty of Americans working, living, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1375.58s)]
*  and many of them with families as well. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1381.82s)]
*  We're going to continue to track what's happening there in the region. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1383.62s)]
*  And I want to go now to the White House, where we find White House correspondent Weijia Jiang. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1387.6599999999999s)]
*  Weijia, I know from the rundown here we saw the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1392.98s)]
*  State, a number of key advisors, including the CIA Director. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1399.06s)]
*  And there has been a very public back and forth that the president has had, disputing [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1403.8600000000001s)]
*  publicly the findings of the intelligence community when it came to assessing whether [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1409.3600000000001s)]
*  or not Iran was actually making a weapon or whether it was, as the U.S. intelligence [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1415.64s)]
*  community said, wanting to be a threshold state. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1421.64s)]
*  In other words, give themselves the option to get a weapon, but not actually building [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1425.08s)]
*  one. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1429.84s)]
*  That comes back to that question of why this military action last Thursday and why this [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1430.9599999999998s)]
*  action now. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1435.1599999999999s)]
*  And Margaret, we've been really trying to drill down on that very question during this [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1436.9599999999998s)]
*  past week because President Trump gave a very specific timeline. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1441.28s)]
*  He said that Iran was just weeks away from having a nuclear weapon. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1445.6799999999998s)]
*  And so I asked during the last White House press briefing, Caroline Levitt, what he meant [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1451.04s)]
*  by that. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1457.0s)]
*  Does that mean that Iran was getting close to having enough enriched uranium, which is [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1458.16s)]
*  required to build that weapon, to start making a bomb? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1463.44s)]
*  Or is Iran just weeks away from actually finishing the production of a weapon? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1468.4s)]
*  And she said that it would only take two weeks if the Supreme Leader gave the green light [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1476.52s)]
*  for Iran to have that weapon. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1484.84s)]
*  And as you pointed out, that contradicts what we have heard from the IAEA, which of course [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1487.4s)]
*  monitors all the nuclear sites around the world, which recently said that Iran was not [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1495.6000000000001s)]
*  actively pursuing a nuclear bomb and also flies in the face of what the director of [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1501.8s)]
*  national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, testified. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1507.92s)]
*  Now, she did talk about those high levels of enriched uranium. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1511.2s)]
*  That is very different from saying they actually are close to a bomb. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1515.9199999999998s)]
*  But that is what the president said. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1519.28s)]
*  That is what this administration said. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1521.08s)]
*  And so we will be asking for more details because that is so important to answer the [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1523.1599999999999s)]
*  why of why now, Margaret. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1527.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1529.9199999999998s)]
*  And an important question many lawmakers will be raising as well. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1530.9199999999998s)]
*  We know that lawmakers have not been briefed. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1534.6599999999999s)]
*  They are scheduled to be briefed in the House and Senate on Tuesday by the director of national [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1538.08s)]
*  intelligence along with military leaders on exactly how all of this came about and [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1542.28s)]
*  the justification for it. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1547.52s)]
*  We know as of this evening that the top leadership in Congress hasn't fully been briefed, or [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1549.3999999999999s)]
*  at least the Democrats who are in that so-called gang of eight, those who lead the parties [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1554.8s)]
*  in both houses and then also have oversight of the intelligence committees. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1560.8s)]
*  The Republicans have told CBS that they have been briefed. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1565.3999999999999s)]
*  The Democrats have not. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1568.58s)]
*  That further, of course, will raise questions about any kind of politics here on such a [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1570.96s)]
*  significant issue of national security. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1577.4s)]
*  This tonight, no doubt, has been the most significant national security and foreign [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1581.4s)]
*  policy decision the president of the United States has made in this second Trump term. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1587.44s)]
*  We'll be tracking all of what comes next very closely, and we'll be bringing it to you here [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1594.24s)]
*  on CBS. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1600.2s)]
*  Our coverage will continue on CBS News 24-7, your local news on this CBS station, and of [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1601.4s)]
*  course first thing tomorrow on CBS Sunday morning and with me on Face the Nation. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1608.72s)]
*  This has been a CBS News special report. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1614.48s)]
*  I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp36IcusPE&t=1616.96s)]
