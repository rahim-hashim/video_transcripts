# Democratic Sen. Van Hollen says he's "pleased" about Harris' statement on Netanyahu meeting
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18)
*  We're back with Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, great to have you here at Face the Nation. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Let's begin with your colleague, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  He was on Face the Nation just a few minutes ago. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=9.72s)]
*  We were talking about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his visit to the United [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  States. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=16.52s)]
*  We're glad to have you here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=17.52s)]
*  You've been so outspoken on Israel and its handling of its war with Hamas. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=18.52s)]
*  He was pretty clipped in talking about why he didn't shake Netanyahu's hand. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=23.34s)]
*  He said, I just wanted to recognize the relationship between the U.S. and Israel, but he did not [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=27.12s)]
*  say he had any regrets about making that formal invitation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  Do you agree with the senator's take on all of this, with the Netanyahu visit or not? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=36.44s)]
*  Well, Robert, it's good to be with you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=41.04s)]
*  And just to be very clear, yes, I've been critical of the conduct of the war in Gaza, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=43.72s)]
*  but always affirmed Israel's right to self-defense, in fact, duty to self-defense. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=50.22s)]
*  So look, the message that I got from my trip to Israel nine days ago, where I met with [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=56.0s)]
*  hostage families, was don't be used as a political prop by Bibi Netanyahu in an address [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=62.12s)]
*  to Congress that will help boost his very low popularity ratings in Israel at a time [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  when he and his extremist colleagues, Smotrich and Ben-Gavir, are not prioritizing the return [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=76.76s)]
*  of the hostages. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=83.58s)]
*  They're not prioritizing a ceasefire and return of the hostages. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=84.76s)]
*  So they encouraged me, many of them, to express my views in support of the people of Israel [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=90.76s)]
*  by not participating in what they saw was a political ploy by Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  So that's what I did. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  You said they told you to not be used as a prop. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  Do you believe Congress was used as a prop by Netanyahu? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=108.04s)]
*  I do think. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  I think Prime Minister Netanyahu accomplished his goal of using Congress as a prop to boost [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=112.36s)]
*  his support in Israel, especially among his right-wing extremists. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=117.64s)]
*  If you saw the people who gave two thumbs up to his speech, they were Ben-Gavir and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  Smotrich. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=126.84s)]
*  These are very right-wing extremists. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=127.84s)]
*  Was it a mistake for Democrats to support him coming to Congress? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=130.72s)]
*  I believe it was. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=136.48s)]
*  I've expressed that view, but the reality is obviously he came. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=137.6s)]
*  So for those of us who thought it was a mistake to have him here, we expressed our views by [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=142.84s)]
*  not participating. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=149.2s)]
*  And again, that was the message I got not only from hostage families, but I also met [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=151.16s)]
*  Robert with a lot of Israeli families whose loved ones were victims of the October 7th [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=157.04s)]
*  Hamas attacks, who told me that neither Prime Minister Netanyahu or any member of his government [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=164.28s)]
*  had come to see them, had reached out to them. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=171.08s)]
*  And their message to me, as I said on the Senate floor at a speech last week, was before [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=175.2s)]
*  he comes to the United States Congress, have him come look us in the eye and explain his [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=180.68s)]
*  responsibility in the intelligence failure that made the Hamas attack even worse. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=187.8s)]
*  You're so frustrated with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=193.52s)]
*  Should the president refuse to meet with Netanyahu in the future? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=196.2s)]
*  He met with him this past week. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=198.8s)]
*  Where should the line be drawn now with Netanyahu? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=201.04s)]
*  Well, my view is that we need to really stand up and confront the extremist policies of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=203.72s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu and Smotrich and Ben Gavir. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=209.76s)]
*  And again, that's the message we're getting from many in Israel. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=213.44s)]
*  I mean, while you had people in the Congress standing up and giving Netanyahu big applause. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  Real affirmation. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=223.84s)]
*  You had people in the streets, Israelis in the streets, protesting the fact that Netanyahu [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  and his right-wing extremists, who've been, they've been very clear that they don't prioritize [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=232.12s)]
*  the return of the hostages. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=236.52s)]
*  You had Israelis protesting that fact. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=239.0s)]
*  And the message to me was if you really want to take a pro-Israel position right now, you've [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=241.44s)]
*  got to confront the very extreme positions of Netanyahu and Smotrich. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=245.44s)]
*  And this is not just their refusal to prioritize a ceasefire and a return of the hostages. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=250.84s)]
*  Also many see some of the extremist measures they're taking on the West Bank, where they're [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=257.88s)]
*  pushing Palestinians off their lands, allowing extremist settlers to assault Palestinians [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=264.1s)]
*  with relative impunity. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=270.8s)]
*  All of this is just going to add fuel to the fire. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=273.08s)]
*  You have a political antenna, a policy antenna. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  I've been listening to Vice President Harris this week speak about Israel and what's going [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=279.32s)]
*  on with the war with Hamas. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=283.21999999999997s)]
*  You've been listening as well. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=285.64s)]
*  Do you believe there is any daylight between her position and articulation of the policy [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=287.2s)]
*  on Israel versus President Biden's? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=293.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=297.28s)]
*  What I think about Vice President Harris's approach here is that all the elements of [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  President Biden's approach are there. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=305.08s)]
*  She supports them. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=308.28s)]
*  She's been part of that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=309.28s)]
*  So Israel's right to self-defense, the fact that how the war is conducted matters. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=310.28s)]
*  Hamas can have no control or governance after this war, no more October 7th. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=315.88s)]
*  But also, very importantly, that the Palestinian Authority has to be the nucleus of governance [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=322.44s)]
*  in a post-war Gaza. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=329.12s)]
*  They have lots of flaws. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=331.74s)]
*  They need lots of help to reform. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=333.24s)]
*  They also need resources. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  And very importantly, and you mentioned this with Congressman McCaul, a path, although [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  he left out this part, a path to a two-state solution to assure that the great majority [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=343.12s)]
*  of the Palestinian people who have nothing to do with Hamas can have some light at the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  end of the tunnel. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=354.76000000000005s)]
*  We need equal security, equal dignity, equal rights of self-determination for Israelis [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=355.76000000000005s)]
*  and Palestinians alike. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=361.48s)]
*  And the president has coupled that with what you did talk about, which was a normalization [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=362.98s)]
*  agreement with Saudi Arabia, which would be very good for the security interests of Israel. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  And she, of course, will remain President Biden's vice president for the rest of the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=371.04s)]
*  term. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=375.12s)]
*  But she's also now the presumptive Democratic nominee. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=376.12s)]
*  100 days between now and the election, would you counsel her in any way to separate or [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=378.48s)]
*  differentiate herself or at least define herself on the Israel issue on her own terms quickly [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=384.44s)]
*  or just to keep going along as is? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=390.64000000000004s)]
*  Well, so I believe the elements of her policy are the same. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=393.04s)]
*  But the question is how we succeed in achieving the elements of the policy. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=398.52000000000004s)]
*  I have been critical of the Biden administration at times for not using all the levers of influence [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=403.52s)]
*  we have to achieve President Biden's stated goals, including what a post-war Gaza looks [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=410.32s)]
*  like. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=416.11999999999995s)]
*  So I was pleased that after her meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu, the vice president [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=417.11999999999995s)]
*  made a statement, a public statement, not a written statement, and she did it with clarity. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=421.11999999999995s)]
*  Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, we appreciate you coming by Face the Nation. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiPZs3X18&t=426.76s)]
