# State Department holds briefing as Israel weighs Hamas hostage deal | full video
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk)
*  That was directed to me, but I don't know. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=0.0s)]
*  I appreciate you being here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=3.04s)]
*  I appreciate everyone being here, full room, right before the holiday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=4.04s)]
*  So. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Oh, so it was just a tease? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  You didn't have anything to say? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  I'm here for your questions. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Well, tell us what the latest – your latest understanding is of the – this alleged deal. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  With respect to hostages, so what I will say is that we are very close to an agreement. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=25.32s)]
*  But we are not there yet. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=30.08s)]
*  As you have heard us say a number of times over the course of the past few weeks, nothing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=31.56s)]
*  is final until everything is final. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=35.56s)]
*  And at this point, everything is not yet final, but we are close. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=38.2s)]
*  The Israeli cabinet is meeting to discuss this matter right now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=43.48s)]
*  We are in close conversation with them, as we are with the government of Qatar, who has [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=46.8s)]
*  been helping facilitate discussions for the – since the early days of the crisis. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=50.56s)]
*  We are hopeful to have some good news for the hostages and their families. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=55.54s)]
*  We are hopeful we can start bringing some of them home. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  But as I said at the outset, we are not quite there yet. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=61.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=63.72s)]
*  Well, so when you made reference to the Israeli cabinet meeting right now, is that the last [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=64.72s)]
*  thing that needs to be done? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=73.56s)]
*  I really don't want to get into the underlying details. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, the Israeli government discussing and coming to some sort of resolution is one [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=79.0s)]
*  part of this. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  There are others. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  I don't want to get into the full details. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  I will say that, of course, the implementation and execution of an agreement, should one [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  be reached, requires the cooperation of Hamas, a terrorist organization. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=93.88s)]
*  So it's why we're always hesitant to say too much about what will happen before it [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=98.08s)]
*  has happened. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  But we are close to an agreement and hopeful one can be reached. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  Jen. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=109.4s)]
*  Is your understanding that the first tranche of hostages to be released would include Americans? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=110.4s)]
*  I just can't get into any type of details about what an agreement would look like, including [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=114.19999999999999s)]
*  who would be released if such an agreement was finalized. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  And have you received any updates on their conditions, whereabouts, if they're being [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  held together, if they are all in fact being held by Hamas? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=125.8s)]
*  Again, I can't get into too much into the underlying details. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=129.48s)]
*  It has always been our assessment that Hamas may not have control of all of these hostages. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=134.04s)]
*  But beyond that, I just don't want to speak to any specific details. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=139.64s)]
*  Barbara. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=144.0s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=145.0s)]
*  Sorry, Michelle. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=146.0s)]
*  Is it your understanding that if and when a deal is reached, that would then trigger [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=147.0s)]
*  more aid being able to get into Gaza, as the Secretary had suggested would happen? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=150.28s)]
*  Let me say a couple things about that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=156.68s)]
*  One, it has always been the position of the United States that we do not need a hostage [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=158.28s)]
*  deal to get more aid in, that more fuel, more food, more water, more medicine should not [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=162.96s)]
*  be contingent on a hostage agreement being reached. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=170.4s)]
*  We thought that the delivery of humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people was [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=173.84s)]
*  important in its own right. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=177.12s)]
*  And that's why the Secretary has been pushing for it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=178.56s)]
*  It's why the President has been pushing for it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  It's what our Ambassador David Satterfield, or special envoy, I should say, Ambassador [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  David Satterfield, has been working to implement on the ground. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  That said, it has been clear that for some time that an agreement on hostages would release [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=189.44000000000003s)]
*  or would unlock the potential for delivery of more humanitarian assistance. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=197.84s)]
*  So we're hopeful that that would take place. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=201.28000000000003s)]
*  But again, it has always been our position that the two don't need to be linked, that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=202.88s)]
*  humanitarian assistance should be delivered as quickly as possible for the benefit of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  the Palestinian people. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=210.0s)]
*  But the Israelis seem to have linked it, it seems. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=211.0s)]
*  It does seem to – the way I would say it is it does appear that any kind of hostage [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=213.24s)]
*  agreement, should we reach one, would unlock more humanitarian assistance flowing in. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=218.2s)]
*  Barbara. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=222.04s)]
*  Actually, that was similar to my question, but on the understanding that that is what [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=223.04s)]
*  you're hoping for, have you made extra preparations? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=229.32s)]
*  I mean, are you poised to move quickly to get more aid in? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=232.6s)]
*  Like, what's the activity around that? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=237.96s)]
*  We have been working to – not just related to any hostage arrangement, we have been working [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  independent of that to facilitate the delivery of more humanitarian assistance in. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  And so you have seen USAID fly more humanitarian assistance into Egypt to have it prepositioned [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=250.16s)]
*  so it could go into Gaza. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=255.6s)]
*  Some of that aid has started to move. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=257.4s)]
*  We've been working with other international donors to facilitate the delivery of aid to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=258.64s)]
*  Egypt to go in through Ra'afah. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=262.56s)]
*  And then, of course, there's a screening process that has been a bit of an impediment [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=263.56s)]
*  to the fast delivery of aid. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=267.76s)]
*  And we have been working with the government of Israel, with the government of Egypt, on [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=270.4s)]
*  all of these matters to try to increase the flow of humanitarian assistance. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=273.44s)]
*  You saw a breakthrough last week, an initial breakthrough, when we saw an agreement to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  deliver fuel in, which, of course, is important to ensure that water can be desalinated. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=281.79999999999995s)]
*  It's important to ensure that there's electricity for hospitals. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  It's important to ensure that the implementers, the organizations that actually deliver the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=290.44s)]
*  humanitarian assistance inside Gaza, once it goes through Ra'afah into Gaza, that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=295.56s)]
*  they can deliver it to the people who need it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=299.88s)]
*  So we have been pushing all those things independent of any potential hostage arrangement, and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=302.32s)]
*  we'll continue to do so. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=307.52s)]
*  Just to follow up, so you mentioned the issue about the screening and trying to get more [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=308.52s)]
*  facilities or people in place to do more screening, which would then help more aid. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  If there is a humanitarian – long humanitarian pause in exchange for hostages, although you're [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=318.12s)]
*  not linking aid to hostages, but whatever – if there is a time period, does that mean [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=327.64s)]
*  you wouldn't necessarily get a lot more aid in if you're still dealing with these [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=332.32s)]
*  issues like screening and so on? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=335.8s)]
*  How much of a – how much do you think it could boost aid if there was four ways of [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=337.36s)]
*  it? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=342.36s)]
*  I think we're getting into the realm I'm not comfortable. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=343.36s)]
*  I'll talk a little bit about what we have done and what we're trying to do, but when [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=346.24s)]
*  we start getting too far into what could happen as a potential result of a deal that has not [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=349.56s)]
*  yet been reached, I think I'm going to decline to comment in too much detail. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=354.52000000000004s)]
*  Just one last question. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=358.44s)]
*  The Israelis beginning their southern offensive, and you've talked about wanting to make [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=361.48s)]
*  sure there's better arrangements in place for protection of civilians. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=367.12s)]
*  Have you been asking them to delay their southern offensive until that's ready? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=373.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, they've already kind of started anyway, but where are things at? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=377.76000000000005s)]
*  So I won't get into too much detail about the private conversations that happened between [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  our two governments, but we have made clear to them, as we have made clear publicly, that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=385.36s)]
*  we think they should not commence with further activities in the south until they have taken [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=390.12s)]
*  the proper steps to account for the humanitarian needs there. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  There are a number, several hundred thousand people who have moved from the north to the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=399.08s)]
*  south before any military offensive begins there. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=402.32s)]
*  We would want to ensure that those people are properly protected. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  Said, go ahead. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=410.64s)]
*  I just want to follow up on a couple of things that Barbara raised, but before that I want [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=411.64s)]
*  to state for the record that the poet, Mos'ab Abu Toha, whom I raised yesterday, he was [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  actually released today by the Israelis, and I like to think that you guys had something [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=421.76s)]
*  and he will be on his way to Egypt so he can come back to the United States with his family. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=427.24s)]
*  On the issue of the deal itself, we're talking about – [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=433.2s)]
*  The issue of what itself? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  The potential deal. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, the deal, the deal, yeah. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  The potential deal that could or may not happen. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  Is it your understanding that there is a split in the Israeli cabinet as to who may agree [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=446.2s)]
*  or disagree, and will that hold the going forward with the deal? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=453.04s)]
*  I'm just not going to discuss internal Israeli political matters. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=457.96s)]
*  Right, but let's say – I mean, if the war cabinet agrees and the larger cabinet [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=461.96s)]
*  does not agree or the Supreme Court and so on, then we're back to square one. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=467.44s)]
*  Are you urging the Israelis to go forward with the deal? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=470.92s)]
*  I'm not going to discuss our private conversations with the Israeli government, but we have been [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=474.64s)]
*  attempting to reach an agreement to secure the release of hostages for some time, and [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=478.8s)]
*  I'll leave it at that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=483.40000000000003s)]
*  Let me just ask you on something that you always state, that you want the Israelis to [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  abide by the laws of war. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=490.8s)]
*  You want to minimize civilian casualties among Palestinians and so on. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=493.32000000000005s)]
*  Yesterday or the day before was Children's World Day or whatever. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=497.52000000000004s)]
*  Fifty-five hundred Palestinian children have died thus far. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=504.08000000000004s)]
*  Do you think the Israelis are abiding by the laws of war? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=507.72s)]
*  So I will say that it is a tragedy how many people have died in Gaza. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=510.48s)]
*  It's a tragedy how many children have died, especially. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=517.0s)]
*  As the Secretary has said, it is our belief that far too many Palestinian civilians have [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=521.32s)]
*  been killed as a result of this conflict. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=526.1600000000001s)]
*  We continue to engage with the government of Israel about steps we believe they should [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=529.84s)]
*  take to minimize civilian casualties. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=534.5600000000001s)]
*  It is an ongoing conversation between our two governments, and we continue to engage [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=536.8399999999999s)]
*  with them on every possible measure they can take to ensure that civilians are not in harm's [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=541.8s)]
*  way as they conduct legitimate military operations. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=547.92s)]
*  And I do want to remind everyone again that the reason why this is so difficult, difficult [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  even in most conflicts, is because Hamas embeds itself inside civilian targets. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=557.52s)]
*  And so Israel faces this difficult situation where there are legitimate military targets, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=564.6s)]
*  terrorists who launch an attack against the Israeli public and who have said they want [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=571.44s)]
*  to continue launching terrorist attacks against the Israeli public and in fact continue to [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=574.6800000000001s)]
*  launch rockets even in the past few days against the Israeli public. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=578.48s)]
*  And Israel has a right and obligation to take military action to try to bring those terrorists [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=581.96s)]
*  to justice, but their burden is in no way lessened to minimize civilian harm. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=586.6800000000001s)]
*  And so that is what we continue to emphasize to them in all of our conversations with them, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=591.36s)]
*  including concrete steps about how they can do that. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=595.0799999999999s)]
*  And on that very point now, the Israelis seem to be obsessed with the Palestinian hospitals. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=597.9599999999999s)]
*  I wonder if you've seen the interview done on CNN with the former Israeli Prime Minister [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=603.0799999999999s)]
*  Yehud Barak who acknowledged that it was actually Israel that built these basements or tunnels [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=609.52s)]
*  and so on. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=616.28s)]
*  Have you seen that? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=617.28s)]
*  I saw a report of the interview. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=618.28s)]
*  I haven't seen the full interview and I don't have any independent assessment about that. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=619.28s)]
*  I would say regardless of where, what particular tunnel he might be speaking to or what's [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=623.1999999999999s)]
*  it, if there are Hamas, the issue of Hamas embedding itself under a hospital would be [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=629.0799999999999s)]
*  a different matter. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=635.04s)]
*  Obviously, I mean, they really showed no proof, but he was saying, what he was suggesting, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=636.04s)]
*  that these whatever caverns or whatever you want to call them underneath the hospital, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=641.04s)]
*  they actually were there for utilitarian purposes. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=646.0s)]
*  So what I will say about that is, number one, we have, we've assessed, but it's public [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=648.76s)]
*  knowledge at this point, shown over many years that Hamas has also built its own tunnels, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=657.52s)]
*  regardless of what, regardless of that. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=663.24s)]
*  Number two, whatever infrastructure exists at a hospital, under a hospital, no matter [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=665.56s)]
*  who put it there, terrorists should not be using that infrastructure to embed themselves [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=670.8s)]
*  underneath a civilian target, underneath a civilian hospital, underneath a hospital [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=675.88s)]
*  that is supposed to exist for the care of civilians and making that, using that facility [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=681.12s)]
*  as a human shield. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=687.44s)]
*  So it is, I think, a separate issue than who might have built whatever room it is the former [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=688.44s)]
*  prime minister was referring to. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=692.64s)]
*  Humira. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=694.2s)]
*  Matt, just to follow up on a couple of things from colleagues' questions. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=695.2s)]
*  So this might be a little bit down the line, but is there at all an understanding in these [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=700.64s)]
*  hostage negotiations for what comes next after this deal? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=707.12s)]
*  And I'm asking because there are 240 people who are taken hostage by Hamas. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=711.64s)]
*  So while Israel, Hamas, Qatar, and you were in – somehow in these conversations about [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=718.96s)]
*  this number of people, was there any understanding for what happens with the rest of the people? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=727.6s)]
*  So I do appreciate the question, but if I'm going to decline to comment on an arrangement [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=736.24s)]
*  that has not yet been finalized, not yet been reached, I certainly don't think I can comment [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=742.16s)]
*  on what might come next after this arrangement. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=747.3199999999999s)]
*  I would just say, reiterate that, again, we're close to a deal. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=752.4s)]
*  We don't have one yet. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=757.2s)]
*  I can't talk about what might be in a potential deal, let alone what might come in its aftermath. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=758.84s)]
*  But surely you're talking for everybody. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=763.96s)]
*  It is our – it has been our goal from the beginning to secure the release of every single hostage. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=766.44s)]
*  The United States is focused on American citizens, of course, but we're focused on all the hostages. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=771.12s)]
*  We want to see all the hostages released. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=775.76s)]
*  We don't think any of them should be held. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=777.28s)]
*  That has been the goal of our negotiations from the outset, but I can't get into what [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=779.6s)]
*  any steps might look like. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=785.04s)]
*  And just to push you a little bit more on Barbara's question about possible Israeli [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=786.04s)]
*  offensive in the South, John Feiner also talked about this as well. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=790.72s)]
*  But what is the very latest in the sense that – are you getting a timeline from them on [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=795.88s)]
*  when they are planning to start this? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=802.76s)]
*  And are you telling them specifically, here are the things, here are the objectives, here [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=807.36s)]
*  are the safe zones you have to create, or whatever you think appropriate to call them [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=812.8s)]
*  before you start this? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=817.08s)]
*  And without these, you should not be starting this. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=818.4s)]
*  Is it that clear cut? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=820.64s)]
*  So we are having fairly detailed conversations with them about steps that they could take [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=822.2s)]
*  to protect civilians and steps that they could take to increase humanitarian access, increase [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=827.3199999999999s)]
*  humanitarian protections, especially in the South. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=832.32s)]
*  I don't want to get into the details of those conversations. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=834.7600000000001s)]
*  Obviously, the Israeli government makes its own decisions about its military campaigns. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=837.5200000000001s)]
*  The conversations that we have been having with them are on steps that they can take [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=841.84s)]
*  as they look to the South to increase protections for civilians, especially considering that [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=846.0s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of civilians, after being told to move by the Israeli government, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=851.72s)]
*  move from the north to the south, we think it's important that those civilians now [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=856.0400000000001s)]
*  have a way to put themselves out of harm's way. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=859.72s)]
*  And in terms of the protections for civilians, is it United States government's proposal, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=862.72s)]
*  and does it include ICRC or UN for the creation of those safe zones? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=868.92s)]
*  Like whose proposal is it and what does it look like? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=876.0799999999999s)]
*  So we have been in conversation not just with the government of Israel, but with a range [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=878.52s)]
*  of humanitarian organizations, including the United Nations, about how exactly civilian [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=882.62s)]
*  protections could be implemented, how they can best be implemented. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=888.52s)]
*  But I think it's best that while those conversations are ongoing, I keep the details of them confidential. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=891.56s)]
*  Do you have like a target in mind? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=895.52s)]
*  Like we're looking to conclude those conversations and have some sort of a rough plan by the [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=898.16s)]
*  end of the week, soon? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=903.36s)]
*  I just wouldn't want to put a time limit on it. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=904.36s)]
*  One more. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=907.36s)]
*  There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy between U.S. and UN on the opening of Karam Shalom. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=908.36s)]
*  I've read the transcript from yesterday. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=914.76s)]
*  You guys don't seem to be focusing on trying to get that one open. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=918.44s)]
*  Do you think RAFA has the capacity to process more aid? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=921.6800000000001s)]
*  But UN Martin Griffiths seems to disagree a little bit, and they are imploring Israel [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=927.5200000000001s)]
*  to allow humanitarian aid via Karam Shalom. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=934.7600000000001s)]
*  Why is it a discrepancy? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=938.24s)]
*  So there may be a little bit of apples and oranges here. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=939.24s)]
*  In terms of addressing your question, we don't think that there is a problem with the ability [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=942.72s)]
*  for RAFA to handle more traffic in terms of the number of trucks that can just physically [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=949.96s)]
*  go through it carrying humanitarian. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=953.8000000000001s)]
*  RAFA is big enough to handle that. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=955.36s)]
*  It's big enough to allow the delivery of a massive amount of humanitarian assistance. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=956.6800000000001s)]
*  There has been an issue with screening. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=960.96s)]
*  I think Jen was alluding to it in her question earlier. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=962.76s)]
*  And we have been in conversation with the government of Israel about additional ways [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=966.72s)]
*  to get additional screening for trucks that would then go in through RAFA. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=969.72s)]
*  But no, I'm coming. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=973.12s)]
*  The government of Israel has very real concerns about security at Karam Shalom. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=976.72s)]
*  And you can understand why. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=980.84s)]
*  One side of that border is obviously Gaza, in areas of Gaza that are still controlled [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=982.62s)]
*  by Hamas, that are not controlled by the government of Israel. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=988.4399999999999s)]
*  We continue to have conversations with Israel about the best way to increase the amount [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=992.28s)]
*  of screening so trucks can get screened and then get in through RAFA. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=996.36s)]
*  But they do have very real concerns about opening Karam Shalom, and that's why you've [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=999.6800000000001s)]
*  seen them not take that step as of yet. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1003.6800000000001s)]
*  Final thing, because Griffiths is actually giving a percentage saying Karam Shalom Crossing [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1005.16s)]
*  used to – was used to carry more than 60 percent of the truckloads going into Gaza [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1009.76s)]
*  before the conflict. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1013.72s)]
*  But I understand and I'm aware of the sort of screening-related backlog. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1015.0s)]
*  U.S. is not pursuing this actively with the Israelis, is what I'm understanding from [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1020.08s)]
*  you. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1026.64s)]
*  The opening of that. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1027.64s)]
*  What – the point I'm making is that we think RAFA is sufficient for the delivery [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1028.64s)]
*  of humanitarian assistance. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1032.48s)]
*  That is a separate question from screening. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1033.8s)]
*  We want to try to get screening back online and open, but we think RAFA gate at this point [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1035.4s)]
*  is the appropriate way to get assistance in. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1040.84s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1042.24s)]
*  Thank you, Matt. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1043.24s)]
*  Correspondent Farah Ammar, she was colleague as well, and cameraman Rabih Ammar, you were [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1044.24s)]
*  killed by an Israeli attack south of Lebanon. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1048.88s)]
*  There was direct attack because it was carried by a drone. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1052.92s)]
*  And drone, you know, you have a camera, you can see who's on the ground. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1055.8000000000002s)]
*  They were under a tree waiting for her turn to go on live on TV. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1059.28s)]
*  While there was a comment from the manager of the Mayadeen channel, who happened to be [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1064.52s)]
*  their boss, that Israeli government decision this month to block access to channel's [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1070.76s)]
*  website and this attack targeted them. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1075.4s)]
*  my colleague, Nakhli Adami, could have killed as well. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1079.2s)]
*  The missile passed by him and there was a convoy of different stations, Al Jazeera, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1082.44s)]
*  Al Arabiya, all kinds of stations, Washington Post, and Beirut. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1087.32s)]
*  They were checking some of the areas, a tour by the UN. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1090.6000000000001s)]
*  So how Israel is obeying the rule of law if it's attacking directly journalists to punish [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1095.44s)]
*  them or silence them? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1101.3600000000001s)]
*  And no offense. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1103.52s)]
*  Israel has an extension, a huge history of killing civilians directly. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1105.64s)]
*  So again, I can never, I'm never in a position from here to speak to any particular strike [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1110.4s)]
*  or any particular military action when the entire facts are not known to me or not known [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1115.88s)]
*  to the U.S. government, including what information the governor of Israel had, what might have [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1120.76s)]
*  gone into a decision, whether there was a mistake or not. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1124.72s)]
*  It's impossible for me to speak to the merits of any individual strike. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1127.48s)]
*  That has been true not just with respect to this one, but with respect to others. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1130.44s)]
*  I will say that we are concerned by the reports that civilians, including two journalists, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1134.56s)]
*  were killed in Lebanon. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1139.16s)]
*  Our thoughts are with the loved ones of those killed and all these Lebanese people. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1141.0s)]
*  If you were here yesterday, you heard me speak to our belief in the importance that journalists [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1146.04s)]
*  play in conflict zones. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1149.76s)]
*  Journalists are fundamental to a free society. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1151.96s)]
*  We stand with the journalists around the world who do critical work that we rely on every [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1154.48s)]
*  day. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1158.92s)]
*  We rely on the reports of journalists here in the United States government. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1159.92s)]
*  We know people all around the world do, and they do that in some of the most dangerous [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1161.88s)]
*  conditions imaginable. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1166.24s)]
*  I will also say that we are concerned over the escalation of violence along the blue [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1167.92s)]
*  line. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1171.92s)]
*  We have made clear we don't want to see the conflict in Gaza spread to Lebanon. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1172.92s)]
*  That has been one of our top priorities and one of the top objectives we've tried to [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1176.3600000000001s)]
*  achieve since the outset of this conflict. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1180.1200000000001s)]
*  Restoring calm among the blue line is of the utmost importance to us, and it should be [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1183.2s)]
*  a top priority for both Israel and Lebanon. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1187.68s)]
*  There was also an attack on a church yesterday. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1190.12s)]
*  And I'm not sure if you know the nature of south of Lebanon. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1192.68s)]
*  Christian villages don't have any existence of Hezbollah. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1196.12s)]
*  So we can say, like, Hamas, they were attacking or throwing missiles next to a hospital or [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1199.1599999999999s)]
*  a mosque. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1204.52s)]
*  In Lebanon, Christian villages don't have any presence of Hezbollah. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1205.52s)]
*  What was the target inside that church? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1210.56s)]
*  Who was holding accountability? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1212.28s)]
*  I know you're putting so much pressure on Israeli government. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1213.28s)]
*  No, I understand. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1216.04s)]
*  But when you asked me that type of question, it was not an action carried out by the United [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1217.04s)]
*  States government. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1220.48s)]
*  It's not a question I can answer, and I'm not able to offer an assessment about an individual [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1221.48s)]
*  strike. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1224.6000000000001s)]
*  You are supplying Israel over $14 billion of military aid. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1225.6000000000001s)]
*  But when it comes to a specific strike where it's not an action that's taken by the United [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1229.3600000000001s)]
*  States government and I don't have all the available information, it's not something [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1233.64s)]
*  I can offer an assessment on. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1236.8s)]
*  Why the post – last question. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1237.8s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1238.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1239.8s)]
*  Why the feeling in the Middle East that anything happened with – okay, everybody's – as [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1240.8s)]
*  a human, as any person will condemn any action against humans, what happened October 7th. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1245.64s)]
*  Why there is a feeling in the Middle East, in every country now, that the U.S., whatever [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1251.1200000000001s)]
*  happens in Israel, it's a big deal, but the life of Palestinians or other people, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1255.3600000000001s)]
*  it's no deal. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1259.96s)]
*  It's nothing. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1260.96s)]
*  I'm telling you what, what's the feeling in that? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1261.96s)]
*  When you can do it, it's a real deal, and you can have the same feeling. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1262.96s)]
*  Let me just answer the question. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1265.0s)]
*  I think the Secretary has been very clear about this exact question, that far too many [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1266.2800000000002s)]
*  Palestinians have been killed. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1269.68s)]
*  He's spoken to this directly. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1271.4s)]
*  He's spoken to how, as a father, when he sees, especially the bodies of deceased children, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1273.36s)]
*  how it affects him. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1279.9199999999998s)]
*  And I can tell you that's true for everyone inside the United States government. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1280.9199999999998s)]
*  And it is precisely why we do engage with the Israeli government to impress upon them [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1284.56s)]
*  the need to take all possible steps to minimize civilian harm. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1289.1599999999999s)]
*  So I hear this sometimes, and I can tell you, these are conversations that we have at the [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1294.68s)]
*  highest levels of our government. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1298.48s)]
*  Sometimes very intense conversations about steps that we believe Israel should take, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1301.1599999999999s)]
*  as well as the steps that we believe they should take to keep civilians out of harm's [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1304.96s)]
*  way, to help civilians move to places where they'll be safe from harm so they won't [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1309.1599999999999s)]
*  be injured from this ongoing military conflict, as well as the steps that we think are important [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1312.72s)]
*  that we have pushed for and in many cases secured to get humanitarian assistance in [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1317.28s)]
*  to the Palestinian people. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1322.52s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1323.52s)]
*  I want to go back to Gaza and the ongoing – the reports of ongoing and circulation [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1324.52s)]
*  of the Indonesian hospital in north – Indonesian hospital in north in Gaza, and there's also [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1330.04s)]
*  reports of some killed and injured during some Israeli military attack on the hospital. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1336.08s)]
*  What is the reason of attacking this hospital in your perspective? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1342.92s)]
*  Again, so I would say I'm not able to assess the merits, the individual facts or circumstances [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1347.28s)]
*  surrounding any individual strike. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1355.68s)]
*  I think all of you that have covered wars in the past know about conflicting information [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1357.6399999999999s)]
*  that emerges and accounts that change over time. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1362.32s)]
*  It's difficult for anyone to make an assessment about what happened and the reason for it [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1365.36s)]
*  happened and certainly we don't have all the facts – or I don't have all the facts [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1370.04s)]
*  here at this podium to speak to them. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1372.9599999999998s)]
*  I will say as a principal, we do not want to see hospitals struck from the air. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1374.3999999999999s)]
*  We want to see hospitals protected. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1379.1999999999998s)]
*  Hospitals provide critical services to the civilian population in Gaza and we want to [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1381.28s)]
*  see the government of Israel take steps to minimize harm to civilians, and of course [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1386.32s)]
*  that includes at hospitals where civilians are seeking much needed medical care. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1390.48s)]
*  But I'm not talking about the merit from the Israeli point of view. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1394.76s)]
*  I mean, for that, Al-Shifa, for example, you had an assessment that Al-Shifa is used by [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1399.16s)]
*  Hamas either as a headquarter or a command center. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1403.76s)]
*  Do you have any assessment that Hamas is using the Indonesian hospital as a command center? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1407.68s)]
*  I'm not going to speak to intelligence assessments. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1413.44s)]
*  Aside from the very limited information that we have already downgraded and made public, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1416.48s)]
*  we do see, unfortunately, that Hamas uses not just hospitals but mosques and schools [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1422.76s)]
*  and other places of civilian infrastructure as places where they can embed their fighters, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1427.32s)]
*  as places that they can use to launch attacks, and places where they can use civilians as [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1433.24s)]
*  human shields. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1437.76s)]
*  So, as I said a minute ago and answered another question, it puts the Israeli government in [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1438.76s)]
*  a very difficult position where they are trying to defeat legitimate military or try to accomplish [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1441.92s)]
*  legitimate military objectives, but sometimes when the terrorists they are trying to go [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1448.1200000000001s)]
*  after have hidden themselves in hospitals and schools and mosques. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1452.76s)]
*  So it is a difficult problem, but it doesn't lessen their responsibility, which is why [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1456.72s)]
*  we continue to engage in these conversations with them about taking every possible step [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1460.52s)]
*  they can to minimize civilian harm. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1464.28s)]
*  I will say with respect to Al-Shifa, we were very clear. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1466.76s)]
*  We did not want to see Al-Shifa struck from the air. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1469.8000000000002s)]
*  We did not want to see fighting going on inside the hospital. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1471.8s)]
*  We wanted to see civilians protected. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1474.24s)]
*  And I think when Israel did launch their military operation at Al-Shifa, you saw them do it [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1476.6s)]
*  in a much more careful way where they went into the hospital in a way where they were [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1485.12s)]
*  trying to protect patients and where they were trying to evacuate patients. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1488.56s)]
*  Before they went in, they offered to help facilitate or to allow third-party relief [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1494.42s)]
*  organizations to facilitate the evacuation of that hospital. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1499.1399999999999s)]
*  Hamas said no. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1502.3s)]
*  Hamas wouldn't allow it. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1503.3s)]
*  So there is always more that Israel can do to take steps to minimize civilian harm, and [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1504.9399999999998s)]
*  we will continue to encourage them to do that. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1509.3799999999999s)]
*  But again, as long as Hamas continues to embed itself inside the civilian population, we [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1513.1s)]
*  are going to see this difficult challenge over and over again. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1519.1399999999999s)]
*  Michel. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1523.02s)]
*  Will the Secretary receive the Arab ministerial delegation that visited China? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1524.7s)]
*  And how do you view their visit to China first? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1530.02s)]
*  I don't have any scheduling announcements to make, but certainly a number of the ministers [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1534.18s)]
*  who made that trip to China are people who he's met with repeatedly in the past few [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1539.7s)]
*  weeks and people he's had conversations with by phone repeatedly. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1543.7s)]
*  So we will continue to engage with a number of those individuals, whether it be here, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1547.46s)]
*  whether it be in the region. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1551.98s)]
*  I think you can anticipate that the Secretary is not done traveling to the region, and of [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1553.7s)]
*  course we – I will mention that we met with the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, the [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1557.5400000000002s)]
*  foreign minister of Egypt, both of whom were part of this delegation in New York last month. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1562.5800000000002s)]
*  So we will continue to meet with them. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1566.8200000000002s)]
*  Whether it's here or there, I don't have an announcement to make at this time. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1568.5800000000002s)]
*  The Saudi conference has asked all the countries who are providing Israel with arms to stop [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1570.78s)]
*  providing them with the – with ammunition and arms. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1578.0600000000002s)]
*  Is the U.S. ready to do so? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1581.6599999999999s)]
*  No, that is not a step we're ready to take. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1583.98s)]
*  In fact, we have a supplemental request pending before Congress that we hope Congress will [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1586.3799999999999s)]
*  act on expeditiously, which provides additional assistance to Israel as well as additional [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1591.34s)]
*  assistance to Ukraine. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1597.4199999999998s)]
*  And finally, do you have any update on the talks and discussions that you are doing with [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1599.4199999999998s)]
*  partners and allies regarding the ship that Houthi has seized? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1606.1s)]
*  No, I do not. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1611.58s)]
*  It's a – continues to be an ongoing matter of diplomatic discussion. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1613.34s)]
*  Alex, go ahead. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1617.34s)]
*  Thank you, Matt. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1618.3799999999999s)]
*  A couple of things. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1619.18s)]
*  But before that, a deal, a potential deal. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1620.1399999999999s)]
*  I am saying you don't want to get into details about the potential deal. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1621.66s)]
*  About what? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1624.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1624.78s)]
*  How confident are you that there will be well-established international mechanisms to ensure that all [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1625.34s)]
*  the sides are holding promises? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1629.58s)]
*  I'm not going to talk at all about any of the details of a potential deal, which that [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1631.66s)]
*  obviously would be when one has not yet been reached. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1636.86s)]
*  But what is your level of concern that potentially might be jeopardized by other actors like [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1640.22s)]
*  Iran, Russia? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1646.38s)]
*  Again, let's – I know, but like any questions about a potential deal, maybe let's wait [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1646.94s)]
*  until we actually have a deal and then we can talk about it. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1652.14s)]
*  But when it's still a potential deal, I think I'll decline to comment. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1654.7s)]
*  It might also be that it's concerned that Wagner is potentially preparing to send military [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1657.98s)]
*  equipment to Hezbollah or Iran. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1664.46s)]
*  First of all, what do you know and what can you do to prevent this from happening? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1666.3799999999999s)]
*  And also, in terms of deal, how much do you think this might jeopardize? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1671.8999999999999s)]
*  So it is a concern that we have. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1677.18s)]
*  The White House spoke to this earlier today. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1679.5s)]
*  I don't have any kind of detail to add to that. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1680.78s)]
*  But to the question, third time you've tried to ask me, I'm just not going to comment [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1683.26s)]
*  at all on a potential deal and what implication anything might have or might not have on it. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1686.78s)]
*  As for Wagner itself, as you know, this is international – the U.S. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1692.3s)]
*  recognizes it as an international criminal organization. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1695.58s)]
*  Where do you draw the line, red line, in terms of switching from international criminal [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1697.74s)]
*  organization to recognizing it as an international terrorist organization? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1702.22s)]
*  So this is a conversation that you and I have had many times. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1706.1399999999999s)]
*  I don't have a different answer for you than I have had – than I've had the previous – [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1708.9399999999998s)]
*  a new angle, it's the same question. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1712.54s)]
*  I don't have the different answer the previous seven or eight times I've answered, which [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1714.06s)]
*  is we have taken a number of steps to hold Wagner accountable, including the designated [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1718.22s)]
*  you mentioned, including multiple sanctions for its activities in Ukraine, its activities [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1723.34s)]
*  in Africa, and we will continue to do so. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1727.82s)]
*  Please come back to Ukraine as a pranatik. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1730.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1731.98s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1732.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1733.02s)]
*  I just wanted to follow up on the exchange in this room yesterday about the feature of Gaza. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1733.82s)]
*  You said there may need to be some transition period in Gaza. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1738.54s)]
*  Can you clarify what do you mean by a transition period? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1744.3s)]
*  And who will govern Gaza during this transition period? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1747.74s)]
*  Again, we're getting a little – this is a little cart before the horse, as some of [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1752.3s)]
*  the questions about hostages have been. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1758.22s)]
*  What I meant with respect to transition – a transition period is something the Secretary [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1760.86s)]
*  has spoken to. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1764.7s)]
*  First, let me back up and say that we have outlined some clear principles that we believe [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1766.46s)]
*  to the future status of Gaza when this conflict is over. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1772.5400000000002s)]
*  We've been through those principles – no reoccupation of Gaza, no control of Gaza by [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1777.8200000000002s)]
*  Hamas, no diminution in the territorial size of Gaza, no siege of Gaza. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1783.1000000000001s)]
*  That said, Israel is conducting a military operation. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1791.18s)]
*  At some point, that military operation will end. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1794.94s)]
*  There will have to be a transition period before the next status emerges. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1797.98s)]
*  Before – we've talked about what we want to see as the Palestinian Authority ultimately [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1807.5800000000002s)]
*  governing both Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1814.14s)]
*  There has to be some security force in place for a transition period. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1817.66s)]
*  You can't just see the Israeli government complete its security operations and then [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1821.26s)]
*  walk out and leave Gaza in a vacuum, a security and political vacuum immediately. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1826.86s)]
*  There will have to be some transition period. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1830.78s)]
*  What that transition period looks like, I think it's too early to say. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1832.9399999999998s)]
*  We're engaged in those conversations with allies and partners right now, and we'll [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1835.6599999999999s)]
*  continue to look for the best solution possible with one of our first principles being that [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1840.78s)]
*  the Palestinian people themselves need to be front and center in deciding the future [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1848.3s)]
*  governments of Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1852.5400000000002s)]
*  But I think as we are in the ongoing military campaign in Gaza, it's a little too early [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1855.5s)]
*  to talk about what those details might look like. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1861.9s)]
*  So you stated the U.S. position, but it seems that the U.S. and Israel have different visions [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1863.9s)]
*  for a post for Gaza. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1871.18s)]
*  Secretary Blinken said Gaza should be unified with the West Bank under the PA, but Netanyahu [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1873.18s)]
*  made it clear during the CNN interview that he would not be handing over Gaza's control [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1883.3400000000001s)]
*  to the PA. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1889.98s)]
*  There are also other issues that it seems that you don't agree on. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1891.42s)]
*  So how will you address this gap between you and the Netanyahu government? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1895.18s)]
*  That is what diplomacy is for. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1900.94s)]
*  We have laid out our principles, and you will see us engage with the government of Israel, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1902.8600000000001s)]
*  as well as other governments in the region, to advance our principles, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1906.6200000000001s)]
*  as well as engage with the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people directly to talk about [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1910.3799999999999s)]
*  what the future of Gaza looks like at the end of this conflict. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1917.6599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1920.1399999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Mark. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1921.1399999999999s)]
*  Going back to the deal, you said that you're close to that deal. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1921.82s)]
*  How close you are, and then do you expect to be announced? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1925.1799999999998s)]
*  I don't even know how to answer that question. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1927.58s)]
*  I think I said we're very close. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1929.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1930.78s)]
*  We're getting a little into the – sorry, go ahead. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1931.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1934.54s)]
*  Qatari government will announce it today. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1935.1799999999998s)]
*  Do you expect it? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1936.78s)]
*  I'm not going to speculate at all about when an announcement can come. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1937.74s)]
*  What's your priority when we are talking about bringing and releasing the hostages? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1941.74s)]
*  Is it elderly or the American people? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1946.3000000000002s)]
*  Again, I don't want to talk to the underlined. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1948.54s)]
*  Ultimately, our goal has been to see the release of all hostages. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1950.8600000000001s)]
*  We think there's no reason that Hamas ought to be holding hostages at all. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1955.5s)]
*  As a reminder, I stand up here and take all these questions about what the [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1959.18s)]
*  government of Israel has done. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1961.66s)]
*  Hamas continues to hold hostages, elderly people, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1962.7s)]
*  children, sick people. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1966.46s)]
*  They all ought to be released immediately. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1968.78s)]
*  Now, what the arrangement might look like, I'm not going to speak to any underlined details. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1971.1s)]
*  How do you try to put some American – [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1975.1s)]
*  I'm just not going to – I'm going to draw the line and not [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1976.62s)]
*  decline to comment on any further details. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1980.78s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1983.5s)]
*  I do appreciate all the questions. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1983.98s)]
*  There's been some creative attempts, but I'm – it's going to decline. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1985.26s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1989.1799999999998s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1989.8999999999999s)]
*  Change of subject? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1991.1s)]
*  Sure. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1991.74s)]
*  Sure. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1992.4s)]
*  U.S. Ambassador in Pakistan Donald Blum announced the aid package of $4 million for [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1994.48s)]
*  Pakistani security forces to bluster Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=1999.44s)]
*  But a group of U.S. lawmakers, in a letter to Secretary Blinken, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2005.44s)]
*  asked Biden administration to suspend all military assistance to Pakistan for [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2009.6s)]
*  human rights violations and for the political crisis. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2014.48s)]
*  So would you provide any details about that aid package and what – how [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2018.32s)]
*  would you respond to that letter of U.S. lawmakers? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2021.6s)]
*  So I wouldn't want to preview how we would respond to the letter here. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2024.08s)]
*  We obviously respond directly to those members of Congress. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2026.8799999999999s)]
*  With respect to the announcement that the ambassador made, we'll be pursuing four new [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2031.2s)]
*  initiatives to support the Balochistan police and their efforts to protect and serve their [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2035.04s)]
*  local communities. We're going to provide $4 million in assistance to expand the [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2039.2s)]
*  force training facility, $2 million to repair or replace 10 flood-damaged police stations, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2043.6000000000001s)]
*  $2 million to construct 10 new police stations that incorporate the same model to improve [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2049.68s)]
*  service to women, girls, and all Pakistanis, and then an additional $250,000 in equipment [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2053.44s)]
*  to protect law enforcement officers in the course of conducting their work. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2058.7200000000003s)]
*  These initiatives build on more than 40 years of partnership between the U.S. mission in [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2062.8s)]
*  Pakistan and the Pakistani government on civilian security and rule of law. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2067.6s)]
*  And from our standpoint, the partnership improves justice institutions and provides [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2071.6s)]
*  law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to protect Pakistan citizens. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2076.64s)]
*  Sir, Pakistani media is reporting that U.S. Ambassador Donald Blum held a meeting with [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2080.56s)]
*  former Prime Minister Imran Khan in Erdogan prison and discussed the political situation. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2085.44s)]
*  Would you deny or confirm that meeting? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2089.8399999999997s)]
*  So I would refer you to the embassy to contact – to comment on any meetings the ambassador [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2092.3199999999997s)]
*  has had, but as we have said a number of times, we do not take position – a position on [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2101.44s)]
*  candidates for political office in Pakistan or any other country. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2106.56s)]
*  So one last question, sir. Pakistan is reporting millions of Afghan refugees, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2109.68s)]
*  but on the request of U.S. government, Pakistan says that it would not deport 25,000 Afghan [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2114.0s)]
*  refugees who are waiting for their American visas. How would you see this decision of Pakistan [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2120.16s)]
*  in current – so – [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2123.84s)]
*  So we are in close and constant communication with the government of Pakistan on the safety [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2124.2400000000002s)]
*  of individuals in the U.S. pipeline. It is our desire to work in good faith with the [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2128.48s)]
*  government of Pakistan to address any concerns that it may have. Our key concern is the safety [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2133.2s)]
*  of the vulnerable and at-risk individuals. We believe it is in both our country's interests to [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2138.4s)]
*  ensure the safe and efficient resettlement of refugees and asylum seekers, and we join [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2142.64s)]
*  all of our partners in urging all countries, including Pakistan, to uphold their respective [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2149.84s)]
*  obligations in the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers, and strongly encourage [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2154.88s)]
*  all of Afghanistan's neighbors to allow entry for Afghans seeking international protection and [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2161.6s)]
*  coordinate with international humanitarian organizations to provide humanitarian assistance. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2167.04s)]
*  Can I have a follow-up? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2171.36s)]
*  Sure. Yeah, go ahead. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2172.7200000000003s)]
*  Could you give us a sense of numbers on how many Americans or Afghans we're talking about that [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2173.84s)]
*  would be in this pipeline? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2181.92s)]
*  I don't have a – I don't have a number at my disposal right now. I'd be happy to follow up [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2183.36s)]
*  and see if we can get it for you. I just don't have it in my fingertips. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2189.2000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much. I will stay in subcontinent. Just to make sure, do you think that the choice [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2192.1600000000003s)]
*  of violence by the nationalist party in Bangladesh is contributing to the undermining the democratic [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2199.1200000000003s)]
*  process in Bangladesh? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2205.36s)]
*  So we want to see a free and peaceful election in Bangladesh. We want to see the elections [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2206.56s)]
*  carried out as – carried out peacefully. That has been our policy, as I've made clear a number [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2211.7599999999998s)]
*  of times from here. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2217.7599999999998s)]
*  Thank you for that. Will you condemn – I repeat, will you condemn the political violence [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2218.4s)]
*  orchestrated by the BNP to the context of human rights that you care about? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2223.2799999999997s)]
*  I think I answered that with my previous answer. Go ahead. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2227.68s)]
*  Thank you very much, Marie. I have a question on Russia and one on the U.S. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2230.48s)]
*  There is a media report that President Biden will not be attending tomorrow's virtual [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2235.2799999999997s)]
*  G20 summit. Who will be representing the U.S. tomorrow? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2241.2799999999997s)]
*  So I will let the White House speak to the President's schedule. I don't have any [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2244.3199999999997s)]
*  update on that. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2248.0s)]
*  Okay. And I have one more question on CTBT. So as you know, Russia has withdrew its [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2248.56s)]
*  ratification of the treaty, and following that, Secretary Blinken said that the U.S. remains [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2255.52s)]
*  committed to achieving the entry into force of the treaty. Can you please clarify, has the State [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2262.16s)]
*  Department done anything over the past two years to advance this goal and to work with the Senate [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2269.2s)]
*  to ratify it? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2275.2s)]
*  Let me take that one back and get you an answer. Go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2276.0s)]
*  Matthew. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2281.6s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. Go ahead. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2282.3999999999996s)]
*  Good afternoon. With Nicaragua, pulling out of the OAS, the Organization of American States, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2283.2s)]
*  I saw your tweet. I saw the State Department's reaction to that letter. But how much more [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2290.56s)]
*  difficult is it now to hold the Ortega regime responsible for human rights abuses now that [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2295.2s)]
*  they're out of the OAS? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2300.32s)]
*  So we believe – so I will say that we will continue to call for the release of political [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2302.08s)]
*  prisoners in Nicaragua. We will continue to work with our allies and partners in the region. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2309.6s)]
*  We do see them trying to avoid accountability measures, including by departing the OAS, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2314.48s)]
*  and it's something we will continue to work with our allies and partners with. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2322.56s)]
*  One more question, if I may. It's a separate topic. I should have said separate topic earlier. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2326.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2330.24s)]
*  That's – there's no rule on how you preface the question, so. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2330.56s)]
*  I know we're all around the world here, so. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2334.48s)]
*  This is sort of specific here, so bear with me here. Foreign-born religious workers in the [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2337.8399999999997s)]
*  U.S. here on temporary work visas. They're very worried that they're going to be sent back to their [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2342.72s)]
*  countries because of a change in how green cards are processed. Basically, they have to wait in a [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2349.04s)]
*  longer line to get their green card, but they're worried in the meantime their temporary work visa [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2354.64s)]
*  will expire, and they'll be sent back to their country of origin. Bottom line is they're worried [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2358.9599999999996s)]
*  they're going to – their flocks are going to be left behind, their congregations are going to be [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2364.64s)]
*  left behind. Does the State Department share those concerns with those religious workers? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2367.68s)]
*  Are you aware of that? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2371.4399999999996s)]
*  You were right. That is a very specific question. Let me take it back and get you an answer. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2372.16s)]
*  Shannon, go ahead. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2375.68s)]
*  Thank you. Your counterpart at the NSC, John Cooper, was also very careful, but he did say that the [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2376.3199999999997s)]
*  State Department might play a role in processing any released American hostages that might want to [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2380.7999999999997s)]
*  come home, suggesting it might look like the way non-hostages coming out of Gaza are processed by [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2385.6s)]
*  consular officers. Can you say anything more? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2391.8399999999997s)]
*  All I would say is that with respect to any released hostage, it would be the same as [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2393.52s)]
*  with respect to any American in the world who needs assistance. We would provide them whatever [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2398.48s)]
*  consular assistance we can, and that obviously is true for any released hostages. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2403.12s)]
*  And on the Americans in Gaza, do you have an updated number of how many are seeking to leave [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2407.52s)]
*  the enclave? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2411.28s)]
*  It is still – so we have gotten around 800 American citizens, legal permanent residents, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2412.56s)]
*  and their family members out. I don't have any update in terms of the numbers who are seeking [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2418.88s)]
*  to leave from the number I gave yesterday, which was around 1,200. But again, that's not the number [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2422.96s)]
*  of American citizens. That's American citizens and family members and others. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2426.88s)]
*  Alex, go ahead. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2432.6400000000003s)]
*  Back to Ukraine, if you don't mind. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2433.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2434.7200000000003s)]
*  Today marks 10 years since Ukraine's [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2434.88s)]
*  revolution of dignitaryism. I'll give you a chance to speak to that. Kremlin keeps calling it [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2437.2000000000003s)]
*  a quote-unquote foreign-sponsored coup. And separately, Russian foreign miss officials [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2442.08s)]
*  of the day were quoted as saying that the coexistence with Ukrainian current quote-unquote [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2446.7200000000003s)]
*  regime is not possible. What is your understanding? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2452.08s)]
*  Say that last part again. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2455.44s)]
*  I missed it. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2456.4s)]
*  The coexistence with the Ukrainian regime is not possible, they say. What is your understanding of [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2456.96s)]
*  what they are saying here, and what is your reaction? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2462.8s)]
*  Well, so I think my reaction would be is that you continue to see the Russian government make [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2464.64s)]
*  outrageous and unacceptable statements about Ukraine. And so it just reinforces our conviction [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2470.56s)]
*  to continue to supply Ukraine with the assistance that it needs to defend itself, to repel Russian [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2477.12s)]
*  aggression from its borders. We've seen Russia make – and that applies to the first part of [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2482.48s)]
*  your question as well – the amount of Russian propaganda that we hear about Ukraine didn't just [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2487.92s)]
*  start this year. Last year it has been going on for a number of years. And it reaffirms, as I said, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2492.16s)]
*  our commitment and I think heightens the need for Congress to take action to pass the supplemental [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2497.68s)]
*  requests that we've sent up to Ukraine. The Secretary just today had a call with his G7 [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2503.36s)]
*  counterparts to talk about additional steps that we are taking through the United States and we [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2509.76s)]
*  are taking in concert with our allies and partners and in cooperation with the government of Ukraine [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2515.0400000000004s)]
*  to try to harden Ukraine's infrastructure in advance of the winter. Last winter we saw [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2519.5200000000004s)]
*  Russia striking energy sites, trying to take them down in Ukraine, and so we are working with Ukraine [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2525.44s)]
*  to try to harden its infrastructure in advance of this winter. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2530.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2533.5200000000004s)]
*  As you often were talking about, Maidan's anniversary. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2533.76s)]
*  I – just what I already said. Go ahead. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2537.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2540.1600000000003s)]
*  Alex, somebody – that's a few minutes. Go ahead and then we're going to wrap here. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2540.7200000000003s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2544.6400000000003s)]
*  Thank you, Matt. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2545.44s)]
*  Go ahead and we're going to have to wrap up. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2546.2400000000002s)]
*  This morning's North Korea missile launch, I understand NSC put out a statement saying you [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2548.0s)]
*  guys are still making assessments, but according to Yonhap, North Korea is claiming that it [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2552.96s)]
*  successfully put a spy satellite in orbit. So are you able to confirm whether or not the launch was [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2557.44s)]
*  successful? And if so, how does this change the security situation in the region and for the U.S.? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2563.28s)]
*  So I cannot confirm that assessment. It is still something that's ongoing inside the United States [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2569.84s)]
*  government. I can say that we condemn the DPRK's unlawful launch of a military reconnaissance [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2575.84s)]
*  satellite today. This launch utilized ballistic missile technology, which includes space launch [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2580.88s)]
*  vehicles. It violates multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions, and we will continue [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2586.32s)]
*  to work with the international community to send a strong signal to the DPRK that its actions will [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2591.84s)]
*  only intensify its isolation as it undermines stability and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2597.1200000000003s)]
*  So can you say how concerning it would be if North Korea had a spy satellite? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2602.56s)]
*  I'm just not going to speak to that before we've made a formal assessment. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2606.8s)]
*  With that, we'll wrap for today. I hope everyone has a safe and restful and peaceful Thanksgiving. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2610.32s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2615.28s)]
*  you [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9dPtmJeHk&t=2621.84s)]
