# Israeli ambassador Michael Herzog says strikes "prevented an escalation to a major war"
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [August 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A)
*  And we're joined by the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Michael Herzog. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=0.0s)]
*  Ambassador, good to have you here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=3.84s)]
*  Good morning, Margaret. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=5.2s)]
*  So we just heard about the casualties. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=6.8s)]
*  Tell me, was this friendly fire? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=10.8s)]
*  Did Hezbollah, as they claim, actually cause some Israeli casualties? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=13.52s)]
*  So what happened yesterday is that we identified concrete planning [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=18.56s)]
*  and preparation by Hezbollah to launch a massive missile and drone attack into Israel. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=23.76s)]
*  And we carried the real-time operation in order to degrade those capabilities [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=30.08s)]
*  that were about to be launched at Israel. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=35.76s)]
*  We were successful. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=37.6s)]
*  Nevertheless, they launched several hundred rockets into Israel, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=39.6s)]
*  and also drones that were aimed at central Israel, and we intercepted all of them. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  One of our soldiers was killed by the debris of Israeli interceptors. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=50.24s)]
*  Do you assess at this point that we are escalating towards a regional war, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=54.72s)]
*  or that we are taking a step back? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=62.72s)]
*  Is there risk of escalation? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=65.36s)]
*  I believe that the success of our operation yesterday prevented an escalation to a major war. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=67.28s)]
*  This threat is still there. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=74.64s)]
*  We still need a settlement with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=76.08s)]
*  They followed Hamas by launching a war at Israel on October 8th, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=81.83999999999999s)]
*  and they have been firing thousands of rockets into Israel since then. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=88.64s)]
*  We give a chance to diplomacy, and we hope it works. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  But if not, we have nearly 70,000 people in Israel, northern Israel, away from their homes, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  refugees in their own country, and we have to make sure they can go back safely to their homes. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  And many in southern Lebanon also unable to return to their homes. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=109.91999999999999s)]
*  It's being reported that Israel and Hezbollah have been trading messages back and forth [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=114.88s)]
*  not to escalate. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  I know that the Qatari Prime Minister is headed to Iran tomorrow with a message not to escalate. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=121.28s)]
*  Do you believe that you can avoid a direct attack by Iran on Israel? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=129.2s)]
*  I believe so. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=135.68s)]
*  I think the Iranians are contemplating an attack on Israel, but decided for now [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=136.56s)]
*  to put it on hold. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=143.84s)]
*  I think the main reason for that was deterrent messages from Israel and the U.S. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=145.68s)]
*  and a very strong U.S. poster in the region, which tells you that you can deter them. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  There are 40,000 U.S. troops now in the region. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=157.68s)]
*  What is it that you think General C.Q. Brown will do when he arrives in Israel later today? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=161.76s)]
*  Is this further planning for potential attacks? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, as I said, we do not seek war, and we don't believe that they seek war. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=172.48s)]
*  However, there is room for miscalculation, and I think part of his regional visit is to make sure [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=177.04s)]
*  that everything is under control. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  Again, the U.S. poster in the region is very strong. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=185.6s)]
*  In Cairo, you mentioned the diplomacy that is underway. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=188.96s)]
*  The CIA Director Bill Burns is there, Brett McGurk, one of the president's top advisors as well. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=192.4s)]
*  Hamas has sent a political delegation to Cairo. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=198.16s)]
*  Now, we know it is Yahya Sinwar who is the ultimate decider here, but do you see that there is [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=203.2s)]
*  momentum in these talks? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=209.68s)]
*  Is a breakthrough that brings home the power of the U.S. and the U.S. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=211.68s)]
*  We certainly hope so. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=215.6s)]
*  As we speak, we have an Israeli delegation in Cairo, along with all the mediators and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=217.12s)]
*  a Hamas representative, and we hope to make progress. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=223.12s)]
*  As Secretary Blinken said a few days ago, the U.S. put forward a bridging proposal, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=227.12s)]
*  which was accepted by Israel, and now it's up to Hamas to say if they accept it or not. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=232.24s)]
*  So they did send a delegation to Cairo, and they are now in the process of making [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=238.08s)]
*  the representative. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=244.88s)]
*  We're still not 100% sure that they are in the game. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=246.0s)]
*  We certainly hope so, and if that is the case, we can make progress towards a deal. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=249.76s)]
*  The Secretary of State did say the bridging proposal was accepted, but then your prime [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  minister has said things publicly that seem to contradict that in terms of the specifics, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=258.56s)]
*  particularly among that Philadelphia corridor. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=263.44s)]
*  What is reality? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=266.64s)]
*  The reality is that we are not obliged to leave the Philadelphia corridor at this phase. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=268.48s)]
*  We are reducing our forces there. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=274.96s)]
*  We had constructive talks in Egypt a few days ago. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=277.2s)]
*  We are well coordinated with the U.S. administration. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=281.92s)]
*  We are waiting for Hamas to see if they are in the game. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=285.12s)]
*  When you say in this phase, are you being specific in saying that's not part of phase [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=288.08s)]
*  one of this multi-phase diplomatic deal the U.S. is trying to put up? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=292.56s)]
*  The deal is multi-phase, as you said, but we are now focusing on phase one. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=296.32s)]
*  And phase one, we hope to get as many life hostages out as possible. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=302.0s)]
*  It comes with a pause in our military operation for at least 42 days. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=307.67999999999995s)]
*  And in that period, we hope that, again, we can release as, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=313.35999999999996s)]
*  get out as many life hostages as possible every day that passes in danger of their lives. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  Ambassador Herzog, thank you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zrlRuSY8A&t=326.23999999999995s)]
