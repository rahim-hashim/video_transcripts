# U.S. assisting Israel to find intelligence "gaps" ahead of Oct. 7 attack, Rep. Mike Turner says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [December 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk)
*  We're joined now by the chair of the House Intelligence [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=0.0s)]
*  Committee, Congressman Mike Turner. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=2.04s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=3.98s)]
*  Good to have you here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=4.44s)]
*  Good morning, Margaret. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=5.08s)]
*  So our colleagues here at CBS have [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=6.04s)]
*  heard from more Israeli soldiers, mainly female, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=8.0s)]
*  saying that they had reported up the chain of command warnings [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=10.56s)]
*  about a potential Hamas attack. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  The New York Times, the FT, they have details, specific ones, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=16.04s)]
*  going back a year. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=20.52s)]
*  The White House says this wasn't shared with US intelligence. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=22.68s)]
*  If this is America's closest Mideast ally, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=26.44s)]
*  should that concern us? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=28.72s)]
*  Well, I think what you saw was just a general dismissal [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  by Israel and Israel's intelligence community [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  of the possibility of this level of a threat, which really [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  goes to the complete breakdown that occurred here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=41.16s)]
*  It's been amazing to have our intelligence committee now [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=44.36s)]
*  working closely with the Israeli intelligence committee [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=47.68s)]
*  and see the gaps that they have. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=49.84s)]
*  And this obviously could have been an institutional bias, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=51.76s)]
*  the result of them dismissing it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  But the other aspect that made this so dangerous [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=56.0s)]
*  is that even when October 7 began to unfold, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=58.44s)]
*  their forces didn't react. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=61.96s)]
*  They didn't have the deployment ability [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=63.68s)]
*  to respond, not just the intelligence [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=65.48s)]
*  ability to prevent it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=67.24s)]
*  Which raises questions now about, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  have those gaps been filled? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=71.16s)]
*  How can you take Israeli assurances [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=72.64s)]
*  that everything they're doing is precise and targeted [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=74.44s)]
*  and exact? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=76.84s)]
*  Does the United States know where [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=78.44s)]
*  Yahya Sinwar, the commander who was the architect of this, is? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=81.08s)]
*  Israel says that he's in South Gaza. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=84.72s)]
*  Well, certainly the United States [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=87.92s)]
*  is assisting in the location of Hamas leadership [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  as Israel moves to eliminate the threat of Hamas. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=92.16s)]
*  And I just received a briefing from CIA Director Burns [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  on Friday, who just came back from the Middle East. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=98.12s)]
*  He's been working diligently. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=100.64s)]
*  He's doing a great job on negotiating [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=101.84s)]
*  for the release of hostages and also [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=103.88s)]
*  in trying to make certain that our intelligence apparatus is [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=105.88s)]
*  working closely with Israel to try [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  to fill some of those gaps that they clearly have. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=110.04s)]
*  You know, when it comes to what the United States is doing, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=114.44s)]
*  for our own standards, for our own government, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=117.24s)]
*  we have to have a nearly certain standard when [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=120.8s)]
*  it comes to counter-terrorism, lethal operations, positive ID [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=123.0s)]
*  of the target, no civilian casualties. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=126.88s)]
*  Should we hold our allies, who we provide with weapons [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=129.92s)]
*  and intelligence, to that exact same standard? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=132.84s)]
*  Well, I can tell you that we are being selective as [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=135.56s)]
*  to the information that's being provided. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  It's one thing to be able to look [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  to try to identify a specific individual [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  and provide information as to their location and operations [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=144.16s)]
*  and actually directing an operation. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, Director Burns has been very clear [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=150.24s)]
*  that we are not just providing direct access [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=152.68s)]
*  to our intelligence. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=154.44s)]
*  And that certainly gives us the ability to have caution. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=155.72s)]
*  Is Israel, though, operating on that intelligence [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=159.32s)]
*  to the level, to the standard that they should, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=163.0s)]
*  that the United States holds itself to? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=165.92s)]
*  Because we just heard from the Defense Secretary [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  and the Vice President that it certainly sounds the US [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=169.4s)]
*  assessment is they're not. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=172.6s)]
*  With respect to the use of US intelligence, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=174.04s)]
*  I can tell you that that's certainly [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=176.04s)]
*  how the United States is operating [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=177.24s)]
*  and holding them to that standard. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=178.8s)]
*  Now, broadly, as you've reported, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=179.84s)]
*  the United States is very concerned to the extent [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=182.52s)]
*  that Israel is not doing enough to protect civilians. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=184.4s)]
*  And certainly the issue goes even broader [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=188.12s)]
*  to the issue of humanitarian aid being provided [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=189.76s)]
*  to the Palestinians who are equally prisoners of Hamas. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=192.32s)]
*  Can aid, which is being bundled in the Senate [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=196.36s)]
*  with Ukraine aid to Israel and Ukraine, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=200.48s)]
*  get through the Republican-controlled House [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=203.96s)]
*  if the stipulation, as I understand it [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=207.0s)]
*  from the Speaker of the House, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=209.04s)]
*  is that it has to also include provisions [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=210.16s)]
*  regarding the US border? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=212.8s)]
*  Sure, Speaker Johnson's doing a great job. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=214.28s)]
*  And he is directly negotiating both with the White House [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=215.96s)]
*  and with the Senate on the aid package, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=219.44s)]
*  which would include aid to Israel, aid to Ukraine, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=221.12s)]
*  and also Southeast Asia. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=223.4s)]
*  But more importantly, in the negotiation process, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=224.8s)]
*  it would include changes in our southern border policy, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=227.6s)]
*  which even Director Wray has identified [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=230.72s)]
*  as a national security threat. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=232.36s)]
*  Those negotiations are ongoing, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=234.32s)]
*  and it's gonna take the administration [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=235.8s)]
*  coming to the table and recognizing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=237.88s)]
*  that their policy needs to change. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=239.32s)]
*  America overwhelmingly wants the southern border addressed. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=240.8s)]
*  It represents a national security threat [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=243.32s)]
*  as his own security advisors are telling him. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=244.88s)]
*  We can't have millions of people continue [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=248.28s)]
*  to cross our border and at all believe [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=250.08s)]
*  that we have a secure country with our national security. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=252.56s)]
*  What's the specific on that? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=257.24s)]
*  Because the White House is asking for like $14 billion. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  Are you saying the money's not enough? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=260.28s)]
*  You want an overhaul of immigration policy [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=262.44s)]
*  that hasn't happened in decades [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=264.36s)]
*  and for that to happen in the next three weeks? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=265.92s)]
*  Well, actually, there have been things [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=267.56s)]
*  that happened decades. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=268.68s)]
*  If you look back at the Trump administration, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=269.52s)]
*  where they had positions at policies [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  such as remain in Mexico, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=273.4s)]
*  there were policies that were working [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=274.91999999999996s)]
*  that were keeping the southern border controlled, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=277.0s)]
*  where the number of people- [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=279.12s)]
*  And that's a specific ask now. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=279.96s)]
*  And that is a specific ask now, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=280.8s)]
*  where the number of people crossing is diminished. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=281.88s)]
*  The administration can make changes, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  which other administrations have enforced, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=285.96s)]
*  that change the difference. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=288.2s)]
*  It's the reversal of those policies [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  that have caused Biden's southern border policies [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=291.56s)]
*  to be a failure and the millions of people [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=293.71999999999997s)]
*  to have entered our country. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=295.56s)]
*  So I want to ask you something else that Congress, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=296.79999999999995s)]
*  I know you think, needs to get done [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=299.44s)]
*  in a very short period of time, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=301.28s)]
*  and that is reauthorizing Section 702. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  We talked about it there as directly related [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  to America's own terror threat [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=307.4s)]
*  and being able to have warrantless surveillance powers. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=310.35999999999996s)]
*  Mark Warner, your colleague over in the Senate, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  says the main challenge to getting this done [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=315.36s)]
*  is your Ohio Republican colleague, Jim Jordan, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=317.56s)]
*  who he says wants to take the FBI out of the process. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=320.64s)]
*  So can you get Jordan and the Freedom Caucus, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=323.36s)]
*  of which your speaker is a member, on board with this? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think so. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=328.96s)]
*  702 is one of our most important tools [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=329.8s)]
*  for monitoring foreign individuals [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=331.36s)]
*  located outside the United States [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=333.44s)]
*  who pose a national security threat to our country. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=334.68s)]
*  And it's about to expire. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=337.48s)]
*  And it's about to expire at the end of the year. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=338.32s)]
*  It does not monitor the United States citizens. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=339.4s)]
*  I think there are those who look at the behavior of the FBI [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=342.36s)]
*  and want to punish the FBI foolishly [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=344.92s)]
*  by cutting off one of our most important tools [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=347.16s)]
*  to target at foreign individuals. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=349.6s)]
*  It certainly is also one of our most important tools [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=351.6s)]
*  that we're using to help Israel in this conflict. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=353.64000000000004s)]
*  How's that? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=356.72s)]
*  It allows us to monitor foreign, through this program, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  we monitor Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=360.24s)]
*  Some of our most ardent adversaries [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=362.88s)]
*  are monitored in this program. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=365.56s)]
*  And certainly we shouldn't punish the FBI [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=366.92s)]
*  for what they've done in other areas [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  to hinder our ability to track terrorists and our adversaries. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  Has Speaker Johnson committed to taking this version [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=375.32s)]
*  that the intelligence chairs are proposing [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=378.04s)]
*  versus Jim Jordan's version [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=380.32s)]
*  that wants to take the FBI out of this? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=381.64s)]
*  Right, so we have a bill. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  Myself, Jim Himes, Darren LaHood, Brian Fitzpatrick, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=384.48s)]
*  Senator Warner, Senator Rubio, and Senator Cornyn [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  have a bipartisan bicameral bill [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=389.88s)]
*  that would address some of the past abuses of the FBI, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=392.04s)]
*  prevent them from the future, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  and also reauthorize 702. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=397.2s)]
*  The Speaker is very supportive of that. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=399.76000000000005s)]
*  We've just got to get it over the line. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=401.96000000000004s)]
*  How? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, and that's the problem. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=404.6s)]
*  So I do think we've got substance on our side. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=406.08000000000004s)]
*  This is the way to go. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=409.12s)]
*  The individuals who want to hinder this process [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=410.40000000000003s)]
*  really, I think, don't fully understand how the process works [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=415.44000000000005s)]
*  and are really not understanding the value [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=418.16s)]
*  and the importance of this to our national security. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=421.76000000000005s)]
*  But then what we do see is Speaker Johnson saying yesterday [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=423.6s)]
*  on Fox he's going to hold a vote on the impeachment inquiry [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=427.0s)]
*  into President Biden. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=429.56s)]
*  You're talking about something of immediate national security [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=430.68s)]
*  threat, immediacy and timing, needing to prioritize that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=433.8s)]
*  But we're going to have an impeachment inquiry vote instead? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=437.2s)]
*  No, unfortunately, this is some of the legacy of the chaos [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=440.16s)]
*  that has happened in Congress, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=442.6s)]
*  where those who wanted to shut down the government [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=444.2s)]
*  at the end of the summer are some of those [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=446.16s)]
*  that want to stop the reauthorization of 702. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=447.48s)]
*  Are you going to vote for this impeachment inquiry next week? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=449.88s)]
*  We'll have to see what the evidence and the information is. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  It has not yet been presented to us. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=454.96s)]
*  Is that really the top priority, though? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=456.2s)]
*  You know, you can have more than one priority, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=457.84000000000003s)]
*  certainly, I think, protecting and enforcing our laws is a priority. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=459.44s)]
*  But in this, 702 is critical. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=462.59999999999997s)]
*  It needs to be reformed and reauthorized. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=465.03999999999996s)]
*  And the speaker is certainly committed to both those goals. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=468.44s)]
*  All right. It's always good to have you here in person. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=471.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. Mike Turner. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWP0tAoOPlk&t=473.96s)]
