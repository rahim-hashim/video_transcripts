# U.S. working on safe passage of Americans out of Gaza, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM)
*  We go now to White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=0.0s)]
*  Jake, I want to get straight to it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=4.0s)]
*  This is going to be very brutal urban warfare when Israel moves in to Gaza. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=7.0s)]
*  How much time do you have to get the 500 to 600 Americans trapped there out? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=12.0s)]
*  Well, Margaret, we're in daily, indeed hourly contact with our counterparts [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=17.0s)]
*  in the Israeli Defense Forces and security services. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=22.0s)]
*  We're talking to them about their plans for moving in on the ground in Gaza. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=25.0s)]
*  It's not for me to say what their timetable is. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=30.0s)]
*  I think they will need to speak to that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=33.0s)]
*  But we are very focused on, first, as you said, making sure that all American citizens in Gaza [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=35.0s)]
*  have safe passage out of Gaza and into Egypt. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=41.0s)]
*  We're working on that round the clock. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=44.0s)]
*  We're not going to rest until that happens. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=46.0s)]
*  And second, we're very focused on making sure that the broader civilian population of Gaza, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=48.0s)]
*  because the vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza have nothing to do with Hamas, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=53.0s)]
*  that they can get to safe areas, that they can get access to food, water, medicine, shelter, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=56.0s)]
*  and that they can be protected from the fighting as it intensifies [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=62.0s)]
*  and as a potential ground operation moves forward. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=66.0s)]
*  If any of those Palestinian civilians are permitted to leave Gaza, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=69.0s)]
*  does the United States have assurances from Israel that they will eventually be allowed to return to their homes, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=73.0s)]
*  or will they just become refugees? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=79.0s)]
*  The United States has a very simple proposition on this. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=81.0s)]
*  When people leave their homes in conflict, leave their houses in conflict, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=85.0s)]
*  they deserve the right to return to those homes, to those houses. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=88.0s)]
*  And this situation is no different. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=92.0s)]
*  The United States deployed a second aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=94.0s)]
*  I'm wondering if you have new intelligence that shows that the threat from Iran is growing. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=99.0s)]
*  We don't have some specific new intelligence that the threat is different today from yesterday. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=105.0s)]
*  The threat yesterday was real. The threat today is real. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=110.0s)]
*  There is a risk of an escalation of this conflict, the opening of a second front in the north, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=113.0s)]
*  and of course of Iran's involvement. That is a risk, and that's a risk that we have been mindful of since the start. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=118.0s)]
*  It's why the president moved so rapidly and decisively to get an aircraft carrier into the eastern Mediterranean, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=124.0s)]
*  to get aircraft into the Gulf, because he wants to send a very clear message of deterrence [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=132.0s)]
*  to any state or any actor that would seek to exploit this situation. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=139.0s)]
*  Well, Iran's foreign minister put out a public statement saying that Iran cannot remain a spectator. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=143.0s)]
*  What does that mean to you? Are you concerned about proxy forces, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=150.0s)]
*  or are you concerned that the state of Iran is getting drawn in? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=154.0s)]
*  Well, first, we are concerned about proxy forces. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=158.0s)]
*  Lebanese Hezbollah, a proxy force of Iran, is there a raid on Israel's northern border [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=161.0s)]
*  with considerable military capacity and a history of attacking the state of Israel. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=166.0s)]
*  And in fact, we have seen in the last few days skirmishes across that northern border. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=172.0s)]
*  That only enhances the risk of escalation. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=177.0s)]
*  But of course, we can't rule out that Iran would choose to get directly engaged some way. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=180.0s)]
*  We have to prepare for every possible contingency. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=184.0s)]
*  Is there diplomatic outreach to Iran right now? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=187.0s)]
*  We have means of communicating privately with Iran, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=189.0s)]
*  and we have availed ourselves of those means over the past few days [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=193.0s)]
*  to make clear privately that which we have said publicly. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=197.0s)]
*  But there are two million Palestinians living there, as you said, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=200.0s)]
*  many of whom have absolutely nothing to do with Hamas. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=203.0s)]
*  So at this point, are you expecting Israeli military forces to occupy that area long term [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=207.0s)]
*  who steps in and governs if Hamas is rooted out? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=213.0s)]
*  These are important long-term questions to begin asking and grappling with today. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=218.0s)]
*  We believe that Israel is grappling with them. We are talking to them about them. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=223.0s)]
*  It is absolutely critical, as President Biden said from the very beginning, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=227.0s)]
*  that we as fellow democracies, the U.S. and Israel, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=231.0s)]
*  that we embrace the rule of law and the laws of war, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=235.0s)]
*  and the United States will work with Israel, the United Nations, Egypt, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=239.0s)]
*  Jordan and other countries to do all that we can to ensure the protection of civilians [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=242.0s)]
*  and that those civilians have access to the basic necessities of food and water, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=248.0s)]
*  of shelter, of medicine. That is a priority of ours. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=252.0s)]
*  And the targeting of that kind of basic infrastructure is potentially a war crime, is it not? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=256.0s)]
*  There is a lot of fog of war. What we will say is the protection of civilians [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=261.0s)]
*  and the protection of those people who are trying to get to safety, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=266.0s)]
*  as well as their ability to access food, water, medicine, shelter, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=271.0s)]
*  these things should be respected and should very much be a central focus of everyone involved in this, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=276.0s)]
*  including ourselves, the Israelis, the United Nations and the regional countries. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=284.0s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority a long time ago renounced violence. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=289.0s)]
*  I saw President Biden spoke to Mahmoud Abbas yesterday. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=293.0s)]
*  Is your expectation that the Palestinian Authority would potentially govern Gaza? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=296.0s)]
*  And how concerned are you that violence will spread in the West Bank? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=301.0s)]
*  Look, again, I think you're asking a very important question about the long term in Gaza. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=305.0s)]
*  What I will say is this. Gaza being governed by a brutal and vicious terrorist organization [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=311.0s)]
*  is not just a challenge for the state of Israel, it's a challenge for the Palestinian people [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=317.0s)]
*  because Hamas does not represent their highest aspirations. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=322.0s)]
*  Hamas is not looking out for caring one iota about their welfare and well-being. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=325.0s)]
*  So the Palestinian people in Gaza do deserve a leadership that allows them to live lives in peace [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=332.0s)]
*  and dignity and security. What that exactly looks like going forward, I'm not in a position to say today, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=339.0s)]
*  but it is the right question to be asking now as this unfolds because we have to think [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=346.0s)]
*  not just about the immediate term but about the long term too. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=352.0s)]
*  This is not the only crisis you're dealing with. There's still a land war in Europe. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=355.0s)]
*  You said just a few days ago to congressional leaders that USAID to Ukraine was running dangerously low. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=359.0s)]
*  That as there's a renewed offensive. How close to crisis are we on that front? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=366.0s)]
*  We can continue to sustain deliveries of critical ammunition for them to defend against that Russian offensive [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=372.0s)]
*  and continue pressing forward in other areas in Ukraine. And you're right, Margaret, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=378.0s)]
*  that Russian offensive is very much underway. The Russians are throwing a lot at the Ukrainians [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=382.0s)]
*  in the northeast and the east, and we need to make sure that we continue rushing necessary military supplies to them. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=387.0s)]
*  We're doing that. But we need Congress to act, and the president has made clear that he is going to go to Congress [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=393.0s)]
*  with a package of funding for Ukraine as well as continued support for Israel. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=399.0s)]
*  You can expect intensive engagement with Congress this very week as we work on such a package [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=404.0s)]
*  and seek to secure bipartisan support for it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=410.0s)]
*  And that's a $2 billion package that would bundle Ukraine, Israel, the border, support for Taiwan altogether? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=413.0s)]
*  Well, the number is going to be significantly higher than that, but it will, as I said, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=419.0s)]
*  certainly include the necessary military equipment to defend freedom, sovereignty, and territorial integrity in Ukraine [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=424.0s)]
*  and to help Israel defend itself as it fights its terrorist foes. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=433.0s)]
*  Jake Sullivan, National Security Advisor to the President, thank you for your time today. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=438.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQwmBXDjmM&t=442.0s)]
