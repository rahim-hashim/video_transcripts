# More about the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and the role it plays
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4)
*  All right, the Department of Defense is closely monitoring any threats to that American air [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=0.0s)]
*  base in Qatar targeted by Iran and its retaliatory strikes. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=4.84s)]
*  So CBS News Pentagon correspondent Charlie Daggett joining us live now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=8.64s)]
*  Charlie, thanks for being here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=12.44s)]
*  Can you tell us more about the American assets on these bases? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=13.88s)]
*  Yeah, well first of all I have some more details to share. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=17.32s)]
*  This came from a defense official who said the missile attack on Al Udeid happened around [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=21.28s)]
*  730 local Central Command successfully defended against the attack, the official confirms. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=25.68s)]
*  As has been confirmed elsewhere, no injuries to personnel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=32.04s)]
*  But it's not just what it has at that base, but really what it is. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=35.72s)]
*  It's the main overseas hub for CENTCOM that stands for Central Command. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=39.68s)]
*  And that is responsible for overseeing Iran, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and part of the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=43.96s)]
*  evacuation of Afghanistan, which I actually was at Al Udeid for. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=49.36s)]
*  And more recently of course coordinating or helping to coordinate the attack against Iran. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=54.96s)]
*  So there's a good symbolic reason for Iran to take aim there. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  In terms of assets, there are roughly 8 or 9,000 troops. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=64.16s)]
*  That may have been minimized, I'll tell you why in a second. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=67.72s)]
*  It's about 60 acres, square acres. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=69.88s)]
*  It's got two 12,000 foot runways and it is equipped, among other things, with a battery [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=72.36s)]
*  of Patriot anti-missile systems. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=78.36s)]
*  But really it's just two huge runways and that's what it's there for. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=82.12s)]
*  And in terms of the assets that are there, there would be hardened shelters by the way [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  for troops to get down in and or under. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=90.92s)]
*  And it's not far from Iran. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  It's very close. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=98.0s)]
*  In fact, it's just across the sea. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=99.0s)]
*  So it's certainly within reach. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  And that's why it's been termed short and medium range missiles that were used to attack [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=101.72s)]
*  that base. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=106.36s)]
*  In terms of the aircraft, I've been there and I've seen dozens of aircraft, a lot of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=107.44s)]
*  cargo, some fighters, a lot of refueling. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=111.96s)]
*  It's sort of, as I said, it's a hub for Central Command's forward operating base for whatever [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=115.12s)]
*  operations are going on, including the fight against ISIS. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=122.08s)]
*  So it's a really big deal. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  But at the moment, there aren't that many there. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=127.36s)]
*  And that was done intentionally. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=129.92s)]
*  As I've been reporting for the past week or so, even before the attacks in Iran, the United [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=131.24s)]
*  States military has been dispersing a lot of its aircraft, a lot of a lot of its ships. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=136.76s)]
*  The fifth fleet's base based in Bahrain, also a potential target. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=142.68s)]
*  So they've been moving these things out, in their words, to reduce a lucrative target [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=146.8s)]
*  for the Iranians to aim at. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=152.12s)]
*  Is the Pentagon now mobilizing more assets, though, toward the Middle East in response? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=154.84s)]
*  Not yet in response. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=161.76s)]
*  Again, I'm told that this organization is a planning organization. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=163.2s)]
*  So they were prepping for this, essentially. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=167.56s)]
*  So I can report that the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier, which was pushed there from the Indo-Pacific [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=170.52s)]
*  region, has now entered Central Command. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=177.68s)]
*  The USS Vinson carrier strike group, that has already been there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=180.44s)]
*  So like in the Eastern Mediterranean, you've got five destroyers. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=184.96s)]
*  In the Red Sea, you've got three more destroyers. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  In the Arabian Sea, one, two, three, three more destroyers there. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=192.6s)]
*  Cruiser, the Princeton, and three others. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  So you've got more than a dozen destroyers. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=201.72s)]
*  And those are really important because those destroyers can launch cruise missiles and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=203.56s)]
*  interceptors, essentially to provide force protection. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=207.16s)]
*  And also, as we now know, there's at least one submarine there, probably a number of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=210.88s)]
*  submarines. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  I don't think we can talk about that for obvious reasons. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=216.84s)]
*  But one submarine that was involved in the attack against Iran, where it fired 24 Tomahawk [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  cruise missiles. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=224.8s)]
*  So you're talking about a ton of military hardware, primarily for force protection, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=225.8s)]
*  but then just, you know, it's a security blanket against whatever Iran might throw at them. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Charlie Daggett, Charlie, thank you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B18h0EwndP4&t=236.72000000000003s)]
