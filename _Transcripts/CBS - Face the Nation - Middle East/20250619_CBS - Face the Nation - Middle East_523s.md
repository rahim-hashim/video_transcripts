# Trump doesn't rule out negotiations with Iran
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo)
*  Hello and thank you for joining us. President Trump says he will make a decision on striking Iran within the next two weeks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=0.0s)]
*  The president said in a statement today he believes there is still a chance to negotiate with Iran in the near future. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=7.0s)]
*  But he has also repeatedly said Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=13.0s)]
*  Earlier, White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt told reporters the U.S. believes Iran is closer than ever to obtaining nuclear arms. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=18.0s)]
*  Iran has all that it needs to achieve a nuclear weapon. All they need is a decision from the supreme leader to do that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=26.0s)]
*  And it would take a couple of weeks to complete the production of that weapon, which would of course pose an existential threat not just to Israel but to the United States and to the entire world. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=33.0s)]
*  Those comments come as tensions rise over an Iranian attack on the largest hospital in southern Israel. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=43.0s)]
*  No one was killed, but dozens of people did suffer minor injuries. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=49.0s)]
*  Israel is now accusing Iran of war crimes and says it will hold the supreme leader accountable. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=53.0s)]
*  While speaking outside the hospital, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised President Trump when asked about the possibility of the United States joining the fight. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=59.0s)]
*  President Trump will do what's best for America. I trust his judgment. He's a tremendous friend, a tremendous world leader, a tremendous friend of Israel and the Jewish people. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=69.0s)]
*  And we will do what we have to do and we are doing it. We are committed to destroying the nuclear threat, the threat of a nuclear annihilation against Israel. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=79.0s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Deborah Pata is following the latest from Tel Aviv. Deborah? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=90.0s)]
*  There will probably be a lot of senior Israeli government officials who are hoping that President Trump would make a decision on whether to join Israel's war in Iran a lot more quickly. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=96.0s)]
*  Instead, he's given Iran two weeks to give up its nuclear program. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=109.0s)]
*  And once again today you saw Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu almost baiting President Trump, saying Iran was stringing Trump along and nobody strings Trump along. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=113.0s)]
*  It is clear Israel wants a military response and as for Iran, they have warned of serious consequences if the U.S. gets involved in this war. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=126.0s)]
*  But at the same time, Iran's foreign minister Abbas Arakchi will meet with his counterparts from France, Germany and the UK in Geneva for another diplomatic push. Back to you. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=137.0s)]
*  Deborah Pata, thank you. And CBS News senior national correspondent, national security correspondent Charlie Daggett joins us now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=150.0s)]
*  Charlie, very good to see you with so much at stake here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=156.0s)]
*  How would you characterize the mood there at the Pentagon as the president weighs entering the conflict? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=160.0s)]
*  Yeah, Nancy, you know, the whole job of the Pentagon and the DOD is to provide the commander in chief, in this case, President Trump with options. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=166.0s)]
*  And Secretary of Defense Pete Hegs has said exactly that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=175.0s)]
*  And there are several options. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=179.0s)]
*  But I want to point out what Caroline Levitt said earlier. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=181.0s)]
*  She said, quoting President Trump, I will make my decision of whether or not to go in within the next two weeks. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=183.0s)]
*  That doesn't necessarily mean it's two weeks from now. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=188.0s)]
*  It might be in the next two weeks, 24 hours, 48 hours. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=190.0s)]
*  And in preparation for that, I can tell you what the Pentagon is doing to prepare. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=193.0s)]
*  Most of this, I'm told, is about force protection in that area. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=199.0s)]
*  There are 40,000 U.S. forces spread throughout the Middle East, some in established military installations, huge bases like the Fifth Fleet and Bahrain throughout the UAE, others that are a little more vulnerable and exposed. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=204.0s)]
*  I'm thinking about Iraq, Syria, northern Iraq. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=217.0s)]
*  In terms of military assets, I've got a list here because I've been quoting it all day. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=220.0s)]
*  USS Carl Vinson is in the Arabian Sea. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=223.0s)]
*  Now, this is a carrier strike group with several destroyers. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=226.0s)]
*  They've got three additional destroyers in the Eastern Mediterranean. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=229.0s)]
*  There are three destroyers in the Arabian Sea with the Carl Vinson. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=232.0s)]
*  On the way, another destroyer, a carrier, sorry, another aircraft carrier strike group with three additional destroyers. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=236.0s)]
*  The General, our forward carrier group is headed to UCOM, the European Command, which is kind of within striking distance itself. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=245.0s)]
*  So we are talking about really forward-postured. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=253.0s)]
*  In addition to that, several aircraft squadrons, there are F-15s, sorry, F-16s, F-35s, F-22s that are on the way. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=256.0s)]
*  Those are new, and they're also refuelers. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=264.0s)]
*  And that's kind of important because they are important to refuel fighters in order to loiter over areas where U.S. forces are, but also to refuel long-range bombers. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=268.0s)]
*  In case of a strike against Iran. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=285.0s)]
*  So basically what the DOD is trying to do and the Pentagon is doing, they're a planning organization. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=288.0s)]
*  You know, people say, are they preparing for war? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=294.0s)]
*  Every day they prepare for war. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=296.0s)]
*  That's what they do. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=297.0s)]
*  And they're providing the president with these options. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=298.0s)]
*  But yes, the kind of military hardware that we're talking about and the troop deployment and the types of military hardware, it's about force protection. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=301.0s)]
*  But also it's a projection, sending a message to the Iranians that they're there. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=311.0s)]
*  Three aircraft carriers and all those destroyers. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=315.0s)]
*  These are things that launch cruise missiles. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=318.0s)]
*  They have already been engaged in terms of defending Israel against Iranian attacks, intercepting some of the missiles that have come in. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=321.0s)]
*  So yes, about as forward-postured as I can remember in recent years. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=328.0s)]
*  Many people will be watching, the world will be watching over the next two weeks. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=332.0s)]
*  Charlie Daggett, thank you very much for your reporting. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=336.0s)]
*  CBS News White House reporter Willie James Inman joins us now. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=339.0s)]
*  And Willie, given all of this, where is the president on a decision about Iran and the possibility of a diplomatic solution here? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=343.0s)]
*  Hey there, Nancy. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=351.0s)]
*  With that two-week timeline, the president is leaving the door open for those negotiations to take place. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=353.0s)]
*  In fact, Caroline Levitt essentially said that that message about the president's stance will be relayed via the Europeans when they meet with the Iranian foreign minister tomorrow. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=360.0s)]
*  We know that the president has seen those attack plans, those U.S. attack plans, has approved the plan, but has not made that final decision just yet. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=373.0s)]
*  And today we have that updated timeline of two weeks. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=383.0s)]
*  But I'll also note that the president has really been forceful in terms of his public comments about the situation to negotiate a deal with Iran, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=387.0s)]
*  saying that Iran should have negotiated weeks ago, essentially saying that it's almost too late for Iran to come to the table for an agreement. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=397.0s)]
*  But the U.S. staying out of the fight for now, but as Charlie mentioned, preparing for any outcome that's defending U.S. forces and assets in the region, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=408.0s)]
*  but also preparing a situation where if the president calls for that strike, it could happen, Nancy. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=420.0s)]
*  But Willie, there are members of both parties who do not want the U.S. to get involved. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=426.0s)]
*  So how does the president respond to the parts of his base who do not want the U.S. in another war overseas? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=430.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=436.0s)]
*  And there's, in fact, a resolution, a bipartisan resolution calling to stop the president from getting involved in a conflict in Iran. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=439.0s)]
*  And the president touched on this yesterday when the question was posed to him about his elect, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=449.0s)]
*  his, him being elected and him essentially saying that he wants to keep America out of foreign wars. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=456.0s)]
*  He said, quote, My supporters don't want to see Iran have a nuclear weapon. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=462.0s)]
*  We, of course, know that this president has really been more so on the isolationist side, not wanting to get involved in foreign conflicts, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=467.0s)]
*  not wanting to prolong America's foreign military power and project it overseas. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=476.0s)]
*  But in terms of projecting that power, when it's useful, when it's a negotiation tactic, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=483.0s)]
*  we know that this president has done that in this case with Iran. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=487.0s)]
*  But still, nonetheless, a lot of the president's supporters not wanting him to get involved in this conflict. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=492.0s)]
*  We, of course, know that on the campaign trail, the president talked about not being involved in those conflicts. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=498.0s)]
*  And we'll have to wait and see as to what happens and what decision the president makes within the next two weeks. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=503.0s)]
*  But we know that the White House, the president included top U.S. officials wanting a diplomatic end, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=509.0s)]
*  at least to this situation and those brewing tensions in the Middle East. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=515.0s)]
*  Nancy Willie James and thank you very much for joining us. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woAvChAP6mo&t=519.0s)]
