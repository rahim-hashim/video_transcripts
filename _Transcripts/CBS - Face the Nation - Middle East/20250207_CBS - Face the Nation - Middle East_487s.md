# Speaker Johnson, Netanyahu give remarks without mentioning Trump's Gaza plan
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU)
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the Capitol [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=0.0s)]
*  today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=5.08s)]
*  The leaders reaffirmed the U.S.-Israeli relationship and spoke about their mutual respect. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=6.08s)]
*  Now, they did not take any follow-up questions after the meeting despite push from reporters [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=11.24s)]
*  out there, but let's take a listen to what was said. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=16.62s)]
*  I'm now completing the week which began with an extraordinary meeting with President Trump. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=20.12s)]
*  And under his leadership, the critical decisions that show his commitment and the American [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=26.72s)]
*  people's commitment to Israel have come to the fore instantly. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=33.96s)]
*  Firstly, he renewed immediately the supply of the weapons that had been stopped, which [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  we need as we're fighting for our future, for our existence, and for the broader Middle [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=41.44s)]
*  East in a seven-front war. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=47.44s)]
*  He immediately released those weapons. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  He issued yesterday these sanctions on this scandalous and corrupt organization, the ICC, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=51.12s)]
*  that threatens the right of all democracies to defend themselves, by themselves, and he's [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=58.0s)]
*  done so many things in the interim, just in two weeks. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=63.44s)]
*  Today we discuss the special partnership that we have between these two countries, and I [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=66.24s)]
*  thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for his unrelenting commitment to making the region and the world [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=69.6s)]
*  a safer place amid really extraordinary challenges. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=75.08s)]
*  What Israel has done in the past seven months really is a testament to what can be accomplished [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=79.36s)]
*  when we do not let the enemy set the rules. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=83.24s)]
*  As Prime Minister Netanyahu said Tuesday at the White House, when our enemies see daylight [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  between Israel and the United States, they will exploit it, and we all know that is true. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=91.24s)]
*  And that's why strong, decisive leadership is so crucial in this time. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=96.68s)]
*  President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu both understand that peace is secured through [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=101.28s)]
*  strength, not appeasement, and not by turning our backs on our allies. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=105.04s)]
*  I can't wait. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=109.2s)]
*  You'll be welcome in a red carpet. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=110.2s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=113.36000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=114.36000000000001s)]
*  CBS News congressional reporter Torian Small joins us live now with the latest. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=115.36000000000001s)]
*  Torian, thank you for being with us again today. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=125.56s)]
*  What did we learn from the press conference that we just heard from Netanyahu and Johnson [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=128.28s)]
*  there? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=132.08s)]
*  Muga, we've learned these meetings that happened this week, including the one with Speaker [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=134.08s)]
*  Johnson today, served as this post-election affirmation of the U.S.'s alliance with Israel. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=138.32000000000002s)]
*  Speaker Johnson, as we just heard there, not only mentioning the strong ties the U.S. has [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=144.74s)]
*  with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but also his personal connection and friendship [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=151.12s)]
*  as we just heard the invite for Speaker Johnson to come to Israel at some point. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=158.08s)]
*  What was absent, though, from this very brief public press conference the two held was mention [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=164.84s)]
*  of Trump's announcement at the beginning of the week that the U.S. would be involved with [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=172.28s)]
*  the redevelopment of Gaza. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=178.24s)]
*  That was something that caught quite a few folks on the Hill off guard. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=180.76000000000002s)]
*  Speaker Johnson and Netanyahu failed to mention that was part of the discussion that they [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=184.4s)]
*  had behind closed doors. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  Johnson, or Netanyahu rather, also met with a bipartisan group of senators this week. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=190.8s)]
*  I spoke with Senator Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=195.4s)]
*  He was in that room and he told me that wasn't mentioned. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=199.3s)]
*  There's no expectation that the U.S. would not only be a part of that, but finance that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=201.84s)]
*  He believes the onus there should be left on nations in that region, Muga. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=206.6s)]
*  And also, as we said earlier, questions were not taken after those two met and spoke. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=212.11999999999998s)]
*  This morning, Speaker Johnson said details on a new budget resolution could be released [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  soon to help advance the president's agenda. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=221.88s)]
*  The Senate is also working on its own package. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  So the big question is, are they both on the same page? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=227.32s)]
*  That's unclear right now. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=232.48s)]
*  Senator Tom Tillis told CBS News yesterday that they're working on priorities that they [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  expect could get a bipartisan agreement, but also they don't need it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=240.0s)]
*  They have a slim majority in the Senate, so they're looking to utilize budget reconciliation. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=244.83999999999997s)]
*  Their top priority, it seems, coming from Tillis, though, is that they want to get through [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  a package that would first include funding for a border wall for the U.S.-Mexico border, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=254.94s)]
*  and then also those other priorities. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  It might not be this one big, beautiful bill that Donald Trump has talked about on the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=263.76s)]
*  campaign trail for quite a bit. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=268.68s)]
*  Republicans, though, in the House, appear to be more in line with Donald Trump's priorities [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=270.47999999999996s)]
*  and are looking to push through as much as they can through one piece of legislation. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=275.12s)]
*  Speaker Johnson, coming out of that meeting with the White House, with members of his [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=279.96s)]
*  conference, said that it appears that there are quite a few people in line, in lockstep, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=283.96s)]
*  with the president's thinking on this. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=290.44s)]
*  He talked to members of the House Freedom Caucus who are pretty much on board with this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=292.8s)]
*  As we know, that has been the biggest thorn in Johnson's side, appeasing and placating [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=297.64000000000004s)]
*  some of their concerns, but if he has their support, we'll just have to wait and see [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=304.44s)]
*  the text from that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=309.24s)]
*  That could come out as early as next week as he's looking to get it before the budget [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=310.24s)]
*  committee, like I said, as early as next week. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=314.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=317.44s)]
*  Wait and see, Tori, and that's exactly what we'll do. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=318.44s)]
*  I want to ask you about Russell Vosge, because we know the Senate just confirmed him as White [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=320.56s)]
*  House budget director. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=324.74s)]
*  How is policy expected to change with votes leading the White House Office of Management [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=326.6s)]
*  and Budget? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=331.40000000000003s)]
*  Democrats decried this confirmation saying that he would give President Trump as his [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  budget chief unfettered access to what they're calling this mantling of the federal government. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=339.32000000000005s)]
*  We're seeing a shift in strategy from Democrats, though. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=345.6s)]
*  They realize that the numbers are not in their favor. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=348.8s)]
*  has not been for Republicans to defect on some of these more controversial picks. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=351.48s)]
*  So now they're looking to delay these confirmations for as long as they can as Republicans look [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=356.64000000000004s)]
*  to fast track as many of Trump's nominees to his cabinet as possible. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  We're seeing them utilize things like opting for debate, and as we saw with Cash Patel's [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=366.64000000000004s)]
*  nomination, the Senate intel or judiciary, they're looking to push it off for as many [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=372.16s)]
*  weeks as they can. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=378.24s)]
*  Their idea behind this is to ensure that the American public get a full understanding, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=380.64s)]
*  as many hearings as possible on these nominees, and ultimately that could pay off in two years [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=385.79999999999995s)]
*  when it comes time for midterms. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=391.08s)]
*  Okay, so let's look ahead to next week. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=392.96s)]
*  That's when the Senate will vote on if to confirm two of Trump's most embattled cabinet [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=396.03999999999996s)]
*  picks. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=400.84s)]
*  We're talking about Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and RFK Jr. for secretary [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=401.84s)]
*  of health and human services. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=406.55999999999995s)]
*  What can we expect from the votes? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=408.58s)]
*  As you mentioned, it seems that the Republicans have the votes that they need to push both [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=410.21999999999997s)]
*  of these candidates through. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=415.0s)]
*  So are Democrats planning anything here to stop that? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=416.0s)]
*  The pathway is wide open, essentially. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=421.32s)]
*  Again, Democrats have not yet found four defectors in the Republican Party to effectively block [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=423.94s)]
*  these confirmations. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=430.14s)]
*  A lot of the Republican members on these respective panels that we were watching who had reservations [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=431.5s)]
*  before faced this immense pressure campaign from folks within the Trump world. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=437.58s)]
*  They ultimately decided to vote those two members out of, or nominees out of their respective [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=442.54s)]
*  committees because they said they got assurances not just from the candidates themselves, but [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=447.74s)]
*  also from members of the Trump White House. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=454.5s)]
*  We've known that JD Vance, the vice president, has been a power broker of sorts on the Hill [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=458.18s)]
*  talking to these members, being general counsel essentially to many of these members that [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=464.9s)]
*  have reservations. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=469.78s)]
*  In lieu of any significant pushback that we're seeing from Republicans, it's likely that [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=471.28s)]
*  those confirmations will happen sooner than later, much to the chagrin of Democrats. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=476.38s)]
*  All right, Torian Small, thank you so much for your insight. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=481.09999999999997s)]
*  We appreciate you spending time with us on the stream today. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wbkLPoJmPU&t=484.34s)]
