# Iran's supreme leader claims victory over Israel in first public comments since ceasefire
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU)
*  Our A's turn down to that fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Iran's supreme leader [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=0.0s)]
*  there delivered a televised address that we just talked about this morning. It was his [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=5.28s)]
*  first video message that the ceasefire began. Now in the pre-recorded video, he warned against [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=9.4s)]
*  any further U.S. attacks. CBS News foreign correspondent Imtiaz Tayyab has more from [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=15.3s)]
*  inside Tehran. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=20.7s)]
*  Well, after days of silence, Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, congratulated [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=22.26s)]
*  his country's, quote, victory over Israel. But after nearly two weeks of intense fighting, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=28.34s)]
*  Iran's airspace had been closed and over 600 people had been killed. Not to mention Iran's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=34.46s)]
*  nuclear program was badly devastated by those massive U.S. strikes. Now, we were speaking [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=39.78s)]
*  to a senior spokeswoman to the Iranian government who acknowledged that her country had essentially [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  ratified a parliamentary vote which would see them withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=53.2s)]
*  Treaty. But she stressed this was only a suspension and not a complete withdrawal, signaling hope [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=59.72s)]
*  that Iran and indeed the rest of the world, as well as the U.S., could find some path [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=66.72s)]
*  forward for Iran to pursue a domestic nuclear program. Whatever the case, we've also been [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=71.88s)]
*  hearing from President Trump who says that the U.S. and Iran could very likely meet for [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=78.6s)]
*  face-to-face talks as early as next week. Whatever the case, the mood here in the capital [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  city is very tense. The last time I was in Tehran was around five years ago, and the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  difference now couldn't be more stark. Despite being globally isolated and under heavy sanctions, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  this remains a vibrant and cosmopolitan city. But as we've been saying this morning, most [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  businesses still remain shut and the sense of nervousness is palpable. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=107.0s)]
*  Imtiaz Tai, CBS News, Tehran. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=112.0s)]
*  Imtiaz Tai, one of the few journalists actually allowed to go inside and report from Iran there. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED6m7UwPYbU&t=115.0s)]
