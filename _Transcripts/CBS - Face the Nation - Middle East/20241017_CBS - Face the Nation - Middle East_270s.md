# Biden says Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's death is "good day for Israel"
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU)
*  President Biden has just released a statement on the death of Yaya Sinwar. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=0.0s)]
*  The president said in part, quote, early this morning, Israeli authorities informed my national [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=3.6s)]
*  security team that a mission they conducted in Gaza likely killed Hamas leader Yaya Sinwar. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=8.08s)]
*  DNA tests have now confirmed that Sinwar is dead. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=13.56s)]
*  This is a good day for Israel, for the United States and for the world. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=16.76s)]
*  Biden went on to compare his death to the killing of Osama bin Laden. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=21.12s)]
*  As you see there, he is heading now to Germany. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=25.76s)]
*  He'll meet with European leaders for talks both on the Middle East as well as Ukraine. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=28.04s)]
*  And for more on this, I want to bring in CBS News White House reporter Willie James Inman. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=33.76s)]
*  He is traveling with the president. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=37.68s)]
*  You see him there in Berlin. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=39.48s)]
*  Willie, any response from the White House in particular? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=41.24s)]
*  I'm looking at President Biden's remarks here and he much like the vice president is calling [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  for a day after in Gaza without Hamas in power, he says. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  But with a political settlement that provides a better future for Israelis and Palestinians [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=56.32s)]
*  alike. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=60.8s)]
*  What are you hearing? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=61.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, Lana. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=62.8s)]
*  With both of these statements, the one in front of cameras with the vice president and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=66.76s)]
*  this paper statement that we received from the White House, from President Biden, they're [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=70.72s)]
*  essentially echoing the same thing, talking about that day after plan, talking about the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=75.32s)]
*  significance of this and comparing it to the death of Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=80.36s)]
*  September 11th in the eyes of the Israelis. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=85.48s)]
*  This has that type of significance. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  So the president is saying that in his statement there he will land here in Berlin in a couple [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  of hours. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=94.84s)]
*  We could potentially see the president given on camera statement. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=95.84s)]
*  But for now, this is what we have in terms of a response from the White House from the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  top of the administration. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=103.56s)]
*  President Biden is saying also in part to my Israeli friends, there is no doubt a day [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=105.16000000000001s)]
*  of relief and reminiscence similar to the scenes witnessed throughout the United States [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=110.12s)]
*  after President Obama ordered the raid to kill Osama bin Laden in 2011. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=114.24s)]
*  So the president sharing that significance there, of course, he was there as vice president, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  the number two behind President Obama when this decision was made in 2011, sharing some [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=124.56s)]
*  significance there, comparing this to what the Israelis are perhaps feeling and experiencing [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=130.28s)]
*  at now, Lana. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=136.0s)]
*  Willie, I'm going to read for our viewers another thing that the president said. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=137.0s)]
*  He says, I'll be speaking soon with Prime Minister Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=139.4s)]
*  to congratulate them to discuss the pathway for bringing the hostages home and ending [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=143.16s)]
*  this war once and for all. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=147.4s)]
*  Tell us a little bit more about the relationship that Biden and Netanyahu have had, especially [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  recently. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=155.04s)]
*  Yeah, recently, the relationship has been quite tense, to sum it up really quickly. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=156.04s)]
*  Both men have, of course, been having their national security teams talk to each other, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=164.12s)]
*  but they hadn't spoken in several weeks. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=169.48s)]
*  They spoke not too long ago. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=172.0s)]
*  And so essentially, the president saying he's going to have this call, this signifies how [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=175.04s)]
*  important this is. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=179.16s)]
*  Remember, the White House has been trying to get Israel to de-escalate tensions in the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  region. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=185.16s)]
*  In fact, earlier this week, a letter was sent from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=186.16s)]
*  Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to their counterpart in Israel warning that if the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=191.6s)]
*  humanitarian situation in Gaza did not improve, that the Israelis risk losing some of that [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  military aid that they so desperately need to be able to continue to defend themselves [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  from all of these attacks, not only from Hamas and from Hezbollah and Lebanon, but also from [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  Iran as well. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=212.92s)]
*  We, of course, have been anticipating some type of response from the Israelis in response [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=213.92s)]
*  to that Iranian missile attack on Israel just about a couple of weeks ago. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=219.2s)]
*  This is definitely a significant moment for Israel, for the United States as well. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=224.72s)]
*  President Biden saying in that statement as well that special operations, special forces [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=229.68s)]
*  were coordinating with the Israelis to be able to help find Sinwar. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=233.72s)]
*  In fact, that is what happened in this situation. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  But as you talked earlier in the hour with Olivia, by happenstance, this wasn't necessarily [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=241.88s)]
*  the target of this particular situation, but this happened, and the Israelis are essentially [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=247.44s)]
*  celebrating this moment. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  And so significant that President Biden is there to meet with international leaders about [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=255.16s)]
*  the war in the Middle East as well as the war in Ukraine. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=261.36s)]
*  And when we learn more about how those talks develop, you'll tell us about it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=264.24s)]
*  Willie James, Inman, thank you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGW1I1KeYLU&t=268.59999999999997s)]
