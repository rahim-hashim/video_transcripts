# Graham "very optimistic" about emerging House plan for border security and Ukraine, Israel aid
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [February 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o)
*  Congress is on a two-week recess, but there is an urgent push among some lawmakers to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=0.0s)]
*  do more to fund Ukraine. This weekend another major Ukrainian city fell to Russian [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=5.4s)]
*  forces, and at an annual security conference in Munich President Zelensky pleaded for [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=11.0s)]
*  more help from the U.S. and from allies around the world. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=16.0s)]
*  Do not ask Ukraine when the war will end. Ask yourself, why is Putin still able to continue it? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=20.0s)]
*  But the path forward for more U.S. aid remains uncertain. Last week the Senate passed [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=33.0s)]
*  a $95 billion foreign aid bill that included money for Ukraine, Israel and more, but the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=38.0s)]
*  GOP-controlled House is not expected to take up that measure. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=44.0s)]
*  South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who opposed the bipartisan Senate [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=48.0s)]
*  legislation, joins us now from Clemson, South Carolina. Senator, good morning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=53.0s)]
*  At this point, do you expect any new U.S. assistance for Ukraine from Congress? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=58.0s)]
*  Yes, I do. I feel very optimistic after having been on the phone all weekend talking with my [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=65.0s)]
*  House colleagues that there's a way forward regarding the border and Ukraine. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=72.0s)]
*  The Problem Solvers Caucus, Congressman Fitzpatrick and Gottheimer, I'm sorry, Josh, I can't remember your last name. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=77.0s)]
*  Gottheimer from New Jersey. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=86.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. They've got a pretty creative idea. Here's what they're saying. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=87.0s)]
*  Let's go back to remain in Mexico as a border security policy, and that was the number one request [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=92.0s)]
*  of the Border Patrol on our visit to Texas. Senator Scott, go back to remain in Mexico. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=98.0s)]
*  You have to wait in Mexico for your solemn claim. You're not released in the United States. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=103.0s)]
*  And secondly, to reinstitute Title 42, those two things on the border I think are simple, will work. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=107.0s)]
*  And they want to slim down the aid package to 60 billion, all lethal aid. And here's what I told them. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=116.0s)]
*  I think that's a winning combination. I suggested making the lethal aid alone, like President Trump has [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=123.0s)]
*  suggested. The Europeans gave Ukraine 50 billion dollars. 33 of it was a loan. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=129.0s)]
*  So I think if you turn the lethal aid into a loan, do remain in Mexico, Title 42, that combination not only gets [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=135.0s)]
*  through the House, it picks up votes in the Senate. It would be welcome relief to the Ukraine. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=145.0s)]
*  It'd be a blow to Putin. It will also help Israel and Taiwan. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=151.0s)]
*  Senator Graham, let's stop there for a moment. You stunned many of your colleagues and U.S. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=155.0s)]
*  allies around the world when you opposed this recent... [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=160.0s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=163.0s)]
*  No, you did with opposing this bipartisan legislation. Now it seems you are prepared to support this [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=164.0s)]
*  emerging House legislation from some of these centrist Republicans and Democrats. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=170.0s)]
*  To be clear, this is a $66 billion package that goes across Israel, Ukraine and border security. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=174.0s)]
*  Are you saying this morning that you are a yes vote on the Fitzpatrick House proposal? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=181.0s)]
*  Yes, I am saying that the House proposal, it depends on how it's written, makes perfect sense to me. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=187.0s)]
*  I think you'll pick up six to eight Republicans who want to help Ukraine but believe that the bipartisan [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=196.0s)]
*  border bill was not sufficient enough. Why did I vote no? I want to help ourselves by securing our border. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=203.0s)]
*  I want to help Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel. The border provisions were not adequate to the task [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=210.0s)]
*  and there were many good things. So Remain in Mexico is the number one game changer. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=217.0s)]
*  You put that in the package. You slim down the package to lethal aid. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=223.0s)]
*  But I would support humanitarian aid, smaller in number, if it was a loan. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=227.0s)]
*  Again, the Europeans have made 33 of their $50 billion transfer to Ukraine a loan. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=233.0s)]
*  Let's make it a loan. I think that gets you President Trump on the aid part. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=242.0s)]
*  Let's go to Remain in Mexico. We've got a package that will work. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=247.0s)]
*  As to what happened in Russia with Navalny, Navalny was one of the bravest people I ever met. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=250.0s)]
*  When he went back to Russia, he had to know he was going to be killed by Putin and he was murdered by Putin. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=255.0s)]
*  So why don't we do this? I just got off the phone with two Democratic senators. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=261.0s)]
*  Let's make Russia a state-sponsored terrorism under U.S. law. Let's make them pay a price for killing Navalny. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=265.0s)]
*  It would allow the Navalny family to go to U.S. court and sue Putin's Russia for killing of their loved one. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=271.0s)]
*  A state-sponsored terrorism designation is a game changer. It would allow more sanctions. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=277.0s)]
*  It would open up the American courtroom. I've been pushing this for a year. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=282.0s)]
*  Do you expect legislation on that this week? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=285.0s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. President Biden told Putin, if something happens to Navalny, you're going to pay a price. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=288.0s)]
*  President Biden, I agree with you. The price they should pay is to make Russia a state-sponsored terrorism like Iran, Cuba and North Korea. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=294.0s)]
*  They deserve this designation. Putin's been killing people, opposition leaders for decades now. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=303.0s)]
*  He's dismembered Syria. He's one of the world's worst actors. He's an indicted war criminal. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=309.0s)]
*  I want to come back to what you said about this news you just made, that you're now supporting House legislation on Ukraine funding after opposing the Senate legislation. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=315.0s)]
*  You said you think you can get former President Trump to buy in on some components. That's a big guess. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=324.0s)]
*  Have you spoken to former President Trump about your new support for this House bill? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=330.0s)]
*  And are you confident you can convince him to not try to kill what Brian Fitzpatrick, the House member from Pennsylvania, is putting forward? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=335.0s)]
*  Good question. I have not spoken to President Trump about this package. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=344.0s)]
*  I spoke to President Trump earlier in the week about making the aid to Ukraine a loan. This was his idea, not mine. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=348.0s)]
*  You know, we did lend leased to Britain. We're $34 trillion in debt. Ukraine has minerals. They have a lot of resources. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=356.0s)]
*  Israel has a strong economy. They've been hurt badly by October the 7th. Taiwan is a pretty rich nation. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=364.0s)]
*  Why don't we do this? Make a favorable loan to all three of these allies. Let them pass back when they can, if they can, because we're $34 trillion in debt. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=371.0s)]
*  That's the Trump idea. If you embrace that, I think you'll get a lot of votes in the House and the Senate. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=381.0s)]
*  President Trump says let's wait on the border. With all due respect, we cannot wait. It's a national security nightmare. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=387.0s)]
*  I think we're going to see a 2,000% increase in people on the terrorist watch list coming across the border in two years. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=394.0s)]
*  Five billion people could be killed by the amount of fentanyl coming across our southern border. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=401.0s)]
*  The largest loss of life of young people in America is fentanyl poisoning coming across the southern border. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=406.0s)]
*  So I don't want to wait. I want to act now on the border. I want to turn the aid package into a loan. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=412.0s)]
*  That makes perfect sense to me. I think the bipartisan problem solvers group has an idea that will sell. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=417.0s)]
*  So if you're Putin, I want you to know we're not going to pull the plug on Ukraine. We're going to come after you. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=425.0s)]
*  We're going to make your country a state sponsor of terrorism. You're going to pay a heavy price for murdering this brave man. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=432.0s)]
*  But Putin's watching what's happening in Congress, and he must wonder where is the Republican Party these days? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=438.0s)]
*  Former President Trump has been invited by President Zelensky to come to the front lines. Should he do that? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=444.0s)]
*  And do you have any concern, Senator Graham, with how former President Trump has spoken about NATO allies [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=449.0s)]
*  and how he has said if they're delinquent on payments to NATO, well, Russia can do whatever the heck it wants? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=455.0s)]
*  Is that appropriate, especially in terms of U.S. foreign policy? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=461.0s)]
*  I think what's appropriate is for everybody to meet the obligation of 2%. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=465.0s)]
*  Sam Nunn in 1984 threatened to withdraw 30,000 troops a year from NATO if they didn't make the 3% number back in the 80s. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=471.0s)]
*  So here's what I think. They should pay up. 19 of 31 NATO nations do not contribute 2% of GDP. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=480.0s)]
*  I want to have a system where if you don't pay, you get kicked out. But no, I'm not inviting Russia to invade Ukraine. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=488.0s)]
*  President Trump is right to want NATO nations to meet their obligation of 2%. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=494.0s)]
*  We need to turn it into an obligation that means something. I'm a big fan of NATO. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=499.0s)]
*  But there's $70 billion, $80 billion left on the table. If you're in NATO, pay the 2%. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=505.0s)]
*  Final thing here, Senator Graham. Special Counsel Herr is scheduled to go before the House Judiciary Committee in the coming weeks. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=511.0s)]
*  You're on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Do you plan to push to have him testify before your committee? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=519.0s)]
*  We'll leave that up to Senator Durbin. I've got some ideas about that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=524.0s)]
*  But I just want to end it. One, thank you for having me on the show. I see a pathway forward now for Ukraine, Taiwan, and Israel. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=530.0s)]
*  I see a way to secure our border in a more simple fashion. Let's make Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=538.0s)]
*  All of this can happen in the next 30 days. It would be a game changer for the world. So we'll see what happens. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=544.0s)]
*  The talks seem dead. Now they seem alive. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, thank you. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYa4PQkZ4_o&t=551.0s)]
