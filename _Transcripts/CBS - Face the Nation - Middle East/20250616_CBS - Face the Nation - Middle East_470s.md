# Trump weighs in on Israel-Iran conflict, Putin getting kicked out of G7
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0)
*  Well, we have our cameras following President Trump's every move in Canada as he moves to the G7 summit for the year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=0.0s)]
*  Here is the President right now speaking to reporters with Prime Minister Mark Carney at his side. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=8.0s)]
*  We're going to come out with something, hopefully. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=14.0s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think a deal is achievable within days, within weeks? Is there that kind of runway? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=16.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's achievable. Both parties have to agree, yeah, sure. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=24.0s)]
*  Mr. President, on Iran, have you heard any signals or seen any messages from intermediaries that Iran wishes to de-escalate the conflict? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=28.0s)]
*  What have you heard from the Iranians? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=38.0s)]
*  They'd like to talk, but they should have done that before. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=41.0s)]
*  I had 60 days and they had 60 days, and on the 61st day I said, we don't have a deal. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=45.0s)]
*  They have to make a deal, and it's painful for both parties, but I'd say Iran is not winning this war. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=51.0s)]
*  And they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it's too late. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=59.0s)]
*  And what would you say, in your opinion, what would it take for the U.S. to get involved in this conflict militarily? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=63.0s)]
*  I don't want to talk about that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=69.0s)]
*  And you mentioned Putin. Do you think that he should have a seat at the G7 today, that it should be the G8? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=71.0s)]
*  I'm not saying he should at this point, because too much water has gone over the dam, maybe. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=77.0s)]
*  But it was a big mistake. Obama didn't want him, and the head of your country, the proud head of your country didn't want him. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=82.0s)]
*  This was a big mistake. You wouldn't have that war. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=91.0s)]
*  You know, you have your enemy at the table. Even, I don't even consider if he wasn't really an enemy at that time. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=94.0s)]
*  There was no concept. If I were president, this war would have never happened. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=100.0s)]
*  But likewise, if he were a member of what was called the G8 at that time, it was always the G8, you wouldn't have a war right now. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=104.0s)]
*  Why not? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=112.0s)]
*  What intelligence support are you providing Israel? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=113.0s)]
*  We've always supported Israel. We have for a long period of time, strongly. And Israel is doing very well right now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=118.0s)]
*  Why not have China at the G8? Why not have China here, the biggest economy in the world after the United States? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=125.0s)]
*  Well, it's not a bad idea. I don't mind that. If somebody wants to suggest China coming in, I think we suggest. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=131.0s)]
*  But you want to have people that you can talk to. You know, they don't talk to you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=136.0s)]
*  Putin speaks to me. He doesn't speak to anybody else. He doesn't want to talk to me. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=141.0s)]
*  Because he was very insulted when he got thrown out of the G8. As I would be, as you would be, as anybody would be. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=144.0s)]
*  He was very insulted. And I mean, he was thrown out by Trudeau, who convinced one or two people, along with Obama. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=150.0s)]
*  He was thrown out. And he's not a happy person about it, I can tell you that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=158.0s)]
*  He basically doesn't even speak to the people that throw him out. And I agree with him. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=164.0s)]
*  On the issue of immigration, why are you ordering ICE to target democratic inner cities? What's behind that? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=170.0s)]
*  I don't know what you're saying. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=179.0s)]
*  You did a post last night where you said you want ICE to really target democratic cities. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=180.0s)]
*  I want them to focus on the cities because the cities are where you really have what's called sanctuary cities. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=184.0s)]
*  And that's where the people are. I look at New York. I look at Chicago. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=189.0s)]
*  I mean, you got a really bad governor in Chicago and a bad mayor. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=193.0s)]
*  But the governor is probably the worst in the country, Pritzker. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=197.0s)]
*  But I look at how that city has been overrun by criminals. And, you know, New York and L.A., look at L.A. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=200.0s)]
*  L.A., those people weren't from L.A. They weren't from California. Most of those people, many of those people. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=207.0s)]
*  And, yeah, that's that's the focus. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=213.0s)]
*  Biden allowed 21 million people to come into our country. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=216.0s)]
*  Of that, vast numbers of those people were murderers, killers, people from gangs, people from jails. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=220.0s)]
*  They emptied their jails out into the U.S. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=228.0s)]
*  Most of those people are in the cities, all blue cities, all Democrat run cities. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=230.0s)]
*  And they think they're going to use them to vote. It's not going to happen. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=236.0s)]
*  If you don't mind, just I'm going to exercise my role, if you will, as G7 chair since we have a few more minutes with the president and his team. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=239.0s)]
*  And then we actually have to start the meeting to address some of these big issues. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=250.0s)]
*  So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=254.0s)]
*  That's it. That's it. Thank you very much. Out. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=259.0s)]
*  All right. You heard it. Out you go. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=264.0s)]
*  The press being ushered out with just a few remarks there. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=267.0s)]
*  But listening to all of it, CBS News White House correspondent Natalie Brand. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=270.0s)]
*  Natalie, I'm struck that Iran seemed to be what we heard at the very top of that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=274.0s)]
*  And it was very striking to me that President Trump with Prime Minister Carney standing next to him did not want to really talk about U.S. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=279.0s)]
*  involvement. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=286.0s)]
*  This, as we know, that Israel needs our bunker buster bombs with there to go deep in Iran to really take out those nuclear facilities. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=288.0s)]
*  Yeah, Reid, in this short question and answer period that we heard, the president was asked about some of the new reporting, including the reporting by the Wall Street Journal that Iran is sending signals or messages perhaps through intermediaries that are being sent to the country. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=297.0s)]
*  The president was asked about that and he said, yes, they would like to talk. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=312.0s)]
*  They should have come to the table and talk. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=317.0s)]
*  And he also said they are not winning this war. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=320.0s)]
*  But again, signaling that he wants them to come back to the negotiating table. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=324.0s)]
*  Then someone also asked, what would it take for the United States to get involved? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=328.0s)]
*  And he said he didn't want to talk about that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=333.0s)]
*  That doesn't mean that the U.S. is not going to talk about it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=336.0s)]
*  But he did say that they would be involved and he said he didn't want to talk about that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=339.0s)]
*  That does come after a weekend social media post in which he said that if Iran were to strike a U.S. asset that they would be met with force unlike they've seen before. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=342.0s)]
*  We also know from CBS News reporting and Olivia Gazza's reporting that the State Department through a cable has been sending the message to embassies to really emphasize the point that the U.S. was not directly involved in the Israeli strike on Iranian targets, which started this conflict late Thursday night into Friday morning. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=357.0s)]
*  So Iran and Israel certainly hanging over the G7 summit when, you know, ordinarily trade would probably be at the top of the agenda with the president's tariffs on all of these key trading partners. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=384.0s)]
*  Now, this pool spray, when reporters were allowed into the room, it was quite brief because it's Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney who's really controlling the timing of this as the host country. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=398.0s)]
*  But in very brief remarks, President Trump also noted that this used to be the G8 and that it was President Obama and Canada's former Prime Minister Trudeau that made the decision to kick out Russia following Russia's annexation of Crimea. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=410.0s)]
*  The president making the point that in his mind that was the wrong move and that there wouldn't be a war if that would have happened. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=429.0s)]
*  That if that wouldn't have happened, then again, as President Trump's claim, of course, the conflict, the war, Russia's war on Ukraine, another big topic at this summit this week. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=438.0s)]
*  All right. And really kind of got a sense of where President Trump is on China when he was asked about China not being at the table. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=449.0s)]
*  He really sort of said, look, we're having people who will talk to us and have conversations that may speak a lot as we see this 90 day tariff extensions continue to play out expires next month. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=455.0s)]
*  Natalie Brand, thank you so much for talking to us there from the White House lawn. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dp45eEqXw0&t=466.0s)]
