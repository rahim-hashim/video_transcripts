# Why the NAACP wants Biden to stop weapons shipments to Israel
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q)
*  The NAACP is calling on President Biden to halt all weapons deliveries to Israel and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=0.0s)]
*  to push for an immediate and permanent ceasefire. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=6.12s)]
*  The NAACP released a statement that read in part, quote, it is imperative that the violence [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=8.76s)]
*  that has claimed so many civilian lives immediately stop. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=14.22s)]
*  Amos must return the hostages and stop all terrorist activity. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=18.18s)]
*  Israel must commit to an offensive strategy that is aligned with international and humanitarian [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=22.52s)]
*  laws, unquote. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=28.7s)]
*  The president and CEO of the NAACP, Derek Johnson, is here with me now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=30.06s)]
*  Derek, it's great to see you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=34.18s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=35.18s)]
*  Walk us through the decision that the NAACP came to and why. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=36.7s)]
*  But we are seeing an increase in racial hate crimes here in America, whether it's racism, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=40.94s)]
*  anti-Semitic activities, or anti-Islamic phobia. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=46.22s)]
*  We recognize that what happened globally actually have an impact here domestically. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=50.82s)]
*  And as we approach the November elections, communities should be talking about how we [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=55.98s)]
*  can work together, not about the things that divide us. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=59.66s)]
*  And it's unfortunate that we are here at this juncture. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=62.86s)]
*  The president said last week in remarks at the White House that this war should end and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=66.53999999999999s)]
*  the new days should begin. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=70.58s)]
*  That's not enough. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=72.62s)]
*  But we absolutely agree. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=73.62s)]
*  And he calls for a ceasefire. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=75.02s)]
*  But calling for a ceasefire and then sending arms, that's inconsistent. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=77.14s)]
*  We support the right of Israel to defend itself, but we also have grave concerns with the high [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=82.42s)]
*  civilian casualty, particularly of kids. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=88.02000000000001s)]
*  And so as a nation, we must look at how is this going to impact November? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=91.54s)]
*  Our biggest fear that we have white supremacist sympathizers sitting in the White House, because [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=97.38000000000001s)]
*  the last administration, what happened in one week's time, the Latino community was [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=101.58000000000001s)]
*  attacked with a mass shooting at El Paso, Texas, at a Walmart. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=106.82000000000001s)]
*  The African-American community was attacked with a mass shooting at a Kroger in Louisville, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=110.18s)]
*  Kentucky. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=114.66000000000001s)]
*  And the very next night, a synagogue was attacked in Pittsburgh. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=115.66000000000001s)]
*  We cannot exist as a nation if we allow the very fabric of this nation to divide us as [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=119.18s)]
*  opposed to making sure that we stand up and ensure that civilians are not attacked and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=125.34s)]
*  communities are safe here domestically. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=130.38s)]
*  Derek, for those who might hear this request from the NAACP and think, well, that's separating [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=132.66s)]
*  that very large and powerful organization from President Biden on a matter of policy [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=138.17999999999998s)]
*  that might discourage black turnout for President Biden, that might harm him politically. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=142.66s)]
*  How would you address that inference being drawn? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=146.89999999999998s)]
*  Well, we are not a spokes organization for the president or any administration. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=150.17999999999998s)]
*  We are nonpartisan and we don't support candidates, but we also recognize the dire nature that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=153.89999999999998s)]
*  we are confronted with our democracy. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=159.7s)]
*  The choice in November up and down the ballot isn't whether or not we have candidate A or [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=162.14s)]
*  candidate B. It's whether or not we have a functioning democracy or something less than [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=166.9s)]
*  that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=170.94000000000003s)]
*  And if we get something less than that, all of our communities could be under attack, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=171.94000000000003s)]
*  especially African Americans, the Jewish community and the Islamic community. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  And in this moment, we need to look at ways we can get peace in Gaza, peace in the Congo, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=179.22000000000003s)]
*  so we can begin to focus domestically on what's important. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=185.06s)]
*  Has the NAACP reached any conclusions as this is being debated at the International Criminal [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=188.78000000000003s)]
*  Court as to whether or not Israel has engaged in something that could be alleged or confirmed [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=193.7s)]
*  to be war crimes? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=198.94s)]
*  But that's not our role. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  We support the president's call for a ceasefire. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=201.38s)]
*  We believe there should be de-escalation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=204.42s)]
*  And how do you get there? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=206.57999999999998s)]
*  You stop the arms and you force people to the tables to have true and meaningful conversations [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=207.89999999999998s)]
*  so that we can get to a different space in that region of the world. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=213.38s)]
*  And when the Israeli government led by Benjamin Netanyahu says, we cannot have those kinds [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  of conversations, we've been trying to have those conversations with Hamas because they [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=221.85999999999999s)]
*  are a terrorist organization, bent, according to their own words, on the destruction of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  Israel, we have to eradicate Hamas in order to have a new future for Gaza, you would say [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=230.42s)]
*  what? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=235.78s)]
*  Well, for Netanyahu, we see him no different than Hamas, and that's the problem. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=236.78s)]
*  You do not. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=240.42s)]
*  We don't see him any different. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=241.42s)]
*  We support the people of Israel. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=242.62s)]
*  We support individuals who seek peace. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=244.1s)]
*  And unfortunately, he's operating in the same vein as any other fascist would operate. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=246.58s)]
*  And that's unfortunate. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=252.68s)]
*  We should be looking at a way forward in peace and not so many civilian children's lives. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=254.18s)]
*  What we're seeing now is undermining the very goal of having a president of the Middle [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=260.78000000000003s)]
*  East in a way in which everyone can really exist right now under that regime that's not [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=265.98s)]
*  happening. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=271.66s)]
*  Derek Johnson, NAACP, thank you very much for your time. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4SAVhtPC6Q&t=272.66s)]
