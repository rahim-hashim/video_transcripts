# U.S. working to verify reports of Americans dead or taken hostage in Israel, Antony Blinken says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w)
*  We go now to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who joins us from the State Department here [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=0.0s)]
*  in Washington. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=4.92s)]
*  Good to have you with us, Mr. Secretary. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=5.92s)]
*  I know you have been working straight through on this. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=8.64s)]
*  Can you answer the question yet of whether the Hamas assault is over? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Are there more attacks to come? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=17.32s)]
*  The assault isn't over. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=20.36s)]
*  They're continuing to be very active fighting around Gaza. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=21.36s)]
*  At the same time, we've seen more quiet in other parts of Israel, but there is intense [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=26.48s)]
*  fighting going on. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  And what about Americans? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=31.48s)]
*  There are a lot throughout the region. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=33.28s)]
*  How many Americans are among the hostages and among the dead? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=35.34s)]
*  So Margaret, we've got reports that several Americans are among the dead. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=38.96s)]
*  We're working very actively to verify those reports. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=43.64s)]
*  At the same time, the reports of Americans being taken hostage, there too, we're working [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=46.3s)]
*  to get the facts and to find out if those reports are accurate. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=51.38s)]
*  So you don't know if there are hostages or not? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=54.52s)]
*  We can't confirm that in this moment, but we're very actively working to see if we can [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=58.64s)]
*  confirm the reports that we've had. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  Has the United States asked Israel not to strike Iran? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=65.14s)]
*  The only things we've said to Israel are that we're here, we've got your back, we want to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  make sure that you have the support that you need, we want to make sure that you have the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=74.0s)]
*  assistance that you need. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=76.92s)]
*  At the same time, I was on the phone yesterday and many others were on the phones yesterday [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=78.14s)]
*  with counterparts from Egypt, from Saudi Arabia, from Jordan, from Qatar, from the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=81.12s)]
*  United Arab Emirates, from Turkey, Lebanon, and many European countries as well, to make [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=87.4s)]
*  sure that, first of all, people have heard very clearly what the president said about [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  others in other places not taking advantage of the situation, and to use the influence [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=97.68s)]
*  that they have with different groups to make sure that they don't do that, precisely so [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  that we don't have a broadening of this conflict to other places. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=106.86s)]
*  But the door is open for Israel to expand this, to take the fight to potentially sponsors [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=111.53999999999999s)]
*  of Hamas like Iran? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=118.16s)]
*  Israel is focused entirely on Gaza and on securing its citizens, a number of whom remain [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=120.82s)]
*  under direct threat right now in Israel proper, and as I said, trying to do what's necessary [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=129.5s)]
*  to have accountability and to make sure that this doesn't happen again. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=135.42s)]
*  That is Israel's focus. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=138.66s)]
*  Is there a sense that this was an attempt to take advantage of the West's focus on Ukraine? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=140.42s)]
*  No, I don't see that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=147.42s)]
*  I think, look, we'll have to see as we learn more what the motivations were and what they [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=149.38s)]
*  are. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=157.34s)]
*  But here's one thing that's clear. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=158.34s)]
*  We've been actively working on trying to help Israel and Saudi Arabia normalize their relations, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=160.98s)]
*  as well as Israel broadening its relationships with many other countries in the region and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=165.84s)]
*  beyond. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=170.42s)]
*  Very hard work and not clear that we could get there, but if we could, it would really [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=171.42s)]
*  change the prospects of the entire region far into the future. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  Now who's opposed to that? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=179.54s)]
*  Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=181.82s)]
*  So I think that speaks volumes. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=185.33999999999997s)]
*  And there are really two paths before the region. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=186.5s)]
*  There's the path of greater integration, greater stability, including, critically, making sure [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=188.78s)]
*  that Israelis and Palestinians resolve their differences. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=193.26s)]
*  Or there's the path of terror that Hamas is engaged on that has not improved the lives [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=195.86s)]
*  of a single person. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=199.58s)]
*  On the contrary, it's destroyed lives, including Palestinian lives. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=200.58s)]
*  But let me press you on that because you're suggesting this may have been a strategic [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=203.34s)]
*  choice. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=208.02s)]
*  But then I look at conditions having been deteriorating for Palestinians living in the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=209.3s)]
*  West Bank and Gaza for a while now. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=213.7s)]
*  The right-wing coalition in Israel, in fact, the CIA director, Bill Burns, has publicly [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=216.58s)]
*  warned of his concern and U.S. intelligence concern about the risk of instability in this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=220.9s)]
*  region. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=227.02s)]
*  Jordan's King has been warning about the risk of extremism. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=228.02s)]
*  Did the Netanyahu government underestimate that risk? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=231.94s)]
*  Why were they so vulnerable? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  First, let's be absolutely clear that there is no equivalence between the differences [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=238.62s)]
*  that exist between Israelis and Palestinians and the actions of the Israeli government [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=246.74s)]
*  in that regard and these absolutely heinous acts of terrorism that we've seen directed [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=251.94000000000003s)]
*  at Israeli men, women and children. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=257.90000000000003s)]
*  None. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=261.34000000000003s)]
*  We have been concerned about the risks of instability for many, many months between [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=262.41999999999996s)]
*  Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=269.61999999999995s)]
*  We've said from day one that even as we're working toward normalization between Israel [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=270.9s)]
*  and Saudi Arabia, that can't be a substitute for resolving the differences between Israelis [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=274.53999999999996s)]
*  and Palestinians. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=279.12s)]
*  We think the best way to resolve it remains a two-state solution and one that ensures [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=280.12s)]
*  that Palestinians and Israelis alike know equal measures of democracy, of opportunity, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=283.82s)]
*  of dignity in their lives. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=288.62s)]
*  That's why we've been very focused on that track as well. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=290.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  But that has not been a priority between the parties themselves. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=295.21999999999997s)]
*  But as you know, Gaza, and I'm explaining this to our audience because I know you know [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=299.74s)]
*  how concentrated the population is within such a small area. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=304.78s)]
*  And every time we have a conflict like this, it raises the question of what the humanitarian [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=308.92s)]
*  impact will be. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=314.62s)]
*  If this is a prolonged attack, what kind of humanitarian crisis are you expecting here [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=316.76s)]
*  and impact on civilians? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=323.56s)]
*  Well, we've seen this unfortunately repeat itself, although the magnitude, the scale [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=325.56s)]
*  of what Hamas did here is something we haven't seen before. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=332.4s)]
*  But in prior instances, those who have suffered along with the victims of terrorism are civilians, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=335.5s)]
*  including in Gaza. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=345.04s)]
*  And whatever Israel does in Gaza, as always, we look to it to do everything possible to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=346.66s)]
*  avoid civilian casualties, something of course that Hamas doesn't do. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=353.38s)]
*  On the contrary, not only does it not seek to avoid them, it deliberately targets civilians. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=356.26000000000005s)]
*  It's gunning down Israelis in the streets, in their homes, and as I said, dragging them [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=360.70000000000005s)]
*  across the border in Gaza. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=364.26s)]
*  So there's absolutely no comparison. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=365.82000000000005s)]
*  But we look to Israel as always to apply the highest standards when it comes to avoiding [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=369.38s)]
*  civilian casualties in anything it may do in Gaza. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=375.1s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time this morning. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=377.56s)]
*  Thanks Margaret. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=381.48s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XulNLHvj30w&t=382.48s)]
