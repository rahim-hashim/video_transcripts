# Trump says Israel and Iran are tired of war, signals confidence about ceasefire
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo)
*  We're joined now byâ€”with John Alterman from the Center for Strategic and International [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=0.0s)]
*  Studies to discuss more of this. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=5.36s)]
*  John, it's great to see you here on set. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=7.24s)]
*  Thank you, Kevin. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=8.24s)]
*  I want to play a little bit about what the president said today when he was asked how [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=9.24s)]
*  confident he is that this ceasefire between Iran and Israel is at this point. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=18.6s)]
*  I think they both fired at him. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=19.6s)]
*  I think they don't want it to happen again. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=20.6s)]
*  And Iran's not going to have a nuclear weapon, by the way. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=21.6s)]
*  I think it's the last thing they're going to do. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=22.6s)]
*  So what's your assessment? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=23.6s)]
*  Are they tired of it? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=34.64s)]
*  What should we make of what we've seen today? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=36.54s)]
*  You know, Kaylan, I'm not sure they're tired of it, but from an Israeli perspective, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=38.68s)]
*  they got not only what they wanted in the near term, they got what Israeli governments [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=43.96s)]
*  have wanted for more than a decade for the United States to take out this Fordow nuclear [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=47.56s)]
*  facility, which only the U.S. has the capability to do. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=53.64s)]
*  The U.S. did it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  And by the way, it didn't start a war. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=58.919999999999995s)]
*  So from an Israeli perspective, mission accomplished. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=61.16s)]
*  From an Iranian perspective, they can't fight a conventional war against the United States [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=64.36s)]
*  and Israel. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=69.56s)]
*  The Iranians can negotiate. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=70.92s)]
*  They can do their asymmetrical things like terrorism and cyber and supporting proxy groups. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  But to stay involved in a conventional military battle, they keep losing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=78.52s)]
*  So I think the Iranians decided, let's get out of this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=84.64s)]
*  The Israelis decided, we're done. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  Let's move on. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=90.52s)]
*  And both sides had President Trump pushing them and said, OK, we'll do it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=91.52s)]
*  Well, so that's interesting, because I think we were wondering how quickly this came together. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=95.12s)]
*  I mean, when we got off air, minutes after we got off air, this ceasefire was announced [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=98.92s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=103.84s)]
*  Is that typical for these types of things, for that to come together so quickly? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=106.0s)]
*  Or was it just that all of these pressures were mounting? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=110.12s)]
*  Again, I think every side thought enough. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=113.24s)]
*  I think the president was forceful and people had confidence that if the president said [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=117.52s)]
*  it, the Israelis would follow through, the Iranians would follow through. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  So it was a combination of both the circumstance and having an American president who seemed [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=128.24s)]
*  to really care about moving this forward. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=133.8s)]
*  What was interesting yesterday was that there was talk of de-escalation after what I think [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=136.76s)]
*  most people would look at and say, wait, that feels like it's escalating with missiles being [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=142.2s)]
*  fired and retaliatory strikes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=147.36s)]
*  How is it that we've gotten to this point that it feels like things may be on their [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=150.48s)]
*  way to some kind of de-escalation? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=157.24s)]
*  Again, I think if you look at everybody's interests, everybody's interests are in trying [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=159.76s)]
*  to back down. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=164.88s)]
*  Where this goes in the longer term, I think, is a concern. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=166.04s)]
*  I think we all remember President Bush standing with a mission accomplished sign in Iraq. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=170.76s)]
*  The danger is that rather than slowing an Iranian nuclear bomb, this attack actually [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=175.76s)]
*  accelerates the development of Iranian nuclear bomb. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=181.72s)]
*  They decide they'll withdraw from the nonproliferation treaty. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=184.8s)]
*  It's harder to get insight to what they're doing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=187.84s)]
*  They surprise the world with nuclear device. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  We could be in that world in two or three years. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=192.0s)]
*  I think the important thing now is that the military action is followed up with successful [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  diplomatic action to get the Iranians to abandon the nuclear program. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  They haven't said they will. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  And I don't see any sign yet that they intend to. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  But can you use the circumstance we're in now to move them in that direction? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=211.56s)]
*  That's the diplomatic challenge that the White House faces right now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=215.8s)]
*  Just quickly on that point, it seems from what you're describing that Iran is in such [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=219.08s)]
*  a weakened state that they are essentially being forced into the negotiation table. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=223.08s)]
*  What do they have at this point working for them? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  They have, what they want is they want relief from sanctions and they want to stop fighting [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=233.72000000000003s)]
*  a war. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=239.12s)]
*  What they have is they have a nuclear weapons program they can bargain away and their ability [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  to do all the mischief that they've done in the Middle East and around the world using [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=245.08s)]
*  these asymmetrical tools. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  Basically we're trying to get them to stop misbehaving. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=251.32000000000002s)]
*  And I think the question in their mind is will we get what we want? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  The real question also is will they actually give up the nuclear program? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=261.36s)]
*  How long will they try to drag this out? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=265.68s)]
*  Whose patients will run out first? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=268.76s)]
*  And that's something we're going to have to watch in not only the months to come but [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=270.52000000000004s)]
*  in the years to come. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=273.8s)]
*  Absolutely something that we'll hover over this administration certainly. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  John, thank you so much for your time. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=278.64s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=280.32s)]
*  Thank you, Kaylee. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KhQjHVEKo&t=281.32s)]
