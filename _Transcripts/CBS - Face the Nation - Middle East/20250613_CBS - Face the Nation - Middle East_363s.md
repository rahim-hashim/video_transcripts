# Netanyahu makes appeal to people of Iran in video statement
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes)
*  And we're following more developments in this story, including out of Israel, Prime Minister [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=0.0s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, in a recent address, he spoke to the people of Iran. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=6.16s)]
*  We pulled a clip of what he had to say. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  We want you to listen to it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=16.78s)]
*  Tonight, I wish to speak to you, the proud people of Iran. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=18.28s)]
*  We're in the midst of one of the greatest military operations in history, Operation [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=22.56s)]
*  Rising Lion. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=28.76s)]
*  The Islamic regime, which has oppressed you for nearly 50 years, threatens to destroy [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=30.68s)]
*  my country, the State of Israel. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=35.28s)]
*  The objective of Israel's military operation is to remove this threat, both the nuclear [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=38.300000000000004s)]
*  threat and the ballistic missile threat to Israel. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=43.92s)]
*  And as we achieve our objectives, we're also clearing the path for you to achieve your [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=47.88s)]
*  objective, which is freedom. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  In the past 24 hours, we've taken out top military commanders, senior nuclear scientists, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=57.14s)]
*  the Islamic regime's most significant enrichment facility, and a large portion of its ballistic [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=63.54s)]
*  missile arsenal. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=69.9s)]
*  More is on the way. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=71.94s)]
*  The regime doesn't know what hit them. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=74.02s)]
*  They don't know what will hit them. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=76.88s)]
*  The nation of Iran and the nation of Israel have been true friends since the days of Cyrus [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=79.3s)]
*  the Great. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=84.78s)]
*  And the time has come for you to unite around your flag and your stark legacy by standing [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=85.78s)]
*  up for your freedom from an evil and oppressive regime. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=93.52s)]
*  It has never been weaker. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=98.64s)]
*  This is your opportunity to stand up and let your voices be heard. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=100.82s)]
*  Woman, life, freedom. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=105.34s)]
*  Zan, zandegi, azadi. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=108.14s)]
*  As I said yesterday and many times before, Israel's fight is not with you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=112.42s)]
*  It's not with you, the brave people of Iran, whom we respect and admire. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=118.06s)]
*  Our fight is with our common enemy, a murderous regime that both oppresses you and impoverishes [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=124.1s)]
*  you. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=131.94s)]
*  Brave people of Iran, your light will defeat the darkness. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=133.46s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=138.38s)]
*  The people of Israel are with you. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=140.02s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=142.42000000000002s)]
*  So, once again, you heard Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel addressing in an interesting [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=143.42000000000002s)]
*  twist, addressing the people directly of Iran, saying that the fight is not with the Iranian [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=150.82000000000002s)]
*  people, but rather the regime. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=159.54000000000002s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News Middle East reporter Courtney Keighley, who is here with me in [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=162.14000000000001s)]
*  Studio 57. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=167.06s)]
*  Courtney, you have been covering this region for so long. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=169.02s)]
*  How unique is it that the Israeli Prime Minister would directly speak to the Iranian people? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=175.46s)]
*  How do you square this message that this war is not with the Iranian people, but rather [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  with the regime, when missiles rained down on densely populated areas of Iran just in [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=191.3s)]
*  the last 24 hours? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=198.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=199.42s)]
*  And the thing is, as a source told me, who's been covering Iran since the revolution of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=200.42s)]
*  1979, so I'll defer to him. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=206.17999999999998s)]
*  He said to me, you know, the Iranians are anti-regime, but they're also nationalistic. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=209.77999999999997s)]
*  You're pummeling their country. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=216.33999999999997s)]
*  Would that drive them into the arms of the regime? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=219.01999999999998s)]
*  Doubtful into the arms of regime, but not necessarily listening to Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=221.38s)]
*  who are having any truck with the Israelis who are bombing them. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=226.26000000000002s)]
*  So Netanyahu can speak to them and speak to their movement for women's rights and their [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=229.58s)]
*  movement for human rights, but I don't think that's going to sit well with normal Iranians. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=234.26000000000002s)]
*  Right now what we're hearing from Iran is that there are many anti-regime protests, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=239.46s)]
*  but we also saw protests in the thousands waving the Iranian flags and in support of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=244.86s)]
*  Iran and the regime. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=252.42000000000002s)]
*  So the question is right now, who will prevail? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=254.18s)]
*  And it seems like the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is still in power. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=257.66s)]
*  Top military leadership under the Supreme Leader has been taken out. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=262.5s)]
*  Ballistic missile depots, rocket depots, Mossad had drones launched all over the country. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  They were already in place and smuggled those in over a long period of time. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=272.38s)]
*  Israel has been saying this could happen for a very long time. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=277.3s)]
*  It happened on day 61, past the 60 days that President Trump had given the Iranians to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=280.98s)]
*  come to a deal. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=287.42s)]
*  President Trump seems like he still wants a deal. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=289.42s)]
*  Saudi Arabia has been on the phone, the Crown Prince, with President Trump recently. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=292.18s)]
*  Will cooler heads prevail? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=298.56s)]
*  We're seeing ballistic missile attacks over Israel and some getting through, light to [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=299.86s)]
*  moderate injuries. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=304.34000000000003s)]
*  We're seeing civilians being killed inside Iran with those attacks ongoing. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=305.7s)]
*  And it looks like Prime Minister Netanyahu, while speaking to the Iranian public, is still [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=311.5s)]
*  going to go as far as he can in favor for Israelis and what they see and what he has [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=315.82s)]
*  seen most importantly as an existential threat for a very long time. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=321.85999999999996s)]
*  And to your point of the Iranian people, they are a people who take great pride in their [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=326.17999999999995s)]
*  country, a people who take great pride in their heritage. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=333.1s)]
*  That was something that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at least attempted to speak to while [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=335.78000000000003s)]
*  in this late night address was pulling on their robust heritage to try to break through [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=342.98s)]
*  to the Iranian people. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=351.42s)]
*  Only time will tell if that actually does in fact happen. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=352.78000000000003s)]
*  Courtney Keely, I want to thank you for your expertise. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JUPxI8Mpes&t=358.5s)]
