# Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been a "difficult partner," Sen. Chris Coons says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [December 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM)
*  We go now to Democratic Senator Chris Coons, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=0.0s)]
*  who joins us from Wilmington, Delaware. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=2.44s)]
*  Good morning to you, Senator. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=4.88s)]
*  Good morning, Margaret. Great to be on with you again. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=6.94s)]
*  Thank you. As you know, there are ongoing talks [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  about changing not just border security funding, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=12.02s)]
*  but also policy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=15.46s)]
*  And from what we are reporting, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=17.86s)]
*  those two elements in particular, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=19.72s)]
*  raising the credible fear standard on asylum [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  and expanding detention and deportation efforts, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=24.8s)]
*  some in the Democratic caucus are objecting. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=29.06s)]
*  Are you okay with it? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=32.3s)]
*  Well, I need to know the final deals, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=34.94s)]
*  but I am likely to support this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=36.6s)]
*  I have spoken with a number of the negotiators. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=39.18s)]
*  They have been working hard this weekend. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=41.4s)]
*  I am hopeful that we can reach a conclusion [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=43.44s)]
*  this coming week. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=46.22s)]
*  Margaret, for us to fail to come together [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  and support Ukraine in their ongoing fight [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=50.28s)]
*  for freedom against Russian aggression [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=53.08s)]
*  would be a huge gift to Vladimir Putin [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=55.08s)]
*  and Xi Jinping and Hamas. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=57.56s)]
*  There's a lot of other things in this funding package [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=59.46s)]
*  that I strongly support, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=62.260000000000005s)]
*  interdicting fentanyl at our border, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=64.5s)]
*  strengthening border security, humanitarian relief, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=66.7s)]
*  aid to our Indo-Pacific partners, support for Israel. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=70.38s)]
*  So frankly, if we can come together [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=73.84s)]
*  on a border security deal that gets bipartisan support, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=76.48s)]
*  I will support it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=79.72s)]
*  But some of your fellow Democrats like Bob Menendez [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=81.04s)]
*  have said it's shameful [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=82.78s)]
*  and selling out migrants and asylum seekers. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=84.58s)]
*  Why is he wrong? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=87.53999999999999s)]
*  I understand Senator Menendez's passion [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=90.12s)]
*  on the part of making sure that our immigration system [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=92.66s)]
*  is safe, legal, and humane. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=96.02s)]
*  But as I've often said in talking about the campaign for 24, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=98.72s)]
*  President Biden needs to be compared not to the Almighty, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=103.5s)]
*  not to a perfect alternative, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=106.66s)]
*  but to the actual alternative. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=108.5s)]
*  And you just played for Congressman Gonzalez, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=110.24s)]
*  the stunning, hateful, fascist rhetoric [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=113.16s)]
*  of former President Trump [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=116.44s)]
*  when he's talking about poisoning the blood of our nation. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=117.74s)]
*  The former president would bring in place [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=121.08s)]
*  not these modest changes to asylum policy, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=123.48s)]
*  but radical and dramatic changes to immigration policy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=126.94s)]
*  We need to take seriously [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=130.56s)]
*  that there is a border security crisis, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=132.06s)]
*  and we need to take responsible steps [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=134.58s)]
*  that reflect our values. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=136.56s)]
*  And that requires more conversation [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=137.86s)]
*  to be had on the other side of this break, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  so please stay with us. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=141.26s)]
*  We'll have more with Senator Coons. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=142.28s)]
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=146.88s)]
*  Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons is back with us. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  Senator, I want to pick up where we left off. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=152.62s)]
*  We're talking about some potentially tough votes [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=155.29999999999998s)]
*  that will have to be taken in the near term [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=158.26s)]
*  with the border with Ukraine, with Israel, and Taiwan, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=160.7s)]
*  all of those bundled together. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  Was it a strategic mistake for the White House [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  to suggest bundling all of those [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=168.04s)]
*  as the president did in that Oval Office address [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=170.4s)]
*  when he asked for this big national security supplemental? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=172.54s)]
*  No, Margaret, I think we're at a moment [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=176.6s)]
*  where all around the world, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=178.38s)]
*  our partners and allies need to see that we are strong. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=179.92s)]
*  President Biden's done a remarkable job [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=183.34s)]
*  of pulling together a global coalition of 50 countries [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=185.42s)]
*  who in combination have contributed [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=189.48s)]
*  more to Ukraine's defense than we have, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  and making sure that we're pushing back on China [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=194.46s)]
*  and their predatory actions in the Indo-Pacific [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=198.12s)]
*  is a key part of our national security. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=200.98s)]
*  That there's also humanitarian relief in this package, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=203.46s)]
*  critical to address the hunger that's been caused [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=207.01999999999998s)]
*  by Russia's invasion of Ukraine [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=209.66s)]
*  and to come to the aid of Israel [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=211.7s)]
*  and to provide critically needed support [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=214.1s)]
*  for innocent Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=216.1s)]
*  To put all of this into one package recognizes [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  that it's urgent that we provide a signal to the world [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=221.74s)]
*  that we are still a reliable ally and partner. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=224.94s)]
*  Specific to Israel, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=229.14s)]
*  there was a pretty strong signal sent last night [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=231.92s)]
*  by Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  when he answered questions from reporters. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=236.32s)]
*  And he said he's quote, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=238.96s)]
*  "'Proud he prevented the establishment [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=240.2s)]
*  of a Palestinian state, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=242.3s)]
*  and he took credit for putting the brakes [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=243.46s)]
*  on the peace process.'" [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=245.7s)]
*  He seemed to be referring to President Biden's vision [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=247.3s)]
*  for revamped Palestinian authority [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=251.54s)]
*  when he said, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=253.68s)]
*  "'Among friends, it's important not to foster illusions.'" [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=254.74s)]
*  That seems to be casting the president's vision as deluded. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=260.08s)]
*  Is that acceptable from an ally [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=265.0s)]
*  who's asking for billions of dollars in aid? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=266.62s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=270.4s)]
*  has been an exceptionally difficult partner. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=271.64s)]
*  And I think President Biden did the right thing [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=274.46000000000004s)]
*  right after the shattering, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=277.04s)]
*  the horrific attack by Hamas to go to Israel, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  to stand strong with Israel, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=282.54s)]
*  and frankly, to send a firm message to Iran [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=284.58000000000004s)]
*  to stay out of this conflict. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=288.04s)]
*  He deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups to the region [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=289.92s)]
*  so that Israel could focus on its self-defense [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=293.88s)]
*  against Hamas and not face an open attack [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  from Hezbollah on the north or Houthis on the south, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=300.26s)]
*  or Iranian forces up on the Golan Heights. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=303.12s)]
*  What has been a real challenge is the big gap [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=306.8s)]
*  between most of us in Congress and the president [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=309.6s)]
*  who believe a two-state solution is the only way forward [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=312.86s)]
*  and Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=316.34000000000003s)]
*  who has done everything he can [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  to undermine a positive vision for peace for Israel. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=319.90000000000003s)]
*  So you have leverage here, though, policy-wise. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=323.58000000000004s)]
*  I mean, the president has been very vocal [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=326.98s)]
*  in defending the prime minister and his choices, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=330.52000000000004s)]
*  but President Biden did say the bombing is indiscriminate. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=334.48s)]
*  The U.S. provides billions of dollars, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=338.82s)]
*  like three billion or more a year. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=342.16s)]
*  We're looking at another 10. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=344.2s)]
*  Can't you put in some kind of provision here [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=346.3s)]
*  to force adherence to international law or U.S. law [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=348.8s)]
*  as Senator Van Hollen is proposing? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=352.64s)]
*  Margaret, there already are requirements in American law [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  that when we send military assistance to another country, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=359.58000000000004s)]
*  whether it's Ukraine or it's Israel, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=362.68s)]
*  that they have to abide by international law. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=365.32s)]
*  And President Biden and the senior members of his team [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=368.0s)]
*  who've gone to Israel repeatedly have had some success [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  in pressing Prime Minister Netanyahu to change direction, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=374.94s)]
*  most recently in reigning in settler violence [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=378.14000000000004s)]
*  in the West Bank. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=380.72s)]
*  Because of elements of Netanyahu's cabinet, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=381.92s)]
*  folks like Smotrich and Ben Govier, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokSzJFzHEM&t=384.96000000000004s)]
