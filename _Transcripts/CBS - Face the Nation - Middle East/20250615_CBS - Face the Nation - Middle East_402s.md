# Graham, Blumenthal discuss strikes between Israel and Iran, Iran's nuclear program
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po)
*  Starting here on the Middle East, Senator Graham, you said you believe it's in America's interest to go all in to help Israel finish the job. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=0.0s)]
*  It sounds like you mean offensive support. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=7.44s)]
*  So the worst possible outcome for the world is for the Iranian nuclear program to survive after all this. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=10.64s)]
*  How do you destroy their program? Through diplomacy? I prefer that. Or through military action. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=18.18s)]
*  If diplomacy is not successful and we live with the option of force, I would urge President Trump to go all in to make sure that when this operation is over, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=24.48s)]
*  there's nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program. If that means providing bombs, provide bombs, if that means flying— [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=35.92s)]
*  Bunker and busting bombs? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  If it means flying with Israel, fly with Israel. The worst possible outcome for the world is to take the Iranian nuclear program on and leave it standing. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=47.48s)]
*  That will be a disaster. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  Senator Blumenthal, what's your view? How involved should the U.S. get? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  Let's begin with the basic proposition that ought to motivate American policy as well as the world's. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=63.92s)]
*  A nuclear-armed Iran is an unacceptable threat to the world, not just to Israel, but to the United States as well. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=70.72s)]
*  And I support Israel's right to defend itself against this existential menace. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=79.72s)]
*  I'm very concerned right now about United States personnel in the region, our servicemen and women, but also the civilians that are there. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=84.72s)]
*  I'm getting phone calls from families in Connecticut who are deeply worried about their children who were there, about the hostage families. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=94.44s)]
*  I support the president's effort to prioritize diplomacy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=102.44s)]
*  Senator Blumenthal, before we get to Ukraine, I just want to tie up the Middle East here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=107.44s)]
*  You know, the defense secretary was testifying to Congress this week, and he said he's moved equipment meant to counter drones in Ukraine over to the Middle East now [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=111.44s)]
*  because of this escalation. What more is needed to protect U.S. personnel? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=122.36s)]
*  We need to move assets, and we've done so not only to protect U.S. personnel, but also to enable Israel to defend itself against Iran's retaliation. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=127.36s)]
*  But I think that the president is right to try to bring the two sides together. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=140.36s)]
*  I think it's a real deal that's possible here if Iran were to abandon its effort to build nuclear bombs that endanger not only Israel, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=146.28s)]
*  but the entire regional stability because all the other Arab nations are going to have nuclear weapons if Iran does as well. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=156.28s)]
*  But Americans have no interest in a forever war. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=166.28000000000003s)]
*  So I think we need to be mindful about the priority of diplomacy here and bring the two sides together as well as protecting U.S. personnel. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=170.2s)]
*  Senator Grim, the thing with diplomacy is that the Israeli prime minister is calling for the Iranian people to rise up against the regime, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=179.2s)]
*  a regime he says is calling for the destruction of his state. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=187.2s)]
*  It doesn't really seem like there's a compromise there if it's truly this existential. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=190.2s)]
*  Is this just leading us towards the outcome you say, which is the United States getting involved in military conflict? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=197.11999999999998s)]
*  Well, this is what I would love for the regime to fall. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=202.11999999999998s)]
*  If you don't, if you want this regime to stay in power, you're wanting people to oppress the Iranian people. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  You want people to threaten their neighbors to be the largest states. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=212.11999999999998s)]
*  Who wants the largest state sponsor of terrorism to stay in place? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=217.12s)]
*  But regime change is not the policy of the United States. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=220.12s)]
*  It is not the purpose of this attack yet. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=225.04s)]
*  But if there is one attack on an American anywhere in the Mideast by Iran, then you'll get regime change. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=228.04s)]
*  So what are we dealing with? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=234.04s)]
*  We're dealing with a non-negotiable part of the deal. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=236.04s)]
*  They can't have a nuclear program that can make a bomb. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=239.04s)]
*  Diplomacy is preferred, as Dick says, but force may be the only option. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  And I've said as clearly as I can say, if diplomacy fails, Mr. President, President Trump, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  great, help Israel finish the job. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=254.04s)]
*  Give them bombs, fly with them if necessary. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=256.03999999999996s)]
*  I cannot stress to you how, if you want to get Russia right, you want to make China be better, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  you want to convince international terrorism, we mean business, you've got to finish the job with Iran. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, we'll see if there is any willingness to negotiate. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  So far we haven't seen much. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  That's a big mistake on Iran's part. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=276.03999999999996s)]
*  It's not on President Trump's. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  If we don't have negotiations, it's not because of Trump. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  It's because of the Ayatollah. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=282.04s)]
*  Or you can't necessarily bomb someone into concessions that they were not willing to make, right? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=284.04s)]
*  I don't think they have any desire to make concessions. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=291.04s)]
*  If Iran miscalculates now, it will face the consequences. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=294.04s)]
*  But there is a road to a deal. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=298.04s)]
*  President Obama reached a deal, far from perfect. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=301.04s)]
*  President Trump ripped it up. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=306.04s)]
*  If it were in effect, maybe we could have stopped the Iran nuclear buildup, which has occurred. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=309.04s)]
*  There are close to 10 bombs now. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=316.04s)]
*  But there is the possibility of diplomacy in the meantime. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=318.04s)]
*  The United States ought to provide the means for Israel to defend against this Iranian retaliation. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=322.04s)]
*  And just to clarify, when you say close to 10 bombs, you mean they would have enough nuclear fuel. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=327.04s)]
*  But as far as we know from the US assessment, they hadn't made the political decision to turn that into a weapon. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=332.04s)]
*  We didn't hear that from the Senate Intel chair when they asked that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=337.04s)]
*  If I may, what purpose is there for enriched uranium at 60% other than making a weapon? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=340.04s)]
*  Why do you have 900 pounds of this stuff if you don't want to make a weapon? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=346.04s)]
*  The assessment was they wanted the leverage, right? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=350.04s)]
*  Yeah, right. Whatever. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=353.04s)]
*  I want to ask you about the bipartisan work you are both doing, if I can. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=355.04s)]
*  By the way, Iran and Russia... [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=359.04s)]
*  And we're bipartisan on this. We say it the same, actually. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=362.04s)]
*  You are. Iran and Russia work together. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=365.04s)]
*  And if I can just add one more point about Iran, because we're going to talk about Russian sanctions, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=367.04s)]
*  I think we ought to strengthen sanctions against Iran, which is a non-kinetic, a peaceful means of exerting pressure. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=372.04s)]
*  I'm hoping that perhaps Senator Graham and I... [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=381.04s)]
*  I will be your wingman. We'll write the bill right here on television. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=383.04s)]
*  China, if you're listening, stop buying Russian oil and stop helping the Iranians. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=386.04s)]
*  You'd make the world a safer place if you would stop. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=390.04s)]
*  They should buy it because it's cheap, though. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=393.04s)]
*  Well, then they should pay a price for propping up Putin's war machine. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=396.04s)]
*  We should crush their economy. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXxJfn5r1Po&t=399.04s)]
