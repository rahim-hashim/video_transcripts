# Watch Netanyahu's address to joint meeting of Congress
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA)
*  as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses a joint meeting of Congress. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=0.0s)]
*  Members of Congress, I now have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=30.0s)]
*  His Excellency Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=52.16s)]
*  Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Senator Ben Cardin, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=90.0s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=103.12s)]
*  Senators, Members of Congress, distinguished guests. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=112.24s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for giving me the profound honor of addressing this great [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=118.16s)]
*  citadel of democracy for the fourth time. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=128.68s)]
*  We meet today at a crossroads of history. Our world is in upheaval. In the Middle East, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=142.0s)]
*  Iran's axis of terror confronts America, Israel, and our Arab friends. This is not a clash of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=151.24s)]
*  civilizations. It's a clash between barbarism and civilization. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  It's a clash between those who glorify death and those who sanctify life. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=171.36s)]
*  For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=181.16000000000003s)]
*  Because when we stand together, something very simple happens. We win, they lose. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=201.36s)]
*  And my friends, I came to assure you today of one thing. We will win. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=232.36s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, like December 7, 1941, and September 11, 2001, October 7 is a day [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=238.84s)]
*  that will forever live in infamy. It was the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah. It began as a [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=268.59999999999997s)]
*  perfect day, not a cloud in the sky. Thousands of young Israelis were celebrating at an outdoor [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=276.76s)]
*  music festival. And suddenly, at 6.29 a.m., as children were still sleeping soundly in their [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=284.2s)]
*  beds in the towns in Kibbutzim next to Gaza, suddenly heaven turned into hell. 3,000 Hamas [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=293.36s)]
*  terrorists stormed into Israel. They butchered 1,200 people from 41 countries, including 39 [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=302.48s)]
*  Americans. Proportionately, compared to our population size, that's like 29-11s in one day. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=312.48s)]
*  And these monsters, they rape women, they beheaded men, they burned babies alive, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=323.44s)]
*  they killed parents in front of their children and children in front of their parents, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=333.0s)]
*  they dragged 255 people, both living and dead, into the dark dungeons of Gaza. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=340.92s)]
*  Israel has already brought home 135 of these hostages, including seven who were freed and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=349.92s)]
*  during rescue operations. One of those freed hostages, Nor Gamani, is here in the gallery, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=357.88s)]
*  sitting near my wife Sarah. On the morning... [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=381.24s)]
*  On the morning of October 7th, the entire world saw Noah's look of desperation as she was [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=411.24s)]
*  violently abducted to Gaza on the back of a motorcycle. I met Noah's mother, Leora, a few [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=418.24s)]
*  months ago. She was dying of cancer. She said to me, Prime Minister, I have one final wish. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=426.6s)]
*  I wish to hug my daughter Noah one last time before I die. Two months ago, I authorized a [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=440.4s)]
*  breathtaking command or rescue operation. Our special forces, including a heroic officer named [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=450.32s)]
*  Arnon Zmora, who fell in this battle, rescued Noah and three other hostages. Noah... [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=458.0s)]
*  I think it's one of the most moving things. When Noah was reunited with her mother, Leora, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=480.0s)]
*  and her mother's last wish came true. Noah, we're so thrilled to have you with us today. Thank you. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=489.28s)]
*  Many hostage families are also here with us today, including Eliau Bibas. Eliau Bibas is the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=510.0s)]
*  grandfather of those two beautiful red-headed boys, the Bibas boys, toddlers. And they were [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=528.64s)]
*  taken hostage with their mother and Eliau's son. The entire family was taken hostage. Two beautiful [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=536.0799999999999s)]
*  red-haired children taken hostage. What monsters. And with us also is Iris Chaim, whose son, Yotam, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=547.68s)]
*  bravely escaped Hamas captivity with two other Israelis, and tragically they were killed making [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=556.48s)]
*  their way back to our lines. We have with us also the families of American hostages. They're here. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=565.16s)]
*  The pain these families have endured is beyond words. I met with them again yesterday, and I [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=572.92s)]
*  promised them this. I will not rest until all their loved ones are home. All of them. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=600.88s)]
*  As we speak, we're actively engaged in intensive efforts to secure their release, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=607.8s)]
*  and I'm confident that these efforts can succeed. Some of them are taking place right now. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=632.64s)]
*  I want to thank President Biden for his tireless efforts on behalf of the hostages, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=638.28s)]
*  and for his efforts to the hostage families as well. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=649.96s)]
*  I thank President Biden for his heartfelt support for Israel after the savage attack [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=662.12s)]
*  on October 7th. He rightly called Hamas sheer evil. He dispatched two aircraft carriers to [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=671.72s)]
*  the Middle East to deter a wider war, and he came to Israel to stand with us during our darkest hour, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=679.16s)]
*  a visit that will never be forgotten. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=686.6800000000001s)]
*  President Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years. I want to thank him for [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=701.48s)]
*  half a century of friendship to Israel, and for being, as he says, a proud Zionist. Actually, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=706.0400000000001s)]
*  a proud Irish-American Zionist. My friends, for more than nine months, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=713.64s)]
*  Israel's soldiers have shown boundless courage. With us today [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=725.7199999999999s)]
*  is Lieutenant Avichael Reuven. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=730.44s)]
*  Avichael Reuven, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=739.72s)]
*  is an officer in the Israeli paratroopers, his family immigrated to Israel from Ethiopia. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=742.2s)]
*  In the early hours of October 7th, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=766.2s)]
*  Avichael heard the news of Hamas's bloody rampage. He put on his uniform, grabbed his rifle, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=770.2800000000001s)]
*  but he didn't have a car. So he ran eight miles to the front lines of Gaza to defend his people. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=779.08s)]
*  You heard that right. He ran eight miles, came to the front lines, killed many terrorists, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=796.5200000000001s)]
*  and saved many, many lives. Avichael, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=815.5600000000001s)]
*  we all honor your remarkable heroism. Another Israeli is here today, and he's standing right [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=820.92s)]
*  next to Avichael. This is Master Sergeant Ashraf al-Bakhiri. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=831.16s)]
*  Ashraf is a veteran soldier from the Israeli Muslim community of Raat. On October 7th, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=850.8399999999999s)]
*  Ashraf too killed many terrorists. First, he defended his comrades in the military base, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=858.04s)]
*  and he then rushed to defend the neighboring communities, including the devastated community [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=863.88s)]
*  of Kibbutzberry. Like Ashraf, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=868.9200000000001s)]
*  the Muslim soldiers of the IDF fought alongside their Jewish, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=880.6s)]
*  Druze, Christian, and other comrades in arms with tremendous bravery. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=884.68s)]
*  A third hero, Lieutenant Asa Sofer, is also here with us. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=898.52s)]
*  Asa fought as an officer in the Tank Corps, and he was wounded in battle. He was wounded in battle [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=928.68s)]
*  while protecting his fellow soldiers from a grenade. He lost his right arm and the vision [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=938.84s)]
*  in his left eye. He's recovering, and incredibly, within a short time, Asa will soon return to [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=945.72s)]
*  active duty as a commander of a tank company. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=956.2s)]
*  I just learned there is a fourth hero here, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=966.04s)]
*  Lieutenant Yonatan Jonathan Benhamo, who lost a leg in Gaza and continued to fight. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=983.3199999999999s)]
*  My friends, these are the soldiers of Israel, unbowed, undaunted, unafraid. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=996.04s)]
*  As the Bible says, Amkelevi yakum. They shall rise like lions. They have risen like lions. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1026.04s)]
*  The lions of Judah, the lions of Israel. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1050.12s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, the men and women of the IDF come from every corner of Israeli society, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1066.76s)]
*  every ethnicity, every color, every creed, left and right, religious and secular. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1075.3200000000002s)]
*  All are imbued with the indomitable spirit of the Maccabees, the legendary Jewish warriors of [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1083.5600000000002s)]
*  antiquity. With us today is Yechiel Leiter, the father of one of those Maccabees. Yechiel's father [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1090.8400000000001s)]
*  escaped the Holocaust and found refuge in America. As a young man, Yechiel moved to Israel and raised [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1099.64s)]
*  a family of eight children. He named his eldest son Moshe after his late father. Moshe became an [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1106.68s)]
*  exemplary officer in one of our elite commander units. He served with distinction for two decades [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1113.96s)]
*  while raising six beautiful children of his own. On October 7th, Moshe volunteered to return to [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1120.2800000000002s)]
*  combat. Four weeks later, he was killed when a booby-trapped mine exploded in a tunnel shaft [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1127.72s)]
*  right next to a mosque. At his son's funeral, Yechiel said this, If the state of Israel had [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1136.52s)]
*  not been established after the Holocaust, the image engraved in our collective memory [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1145.4s)]
*  would have been the photograph of that helpless Jewish boy in the Warsaw Ghetto holding his hands [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1150.92s)]
*  up in the air with Nazi rifles pointed at him. But because of the birth of Israel, Yechiel continued, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1156.44s)]
*  because of the courage of soldiers like my son Moshe, the Jewish people are no longer helpless [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1164.2s)]
*  in the face of our enemies. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1170.68s)]
*  Yechiel, please rise so we can honor your son's sacrifice, and I pledge to you and to all the bereaved [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1186.44s)]
*  families of Israel, some of whom are in this hall today, the sacrifice of your loved ones will not be in vain. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1198.76s)]
*  It will not be in vain, because for Israel, never again must never be an empty promise. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1216.44s)]
*  It must always remain a sacred vow, and after October 7th, never again is now. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1232.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1246.44s)]
*  My friends, defeating our brutal enemies requires both courage and clarity. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1256.2s)]
*  Clarity begins by knowing the difference between good and evil. Yet incredibly, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1262.52s)]
*  many anti-Israel protesters, many choose to stand with evil. They stand with Hamas. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1270.84s)]
*  They stand with rapists and murderers. They stand with people who came into the kibbutzim, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1279.32s)]
*  into a home. The parents hid the children, the two babies, in the attic, in a secret attic. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1285.4799999999998s)]
*  They murder the families, the parents. They find the secret latch to the hidden attic, and then they [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1292.84s)]
*  murder the babies. These protesters stand with them. They should be ashamed of themselves. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1299.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1329.4s)]
*  They refuse to make the simple distinction between those who target terrorists and those who target [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1347.96s)]
*  civilians, between the democratic state of Israel and the terrorist thugs of Hamas. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1354.12s)]
*  We recently learned from the U.S. Director of National Intelligence that Iran is funding and [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1360.6s)]
*  promoting anti-Israel protests in America. They want to disrupt America. So these protesters [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1369.2399999999998s)]
*  burn American flags even on the 4th of July, and I wish to salute the fraternity brothers [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1376.04s)]

*  a colonialist state. Don't they know that the land of Israel is where Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1509.96s)]

*  Well, let me give these befuddled academics a little context. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1599.72s)]
*  Anti-Semitism is the world's oldest hatred. For centuries, the massacre of Jews was always [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1603.32s)]
*  preceded by wild accusations. We were accused of everything from poisoning wells, to spreading [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1610.52s)]
*  plagues, to using the blood of slaughtered children to bake Passover matzahs. These preposterous [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1617.08s)]
*  anti-Semitic lies led to persecution, mass murder, and ultimately to history's worst genocide, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1625.72s)]
*  the Holocaust. Now, just as malicious lies were leveled for centuries at the Jewish people, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1632.1200000000001s)]
*  malicious lies are now being leveled at the Jewish state. No, no, don't applaud. Listen. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1638.84s)]
*  The outrageous slanders that paint Israel as racist and genocidal are meant to delegitimize [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1648.2800000000002s)]
*  Israel, to demonize the Jewish state, and to demonize Jews everywhere. And no wonder, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1654.3600000000001s)]
*  no wonder we've witnessed an appalling rise of anti-Semitism in America and around the world. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1661.16s)]
*  My friends, whenever and wherever, the Jewish people are being labeled as anti-Semitism, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1667.16s)]
*  whenever and wherever we see the scourge of anti-Semitism, we must unequivocally condemn it [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1675.6399999999999s)]
*  and resolutely fight it, without exception. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1683.32s)]
*  And don't be fooled when the blood libos against the Jewish state [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1705.08s)]
*  come from people who wear fancy silk robes and speak in lofty tones about law and justice. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1717.3999999999999s)]
*  Here's a case in point. The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has shamefully [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1725.24s)]
*  accused Israel of deliberately starving the people of Gaza. This is utter complete nonsense. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1730.92s)]
*  It's a complete fabrication. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1737.3200000000002s)]
*  Israel has enabled more than 40,000 aid trucks to enter Gaza. That's half a million tons of food, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1744.3600000000001s)]
*  and that's more than 3,000 calories for every man, woman, and child in Gaza. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1752.3600000000001s)]
*  If there are Palestinians in Gaza who aren't getting enough food, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1758.6000000000001s)]
*  it's not because Israel is blocking it, it's because Hamas is stealing it. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1762.44s)]
*  So much for that lie, but here's another. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1781.0s)]
*  The ICC prosecutor accuses Israel of deliberately targeting civilians. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1784.44s)]
*  What in God's green earth is he talking about? The IDF has dropped millions of flyers, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1790.76s)]
*  sent millions of text messages, made hundreds of thousands of phone calls [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1797.96s)]
*  to get Palestinian civilians out of harm's way. But at the same time, Hamas does everything in [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1802.6s)]
*  its power to put Palestinian civilians in harm's way. They fire rockets from schools, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1809.88s)]
*  from hospitals, from mosques. They even shoot their own people when they try to leave the war zone. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1816.44s)]
*  A senior Hamas official, Fatih Hamad, boasted that Palestinian women and children [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1824.92s)]
*  excel at being human shields. His words, excel at being human shields. What monstrous evil. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1832.44s)]
*  For Israel, every civilian death is a tragedy. For Hamas, it's a strategy. They actually want [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1841.0s)]
*  Palestinian civilians to die so that Israel will be smeared in the international media [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1850.3600000000001s)]
*  and be pressured to end the war before it's won. This would enable Hamas to survive another day [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1855.8s)]
*  and as they vowed to carry out October 7th again and again and again. Well, I want to assure you, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1862.28s)]
*  no matter what pressure is brought to bear, I will never allow that to happen. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1870.28s)]
*  The vast majority of Americans have not fallen for this Hamas propaganda. They continue to support [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1893.24s)]
*  Israel and I want to say thank you America and thank you senators and house members who continue [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1899.6399999999999s)]
*  to support us, continue to support Israel, continue to support the truth and see through the lies. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1905.3999999999999s)]
*  But as for the minority that may have fallen for Hamas' cons job, I suggest you listen to Colonel [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1912.2s)]
*  John Spencer. John Spencer is head of urban warfare studies at West Point. He studied every [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1920.04s)]
*  major urban conflict, I was going to say in modern history. He corrected me, no, in history. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1927.48s)]
*  Israel, he said, has implemented more precautions to prevent civilian harm [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1935.64s)]
*  than any military in history and beyond what international law requires. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1941.8s)]
*  That's why despite all the lies you've heard, the war in Gaza has one of the lowest ratios of [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1949.72s)]
*  combatants to non-combatants casualties in the history of urban warfare. And you want to know [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1972.3600000000001s)]
*  where it's lowest in Gaza? It's lowest in Rafah. In Rafah. Remember what so many people said? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1979.24s)]
*  If Israel goes into Rafah, there'll be thousands, maybe even tens of thousands of civilians killed. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1990.36s)]
*  Well, last week I went into Rafah. I visited our troops as they finished fighting Hamas' [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=1997.96s)]
*  remaining terrorist battalions. I asked the commander there, how many terrorists did you [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2004.28s)]
*  take out in Rafah? He gave me an exact number, 1,203. I asked him, how many civilians were killed? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2010.76s)]
*  He said, prime minister, practically none, with the exception of a single incident [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2020.76s)]
*  where shrapnel from a bomb hit a Hamas weapons depot and unintentionally killed two dozen people. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2028.4399999999998s)]
*  The answer is, practically none. You want to know why? Because Israel got the civilians out of harm's [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2035.0s)]
*  way, something people said we could never do, but we did it. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2042.52s)]
*  These heroes here today, the heroic soldiers of Israel, should not be condemned for how they're [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2058.6800000000003s)]
*  conducting the war in Gaza. They should be commended for it. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2066.76s)]
*  I want to thank all of you here today who forcefully opposed the false accusations of the ICC [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2079.96s)]
*  and stood up for the truth. These lies are not only libelous, they're downright dangerous. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2093.08s)]
*  The ICC is trying to shackle Israel's hands and prevent us from defending ourselves, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2099.64s)]
*  and if Israel's hands are tied, America is next, and I'll tell you what else is next. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2104.68s)]
*  The ability of all democracies to fight terrorism will be in peril. That's what's on the line, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2111.24s)]
*  so let me assure you the hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled. Israel will always [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2117.64s)]
*  defend itself. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2123.88s)]
*  My friends in the Middle East, Iran is virtually beyond, behind all the terrorism, all the turmoil, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2143.88s)]
*  all the chaos, all the killing, and that should come as no surprise. When he founded the Islamic [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2153.4s)]
*  Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini pledged, we will export our revolution to the entire world. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2160.28s)]
*  We will export the Islamic revolution to the entire world. Now ask yourself, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2168.6s)]
*  which country ultimately stands in the way of Iran's maniacal plans to impose radical Islam on [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2176.36s)]
*  the world? And the answer is clear. It's America, the guardian of Western civilization and the [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2182.76s)]
*  world's greatest power. That's why Iran sees America as its greatest enemy. Last month, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2189.48s)]
*  we heard a revealing comment, ostensibly about the war in Gaza, but about something else. It came [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2213.48s)]
*  from the Foreign Minister of Iran's proxy, Hezbollah, and he said this. This is not a war with [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2221.32s)]
*  Israel. Israel, he said, is merely a tool. The main war, the real war, is with America. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2227.0800000000004s)]
*  Iran's regime has been fighting America from the moment it came to power. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2237.0s)]
*  In 1979, it stormed the American embassy. It held scores of Americans hostage for 444 days. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2241.0s)]
*  Since then, Iran's terrorist proxies have targeted America in the Middle East and beyond. In Beirut, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2250.2000000000003s)]
*  they killed 241 US servicemen. In Africa, they bombed American embassies. In Iraq, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2256.92s)]
*  they supplied explosives to maim and kill thousands of American soldiers. In America, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2263.88s)]
*  they actually sent death squads here to murder a former Secretary of State and a former National [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2272.6s)]
*  Security Advisor. As we recently learned, they even brazenly threatened to assassinate President [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2280.36s)]
*  Trump. But Iran understands that to truly challenge America, it must first conquer the [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2286.44s)]
*  Middle East. And for this, it uses its many proxies, including the Houthis, Hezbollah, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2293.96s)]
*  and Hamas. Yet in the heart of the Middle East, standing in Iran's way, is one proud pro-American [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2300.84s)]
*  democracy, my country, the State of Israel. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2309.0s)]
*  That's why the mobs in Tehran chant death to Israel before they chant death to America. For Iran, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2319.7999999999997s)]
*  Israel is first, America is next. So when Israel fights Hamas, we're fighting Iran. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2343.16s)]
*  When we fight Hezbollah, we're fighting Iran. When we fight the Houthis, we're fighting Iran. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2349.8s)]
*  And when we fight Iran, we're fighting the most radical and murderous enemy of the United States [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2355.64s)]
*  of America. And one more thing, when Israel acts to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2360.7599999999998s)]
*  nuclear weapons that could destroy Israel and threaten every American city, every city that [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2369.56s)]
*  you come from, we're not only protecting ourselves, we're protecting you. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2375.16s)]
*  My friends, if you remember one thing, one thing from the speech, remember this. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2398.92s)]
*  Our enemies are your enemies. Our fight is your fight. And our victory will be your victory. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2405.56s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, that victory is in sight. Israel's defeat of Hamas will be a powerful blow [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2429.0s)]
*  to Iran's axis of terror. Another part of that axis, Hezbollah, attacked Israel on October 8th, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2440.12s)]
*  a day after the Hamas attack. It has launched thousands of missiles and drones against us. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2447.88s)]
*  80,000 of our citizens in northern Israel evacuated their homes, becoming effectively [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2455.56s)]

*  Last Friday, a third Iranian proxy, the Khutis, attacked Tel Aviv with a deadly drone. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2495.96s)]
*  It exploded a few hundred feet from the American consulate, killing one person and injuring nine. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2503.0s)]
*  On Saturday, I authorized a swift response to that attack. All our enemies should know this. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2510.9199999999996s)]
*  Those who attack Israel will pay a very heavy price. And as we defend ourselves, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2518.9199999999996s)]
*  on all fronts, I know that America has our back. And I thank you for it. All sides of the aisle, thank you. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2532.2s)]
*  My friends, for decades, America has provided Israel with generous military assistance. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2549.9599999999996s)]
*  And a grateful Israel has provided America with critical intelligence that saved many lives. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2555.72s)]
*  We've jointly developed some of the most sophisticated weapons on Earth. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2562.6s)]
*  I choose my words carefully. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2568.04s)]
*  We've jointly developed some of the most sophisticated weapons on Earth. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2575.08s)]
*  I choose my words carefully. We've jointly developed some of the most sophisticated weapons on Earth [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2578.44s)]
*  that help protect both our countries. And we also help keep American boots off the ground [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2584.52s)]
*  while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2593.8s)]
*  I deeply appreciate America's support, including in this current war. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2605.0s)]
*  But this is an exceptional moment. Fast-tracking U.S. military aid can dramatically expedite an [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2618.2s)]
*  end to the war in Gaza and help prevent a broader war in the Middle East. In World War II, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2625.56s)]
*  as Britain fought on the front lines of civilization, Winston Churchill appealed to Americans [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2631.88s)]
*  with these famous words, give us the tools and we'll finish the job. Today, as Israel fights on [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2637.96s)]
*  the front line of civilization, I too appeal to America. Give us the tools faster and we'll [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2645.8s)]
*  finish the job faster. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2651.96s)]
*  My dear friends, the war in Gaza could end tomorrow if Hamas surrenders, disarms, and returns all the hostages. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2661.8s)]
*  But if they don't, Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities, end its rule in Gaza, and bring all our hostages home. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2691.8s)]
*  That's what total victory means and we will settle for nothing less. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2705.48s)]
*  The day after we defeat Hamas, a new Gaza can emerge. My vision for that day is of a demilitarized and [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2721.16s)]
*  deradicalized Gaza. Israel does not seek to resettle Gaza, but for the foreseeable future, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2736.2s)]
*  we must retain overriding security control there to prevent the resurgence of terror, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2743.0s)]
*  to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2748.52s)]
*  Gaza should have a civilian administration run by Palestinians who do not seek to destroy Israel. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2762.6s)]
*  That's not too much to ask. It's a fundamental thing that we have a right to demand and to receive. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2768.92s)]
*  A new generation of Palestinians must no longer be taught to hate Jews, but rather to live in peace with us. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2778.52s)]
*  Those twin words demilitarization and deradicalization, those two concepts were applied to Germany and Japan [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2792.44s)]
*  after World War II and that led to decades of peace, prosperity, and security. Following our victory, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2807.64s)]
*  with the help of regional partners, the demilitarization and deradicalization of Gaza [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2815.64s)]
*  can also lead to a future of security, prosperity, and peace. That's my vision for Gaza. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2822.52s)]
*  That's my vision for Gaza. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2829.96s)]
*  Now here's my vision for the broader Middle East. It's also shaped in part by what we saw in the [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2840.44s)]
*  aftermath of World War II. After that war, America forged a security alliance in Europe [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2850.12s)]
*  to counter the growing Soviet threat. Likewise, America and Israel today can forge a security [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2857.32s)]
*  alliance in the Middle East to counter the growing Iranian threat. All countries that are at peace [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2864.36s)]
*  with Israel and all those countries who will make peace with Israel should be invited to join this [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2870.44s)]
*  alliance. We saw a glimpse of that potential alliance on April 14th, led by the United States [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2876.6000000000004s)]
*  more than half a dozen nations worked alongside Israel to help neutralize hundreds of missiles [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2886.92s)]
*  and drones launched by Iran against us. Thank you President Biden for bringing that coalition together. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2892.84s)]
*  The new alliance I envisioned would be a natural extension of the groundbreaking Abraham Accords. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2900.28s)]
*  Those accords saw peace forged between Israel and four Arab countries, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2921.2400000000002s)]
*  and they were supported by Republicans and Democrats alike. We could call [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2925.72s)]
*  I have a name for this new alliance. I think we should call it the Abraham Alliance. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2933.7999999999997s)]
*  I want to thank President Trump for his leadership in brokering the Starker Abraham Accords. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2944.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2955.4s)]
*  Like Americans, Israelis were relieved that President Trump emerged safe and sound from that [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2965.7999999999997s)]
*  dastardly attack on him, dastardly attack on American democracy. There is no room for [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2971.96s)]
*  political violence in democracies. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2978.04s)]
*  I also want to thank President Trump for all the things he did for Israel, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2993.56s)]
*  from recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, to confronting Iran's aggression, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=2997.96s)]
*  to recognizing Jerusalem as our capital and moving the American embassy there. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3003.24s)]
*  That's Jerusalem, our eternal capital, never to be divided again. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3022.2s)]
*  My dear friends, Democrats and Republicans, despite these times of upheaval, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3033.24s)]
*  I am hopeful about the future. I'm hopeful about Israel because my people, the Jewish people, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3049.8799999999997s)]
*  emerged from the depths of hell, from dispossession and genocide. And against all odds, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3057.48s)]
*  we restored our sovereignty in our ancient homeland. We built a powerful and vibrant democracy, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3064.76s)]
*  a democracy that pushes the boundaries of innovation for the betterment of all humanity. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3071.7200000000003s)]

*  All right, an historic speech, a real moment there. We all just witnessed the first world leader to [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3330.92s)]
*  address a joint meeting of Congress for a fourth time. That distinction going to Israeli Prime [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3337.64s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu right now. And he framed this moment as, quote, a crossroads in [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3342.8399999999997s)]
*  history. He also went on to describe the war between Israel and Hamas as a clash between [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3349.72s)]
*  barbarism and civilization. And he says Israel must stand with America. America must stand with [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3355.16s)]
*  Israel, he says, because when we do, we win, they lose. And we heard him also speak of the horror [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3361.64s)]
*  of Hamas' October 7th attack, saying it's a day that will live forever in infamy. But Lana, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3368.7599999999998s)]
*  we also listened to him go on the attack against protesters. He called many of them anti-Israeli [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3374.2s)]
*  protesters. He says, are useful idiots, saying that many of them are funded by Iran. And he also [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3379.96s)]
*  rebuked the International Criminal Court's allegations of starving residents of Gaza. He says that is a [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3385.16s)]
*  complete fabrication. So quite a moment there. Yeah, and really trying to thread that needle, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3390.28s)]
*  given all the politics that are happening in this country, by really leaning on that shared history [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3394.84s)]
*  that the United States and Israel has, ending his speech talking about together vanquishing the [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3401.0800000000004s)]
*  tyrants and terrorists that threaten us both. And when he was talking about that October 7th Hamas [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3405.5600000000004s)]
*  attack, he tried to quantify it. And Netanyahu, we heard, said that by population, October 7th [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3411.2400000000002s)]
*  was equivalent to 29-11s here in this country. We also heard him talking about the guests in the [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3417.64s)]
*  chamber, including members of the IDF, one with Mikhail, who he referred to as a paratrooper from [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3424.6s)]
*  Ethiopia, who donned his uniform and then ran eight miles to the front lines to try and serve. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3432.2799999999997s)]
*  And then, of course, we saw him celebrate Noah Garmany. That's the hostage who was freed in that [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3438.3599999999997s)]

*  hostages, saying he would not rest until all of them were home. And I thought it was very [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3451.16s)]
*  interesting, Errol, how he thanked President Biden for his years of support for Israel, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3455.8s)]
*  calling him and using his own language an Irish-American Zionist, and then extensively also [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3461.08s)]

*  in moving the capital formerly to Jerusalem. He also said that he would commit himself fully [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3475.96s)]
*  to freeing the hostages and that he would not back down in any way. All right, we have full [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3484.6s)]

*  the end of it. They are fed up. They are angry. They've been protesting almost every single week [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3527.56s)]
*  since the war began. And the message here was very clear today. They are not interested in what [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3534.2s)]
*  Netanyahu has to say from Congress. The speech was beamed live here into the square. The only [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3541.0s)]
*  thing they want to hear from their prime minister is that there's a deal. Yeah. And Deborah, I want [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3547.32s)]
*  to stick with you for another moment because here in the United States, a lot of the protests have [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3553.16s)]
*  not just been about bringing hostages home, but have also been about the conditions for [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3557.64s)]
*  the civilians in Gaza. And we heard the prime minister trying to take that on, saying that [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3564.3599999999997s)]
*  Israel has allowed 40,000 aid trucks. And he said if there are Palestinians in Gaza that are not [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3569.7999999999997s)]
*  getting enough food, it's that Israel is blocking it. And it's not that Israel is blocking it, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3574.44s)]
*  rather that it is that Hamas is stealing it. I'm wondering how some of the points that the [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3579.4s)]
*  prime minister made here in this country were being received by the protesters who were gathered there [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3585.2400000000002s)]
*  in Tel Aviv. Well, I can tell you only what we saw and witnessed here at hostage squares, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3590.44s)]
*  that there were moments when protesters booed Netanyahu as he was speaking because there is [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3598.36s)]
*  just so much frustration. This is a broad coalition of protesters. You have people, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3604.44s)]
*  some of whom were protesting before the war began, protesting against Netanyahu's judicial [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3610.04s)]
*  reforms. And then you've got people who are family members of the hostages who are saying there needs [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3616.2000000000003s)]
*  to be a deal. There are anti-war protesters. So it's a very, very broad coalition here. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3621.56s)]
*  But there was one overwhelming emotion, frustration, anger, fury. Netanyahu, they say, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3627.24s)]
*  should not have gone to Washington. He should be home. He should be finalizing that deal. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3635.0s)]
*  And that there is one urgent mission now. And the only urgent mission, they say, is to bring the [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3640.6s)]
*  hostages back. There are still 100 people in captivity in Gaza. And Olivia, what's interesting [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3646.6s)]
*  about the fury that Deborah is mentioning in Tel Aviv is that here in the U.S., within Congress, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3654.52s)]
*  many members, I mean, Democratic members, more progressive members, decided to boycott Netanyahu's [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3660.68s)]
*  speech because of a similar anger and frustration over how he has carried out the war with Hamas. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3666.04s)]
*  What stood out to you as far as the way he was received and some of the comments he made trying [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3671.8s)]
*  to defend his record? Sure, Errol. Well, I think as you and Lana pointed out in your recap there, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3677.24s)]
*  the prime minister made a glancing effort at being conciliatory and gracious at the top and [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3683.32s)]
*  at the end of his speech, thanking the current president and the former president for their [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3688.92s)]
*  efforts to support Israel. But there were definitely meaty parts of his speech in the middle that took [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3693.1600000000003s)]
*  a darker, more defiant, and at times more dishonest tone after he acknowledged the hostage families [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3698.28s)]
*  and the heroes in the audience recognizing their bravery and their persistence in the face of real [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3704.76s)]
*  terror. He did take to criticizing, in a very unnuanced and arguably very not self-aware fashion, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3711.16s)]
*  protesters who have convened to protest Israel's conduct during the course of the war. He cited an [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3718.68s)]
*  American intelligence assessment suggesting that Iran had financially backed some of those protesters, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3724.6s)]
*  saying that Iran wanted to disrupt America, saying they were Iran's useful idiots, but again, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3731.16s)]
*  allowing for no nuance against the very real fact that there have been outsized civilian [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3737.32s)]
*  casualties in this war. You cited the criticism he lodged at the ICC's claim that because Israel—that [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3744.92s)]
*  aid is not getting in because Israel is blocking it, but because Hamas is stealing it. The U.S. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3752.6800000000003s)]
*  government, world governments, countless NGOs have name-checked Israel for preventing aid from [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3757.88s)]
*  getting in, and there are relatively few documented instances of Hamas fighters actually [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3763.24s)]
*  pilfering that aid and distributing it among themselves. Not that it's never happened, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3768.4399999999996s)]
*  but it's not the outsized reason why aid is not getting in. He also pushed back on the notion that [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3772.2s)]
*  Israel is not protecting civilians, saying that it had distributed leaflets, pamphlets, called citizens [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3777.3999999999996s)]
*  of Gaza to clear areas where military operations are imminent, when in fact a U.S. State Department [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3783.3199999999997s)]
*  assessment commissioned by the White House, known as NSM-20, clearly concluded that Israeli [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3788.44s)]
*  forces were not doing enough, that had potentially violated international humanitarian war in their [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3793.88s)]
*  conduct, and that the efficacy of distributing those leaflets and pamphlets was questionable. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3799.6400000000003s)]
*  And it's also belied by the fact that there are a number of ongoing criminal investigations within [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3805.8s)]
*  Israel into its military forces conduct that have not yet been prosecuted but are open and ongoing. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3810.1200000000003s)]
*  So it was kind of a one-sided defense of Israel's conduct militarily in this war, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3817.16s)]
*  something that lots of protesters have come out to call out. He said instead that Israel [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3822.2s)]
*  shouldn't be criticized for it, its forces should be commended for it, launching then into a [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3827.72s)]
*  criticism of Iran, widely expected, a shared adversary with the United States, and an allusion [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3831.96s)]
*  to the fact that the U.S. and Israel had cooperated jointly on developing some of the most [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3839.48s)]
*  sophisticated weapons on earth, without specifying what that is, but stressing that the alliance [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3847.08s)]
*  between the U.S. and Israel was absolutely essential to preventing Iran from spreading [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3852.6s)]
*  its malign behavior in the region. He also used the common phrase that we've heard for him for [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3858.6s)]
*  months now, since at least January, that victory is in sight. But he said very little, for as much [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3864.68s)]
*  as he acknowledged the hostages, about ongoing efforts to broker an actual hostage deal or [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3870.52s)]
*  ceasefire deal. He made just a very glancing comment saying, I'm confident that those efforts [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3875.72s)]
*  can succeed, saying that they were intensive and underway, some of them taking place right now, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3881.0s)]
*  without really specifying whether that was talks or some other operation in order to secure [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3885.72s)]
*  the release of hostages. It is notable, in fact, that some of the Israeli delegation that was [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3890.52s)]
*  expected to reengage in in-person talks tomorrow has been delayed to next week. So in sum, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3895.7999999999997s)]
*  darker, more dishonest point is in the middle of the speech, although he tried to strike [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3901.72s)]
*  that conciliatory tone to appease both parties in the course of his remarks as well. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3905.64s)]
*  Yes, and Olivia, I'm going to point out something that came from our Margaret Brennan [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3910.04s)]
*  when she was interviewing Secretary of State Blinken. He said, quote, [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3915.56s)]
*  it is reasonable to assess that in a number of instances Israel has not acted in a manner [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3920.6s)]
*  that's consistent with international humanitarian law. And on that, I want to go back to our Deborah [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3925.7999999999997s)]
*  Pata, because Deborah, I have to say the piece that you had on CBS Mornings today with that baby [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3930.36s)]
*  who had just been hit by shrapnel was so horrific. You have been reporting ad nauseam on the situation [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3938.04s)]
*  in Gaza. When Netanyahu says that Hamas is using Palestinians as human shields, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3947.1600000000003s)]
*  there's certainly truth to that. But there's also certainly a fair amount of criticism that [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3959.1600000000003s)]
*  the way that Netanyahu is conducting this war has not fully protected civilians to the level that [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3966.44s)]
*  the international court certainly feels it should. I'm hoping that you can tell us a little bit more [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3974.6000000000004s)]
*  about your reporting in the region and what you have seen. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3980.6000000000004s)]
*  Well, you know, Lana, we interviewed a doctor a few days ago, an American doctor who was [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3988.52s)]
*  volunteering for his second mission to Gaza. And he told us that of the casualties that they were [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=3993.6400000000003s)]
*  overwhelmed with in their hospitals, where they do not have enough supplies, they have run out of [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4001.0s)]
*  beds, they've even run out of gauze to use in the operating theaters. They haven't had hygiene [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4005.88s)]
*  equipment and resources for several months now for people to sort of wash their bodies. They [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4013.4s)]
*  don't even have basic things like Tylenol because trucks are being held up at the border, he said, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4019.16s)]
*  by Israelis. And he said that of the casualties that are coming into his hospital, about two [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4025.96s)]
*  thirds were women and children. Every day children are dying in Gaza. The little girl that you [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4033.08s)]
*  mentioned, she is 18 months old. She has lost both her parents covered in shrapnel and burn [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4038.44s)]
*  wounds. She had to be treated on the floor of the hospital. She is sleeping in a cardboard box [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4044.92s)]
*  because they no longer have any hospital beds. That is the level that hospitals in Gaza who are [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4053.4s)]
*  overwhelmed with casualties, we again saw another horrific week. And when it comes to things like [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4059.56s)]
*  we warned civilians that Netanyahu spoke about in his speech and Olivia mentioned the report that [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4065.24s)]
*  the US has drawn up, we know from our own producer Marwan Al Ghul, our team in Gaza on the ground, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4071.3199999999997s)]
*  that on the weekend when the Israeli military intensified its operations in Khan Yunus, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4079.24s)]
*  an area that they were supposed to have cleared, that they are going back to again, when they [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4085.64s)]
*  announced that they would be doing this, they literally handed out evacuation orders and [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4090.92s)]
*  shortly after that, then the bombing began, leaving no time for people to flee. And that is why you saw [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4096.52s)]
*  so many civilian casualties. And I interviewed the mother of one of the hostages being held in [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4103.64s)]
*  Gaza, Rachel Goldberg-Pollin, and she said to me that the military has diminished Hamas's capacity [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4109.64s)]
*  to launch another October 7. That the time now is to bring those hostages back. That is [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4117.24s)]
*  the only priority. So you have people yearning on both sides, in Gaza and outside here in Israel, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4123.24s)]
*  wanting some kind of cease-fire deal that can end the suffering. Because as she said, there is [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4131.639999999999s)]
*  so much suffering in this region, so much misery all around. Such an important reminder and it's [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4137.96s)]
*  why the U.S. wants some type of cease-fire agreement and a day after plan so there can be [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4144.6s)]
*  more peace in the region. Our appreciation, of course, to Deborah Pater and Olivia Garces [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4149.08s)]
*  for joining us during our coverage of Prime Minister Netanyahu's address to a joint meeting of [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4154.360000000001s)]
*  Congress. Thank you. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnV-9u91ZA&t=4159.160000000001s)]
