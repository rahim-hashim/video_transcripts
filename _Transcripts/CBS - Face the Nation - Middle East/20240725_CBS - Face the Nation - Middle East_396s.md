# Harris says she "will not be silent" on humanitarian crisis in Gaza
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4)
*  We want to take you live to the White House where Vice President Kamala Harris is speaking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=0.0s)]
*  to reporters after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=6.88s)]
*  Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=10.96s)]
*  On October 7, Hamas triggered this war when it massacred 1,200 innocent people, including [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=16.52s)]
*  44 Americans. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=24.68s)]
*  Hamas has committed horrific acts of sexual violence and took 250 hostages. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=26.88s)]
*  There are American citizens who remain captive in Gaza. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Sagi Dekohen, Hirsch Goldberg-Polen, Idan Alexander, Keith Siegel, Omer Nutra, and the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  remains of American citizens Judy Weinstein, Gad Haggai, and Itai Hen are still being held [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=53.04s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=62.28s)]
*  I have met with the families of these American hostages multiple times now, and I've told [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=64.0s)]
*  them each time they are not alone and I stand with them. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=70.08s)]
*  And President Biden and I are working every day to bring them home. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=75.64s)]
*  I also expressed with the Prime Minister my serious concern about the scale of human [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=81.56s)]
*  suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  And I made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there, with [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  over 2 million people facing high levels of food insecurity and half a million people [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=101.8s)]
*  facing catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=109.32s)]
*  What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=115.08s)]
*  The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=119.91999999999999s)]
*  displaced for the second, third, or fourth time. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=127.52s)]
*  We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=132.56s)]
*  We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=136.1s)]
*  Thanks to the leadership of our President Joe Biden, there is a deal on the table for [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=144.26s)]
*  a ceasefire and a hostage deal, and it is important that we recall what the deal involves. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=148.66s)]
*  The first phase of the deal would bring about a full ceasefire, including a withdrawal of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=156.66s)]
*  the Israeli military from population centers in Gaza. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=162.5s)]
*  In the second phase, the Israeli military would withdraw from Gaza entirely, and it [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=167.3s)]
*  would lead to a permanent end to the hostilities. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=173.3s)]
*  It is time for this war to end, and end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=178.1s)]
*  are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=185.64s)]
*  exercise their right to freedom, dignity, and self-determination. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=193.04s)]
*  There has been hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal, and as [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=199.76s)]
*  I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=205.44s)]
*  So to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire, and to everyone who yearns for [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=211.56s)]
*  peace, I see you and I hear you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=217.08s)]
*  Let's get the deal done so we can get a ceasefire to end the war. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=221.96s)]
*  Let's bring the hostages home, and let's provide much needed relief to the Palestinian [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=227.16s)]
*  people. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=233.24s)]
*  And ultimately, I remain committed to a path forward that can lead to a two-state solution. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=235.2s)]
*  And I know right now it is hard to conceive of that prospect, but a two-state solution [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=243.11999999999998s)]
*  is the only path that ensures Israel remains a secure Jewish and democratic state, and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=249.56s)]
*  one that ensures Palestinians can finally realize the freedom, security, and prosperity [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=257.14s)]
*  that they rightly deserve. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=263.68s)]
*  And I will close with this then. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=266.76s)]
*  It is important for the American people to remember the war in Gaza is not a binary issue. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  However, too often the conversation is binary, when the reality is anything but. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=275.72s)]
*  So I ask my fellow Americans to help encourage efforts to acknowledge the complexity, the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=283.7s)]
*  nuance, and the history of the region. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  Let us all condemn terrorism and violence. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=294.64s)]
*  Let us all do what we can to prevent the suffering of innocent civilians. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=298.56s)]
*  And let us condemn anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and hate of any kind. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  And let us work to unite our country. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=312.64s)]
*  I thank you. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=315.71999999999997s)]
*  Madam Vice President, Madam Vice President, after your meeting, are you... [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=316.8s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris not taking questions from reporters. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=321.04s)]
*  She was speaking after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=324.76000000000005s)]
*  The Vice President you heard there at the end speaking about the complexity of the issue, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=329.98s)]
*  that saying it is not a binary issue and that Americans need to acknowledge the complexity. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  She tried to do that in her remarks as well, calling out Hamas for its horrific attack [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  on the 7th of October, but also saying to those who are concerned about the bloodshed, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=345.22s)]
*  violence, and refugees in Gaza, I see you and I hear you. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=351.02000000000004s)]
*  Also the Vice President there speaking in concert with the President's policy of supporting [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=356.90000000000003s)]
*  a two-state solution after the peace deal, should one come about at the end of this conflict [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  after a multi-stage ceasefire deal that the President has put forward. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=370.22s)]
*  If that were to come to be, she supports a two-state solution. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=373.86s)]
*  That is not something that the Prime Minister of Israel has supported, Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=378.1s)]
*  And this of course all in the new reality of American politics, where the Vice President [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=385.26s)]
*  is not just speaking now as a member of the administration, but as the likely Democratic nominee. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnNRr_BzGN4&t=390.42s)]
