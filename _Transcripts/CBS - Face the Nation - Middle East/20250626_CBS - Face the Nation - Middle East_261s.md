# No date set for Iran meeting, White House says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0)
*  Welcome back. Just moments ago, press secretary Caroline Levitt gave an update at a press briefing at the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=0.0s)]
*  She zeroed in on the U.S. strikes in Iran and what the Trump administration calls a successful mission. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=7.0s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News White House reporter Olivia Rinaldi for much more on this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=13.0s)]
*  Olivia, thank you for joining us once again today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=17.0s)]
*  We know Levitt seemed to give an update on what that, on that meeting rather with the Iran, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=20.0s)]
*  that President Trump alluded to earlier this week when he was attending the NATO Summit. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=25.0s)]
*  What did we learn about that? Is it really actually going to happen? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=30.0s)]
*  Yeah, Mugo, that is the question we know when the president was at that NATO summit. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=33.0s)]
*  He held a press conference where he said that the U.S. would be meeting with Iran next week. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=39.0s)]
*  That made a little bit of news and a lot of questions. Who would be meeting with Iran? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=45.0s)]
*  Would it be Steve Witkoff, the special envoy? Would it be any higher-ups in government? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=48.0s)]
*  What would this actually look like? Take a listen to what Caroline Levitt said specifically about that meeting [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=53.0s)]
*  and whether or not it's even going to happen. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=58.0s)]
*  We don't have anything scheduled as of now, but I spoke to our special envoy, Witkoff, at length this morning, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=63.0s)]
*  and I can assure all of you we continue to be in close communication with the Iranians [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=68.0s)]
*  and through our intermediaries as well, namely the Qataris, who have been an incredible ally and partner [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=73.0s)]
*  throughout this entire effort. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=78.0s)]
*  And as I said, this administration is always focused on diplomacy and peace, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=80.0s)]
*  and we want to ensure we can get to a place where Iran agrees to a non-enrichment civil nuclear program. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=84.0s)]
*  And there are many other requests that the United States has. Those details continue to really â€“ they're just starting. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=91.0s)]
*  Of course, the operation was just on Saturday night, but we are in touch. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=97.0s)]
*  And if there is a meeting, we will let you know, as we always do. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=101.0s)]
*  So no meeting scheduled yet, but you do hear from the White House podium there that they are focused on diplomacy [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=104.0s)]
*  and trying to figure out really what are the next steps forward. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=112.0s)]
*  You heard her mention civil non-enrichment nuclear programs in Iran. Well, what does that look like exactly? Mugo? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=115.0s)]
*  Yeah, just all very important questions there. We also know, I was going to say, that our Jennifer Jacobs, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=125.0s)]
*  she got two questions in. What did we learn there? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=130.0s)]
*  Yes, the amazing Jennifer Jacobs got in two questions at that briefing on two very important topics, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=135.0s)]
*  one being that big, beautiful bill, which we keep talking about. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=141.0s)]
*  There's only eight days until the president says he wants to see it on his desk so he can sign it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=145.0s)]
*  Still has to pass the Senate, then go back to the House and get signed there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=150.0s)]
*  And Jennifer also asked about a potential meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=154.0s)]
*  Take a listen to her questions here. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=160.0s)]
*  We expect that bill to be on the president's desk for signature by July 4th. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=163.0s)]
*  I know that there was a ruling by the Senate parliamentarian this morning. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=167.0s)]
*  Look, this is part of the process. This is part of the inner workings of the United States Senate. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=171.0s)]
*  But the president is adamant about seeing this bill on his desk here at the White House by Independence Day. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=176.0s)]
*  And then on Israel, is there a date set for the prime minister to visit the White House yet? Is he coming in a couple weeks? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=181.0s)]
*  There isn't a date, but the prime minister has expressed interest in coming to the White House to meet with the president and come to Washington. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=187.0s)]
*  The president is obviously very open to that, but we don't have a date when we do. We'll let you all know. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=193.0s)]
*  So two big questions about what is coming up for the president. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=202.0s)]
*  One being that meeting with Netanyahu, that would be the first time the two meet in person since not only they struck Iran, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=205.0s)]
*  but two, that ceasefire was agreed to after the president had used a curse word when talking about what Israel knows they're doing in Iran. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=212.0s)]
*  The second being about the big, beautiful bill, which they said the hope is that it is signed on the desk by July 4th. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=221.0s)]
*  But she mentioned the Senate parliamentarian there who made a ruling that essentially upended a lot of the health care policy that is in the Senate bill. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=228.0s)]
*  And you can imagine, Mugho, that health care policy is something that is very delicate to go through and to sort out here in Washington. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=236.0s)]
*  So because of that, we'll have to see just exactly what the timeline looks like. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=245.0s)]
*  Seems like this White House is still holding very firm on that July 4th deadline. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=249.0s)]
*  All right. We shall wait and see. So many things that we have to wait and see about. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=253.0s)]
*  Olivia Renaldi, thank you so much for joining us and for your reporting. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYLBya-yd0&t=258.0s)]
