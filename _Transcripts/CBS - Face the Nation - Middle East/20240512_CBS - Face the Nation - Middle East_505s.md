# Blinken says U.S. won't back Rafah incursion without "credible plan" to protect civilians
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag)
*  We are learning more about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza as thousands are fleeing what [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=0.0s)]
*  was once a safe zone, the southern city of Rafa. The challenges facing the Biden administration [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=5.84s)]
*  from a diplomatic standpoint continue to grow too. Although the U.S. supports Israel's right to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=11.52s)]
*  retaliate against Hamas for the brutal October 7th attack that killed more than 1200 people, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=17.12s)]
*  there are deep concerns about the Palestinian death toll as even Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=23.2s)]
*  conceded that his forces have in fact killed more civilians than members of Hamas. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=28.88s)]
*  We begin this morning with Secretary of State Antony Blinken who joins us from the State [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=34.8s)]
*  Department. Good morning Mr. Secretary. I know military experts say Gaza is as complicated [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=39.92s)]
*  and challenging a battlefield as any modern warfare has seen, but back in December President Biden [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  said Israel conducted indiscriminate bombing. In February he said Israel's offensive was over [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=54.16s)]
*  the top and then this past week he was asked on CNN about pausing the delivery of 3500 bombs. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=60.16s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=66.96s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, is Israel living up to international humanitarian law standards? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=84.16s)]
*  Well first, Margaret, good morning. The report that we put out lays out some of the concerns [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=93.44s)]
*  that we've had throughout this period when it comes to humanitarian assistance, particularly [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=100.16s)]
*  the early months after October 7th and when it comes to the use of weapons, concerns about [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=104.8s)]
*  incidents where given the totality of the damage that's been done to children, women, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=111.92s)]
*  men, it was reasonable to assess that in certain instances Israel acted in ways that are not [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=121.2s)]
*  consistent with international humanitarian law. It's also critical to note that Israel itself [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=126.8s)]
*  has accountability processes to get at this. There are hundreds of ongoing inquiries looking [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=132.32s)]
*  at different incidents that have taken place since October 7th. There are criminal investigations [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=138.4s)]
*  that are going forward. Unlike most other countries in the world, Israel has the ability, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=143.36s)]
*  the means, and the actions to self-correct, but we've been on this every single day. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  So you have been able then to conclude that Israel has violated U.S. laws and weapon-sharing [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=154.8s)]
*  agreements? No, what we've concluded is in the case of the use of weapons, as you said, this is [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  an extraordinarily complex military environment in which you have an enemy, Hamas, that committed [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=168.24s)]
*  the most atrocious terrorist attacks on Israel on October 7th and then retreats to Gaza, hides behind [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=173.84s)]
*  and underneath civilians, hospitals, schools, mosques, apartment buildings, and that makes it [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=180.56s)]
*  very difficult to determine, particularly in the midst of war, exactly what happened and to draw [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=188.24s)]
*  any final conclusions from any one incident. So we have a number of incidents that we continue [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=194.0s)]
*  to look at to try to get the best possible assessment. The Israelis themselves are doing [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=198.48s)]
*  the same thing. Our assessments will be ongoing, but as I said, given the totality of what we've [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=202.88s)]
*  seen in terms of civilian suffering, in terms of children, women, men caught in this crossfire [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=209.2s)]
*  Hamas is making, who've been killed or been injured, it's reasonable to assess that in a [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=215.36s)]
*  number of instances Israel has not acted in a manner that's consistent with internationally [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=219.92s)]
*  humanitarian law. So I understand you're still collecting evidence, but on the policy, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=224.16s)]
*  can you clarify, because even the lead Democrat on House Armed Services says it's not clear, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=231.2s)]
*  is the U.S. slowing down the delivery of any weapons to Israel at this point beyond the 3500 [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  so-called dumb bombs? As you know, Margaret, most of the population from Gaza displaced from [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=244.64s)]
*  the north and from central Gaza has gone to Ra'afe. There are about 1.4 million people there, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  and we've said to Israel that we cannot, will not support an operation in Ra'afe, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=255.27999999999997s)]
*  a major military operation, in the absence of a credible plan to protect civilians. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=259.36s)]
*  And they still haven't delivered it. So are you slowing the delivery of any weapons beyond these [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  3500 bombs? Are you pausing, for example, precision munitions as some Republicans have claimed? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=269.12s)]
*  Right. The answer to that is no. What the president said and what he's been clear about [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=276.88s)]
*  in private conversations with the Israelis, which unfortunately leaked to the press, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=281.12s)]
*  so the president responded forthrightly when he was asked about it, but what we've been clear about [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  is that if Israel launches this major military operation into Ra'afe, then there are certain [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=290.48s)]
*  systems that we're not going to be supporting and supplying for that operation. But at present, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=297.36s)]
*  the only thing that we've delayed and are holding back are these high payload bombs, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  because we're in an ongoing conversation with Israel, given the impact that those weapons can [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=309.44s)]
*  have when they're used in densely populated areas, including an area like Ra'afe. So you still might [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=313.92s)]
*  deliver them. So we're in an active conversation with Israel about that. We have real concerns [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=317.92s)]
*  about the way they're used. But here's something else that's critically important, Margaret. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=323.6s)]
*  We believe two things. One, you have to have a clear, credible plan to protect civilians, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  which we haven't seen. Second, we also need to see a plan for what happens after this conflict in [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=334.64000000000004s)]
*  Gaza is over. And we still haven't seen that, because what are we seeing right now? We're [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=340.48s)]
*  seeing parts of Gaza that Israel has cleared of Hamas, where Hamas is coming back, including in [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=346.0s)]
*  the north, including in Khan Younis. As we look at Ra'afe, they may go in and have some initial [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=352.0s)]
*  success, but potentially at an incredibly high cost to civilians, but one that is not durable, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=359.2s)]
*  one that's not sustainable. And they will be left holding the bag on an enduring insurgency, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=365.68s)]
*  because a lot of armed Hamas will be left, no matter what they do in Ra'afe. Or if they leave [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=370.48s)]
*  and get out of Gaza, as we believe they need to do, then you're going to have a vacuum, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=376.16s)]
*  and a vacuum that's likely to be filled by chaos, by anarchy, and ultimately by Hamas again. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=381.28s)]
*  So we've been working for many, many weeks on developing credible plans for security, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=386.0s)]
*  for governance, for rebuilding. We haven't seen that come from Israel. We've been [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=391.67999999999995s)]
*  working with Arab countries and others on that plan. We need to see that too. We have the same [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=395.67999999999995s)]
*  objective as Israel. We want to make sure that Hamas cannot govern Gaza again. We want to make [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=400.0s)]
*  sure it's demilitarized. We want to make sure that Israel gets its leaders. That's what we're [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=404.96s)]
*  determined to do. We have a different way, and we think a more effective, durable way of getting [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=409.76s)]
*  that done. We remain in conversation with Israel about exactly that. Mr. Secretary, your national [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=414.71999999999997s)]
*  security memorandum that you signed says Israeli civilian harm mitigation efforts are, quote, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  inconsistent, ineffective, and inadequate. The prime minister himself said Israel assesses the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=426.0s)]
*  IDF killed 14,000 terrorists and 16,000 civilians. Does the U.S. share the Israeli assessment that [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=432.0s)]
*  more civilians have been killed than actual terrorists? Yes, we do. And I think the report [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=440.08s)]
*  makes clear that while Israel has processes, procedures, rules, regulations to try to minimize [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=446.4s)]
*  civilian harm, given the impact that this operation, this war in Gaza has had on the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=454.08s)]
*  civilian population, those have not been applied consistently. And effectively, there's a gap [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=459.76s)]
*  between the stated intent and some of the results we've seen. But because it's so complicated, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  in the midst of a war, and particularly in the midst of a war where you have an enemy that hides [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=473.2s)]
*  in civilian infrastructure, hides behind civilians, to make final determinations on these individual [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=477.59999999999997s)]
*  incidents, we're looking at the totality of what's happened. We think it's reasonable to assess based [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=483.52s)]
*  on what's happened that there have been acts that have been inconsistent with Israel's obligations [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=488.64s)]
*  under internationally managed training law. But we haven't drawn definitive conclusions. We need [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=493.36s)]
*  to pursue these investigations just as Israel is doing itself. Mr. Secretary, thank you for your [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=497.2s)]
*  time this morning. Thanks, Margaret. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRDD4J9Pag&t=502.64s)]
