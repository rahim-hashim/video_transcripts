# National security adviser Jake Sullivan meets with Netanyahu
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [December 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc)
*  Well, today, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is in Israel to meet [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=0.0s)]
*  with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  And this comes as his government faces global pressure to do more to protect civilians in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=6.92s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=11.6s)]
*  Yesterday, President Biden met with family members of Americans taken hostage by Hamas. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=12.6s)]
*  The family said they are confident the administration is doing what it can. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  In Gaza, the IDF says its troops have been engaged in close quarters combat in the northern [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=21.64s)]
*  part of the enclave, killing a number of Hamas operatives. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=26.740000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, in the south, the military says that it conducted targeted raids in Khan Yunus, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=29.92s)]
*  destroying tunnel shafts and a weapon storage facility. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=35.08s)]
*  So for more on all of this, let's bring in Ramin Asensio. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=38.72s)]
*  He's following the latest from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  Ramin, it's great to see you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=43.0s)]
*  What can we expect now from Sullivan's meeting with officials in Israel today, especially [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=45.7s)]
*  as tensions are rising between the U.S. and Israel over Netanyahu's handling of the war? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=51.5s)]
*  As you already know, President Biden has been critical lately of Netanyahu's continued [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=57.14s)]
*  or continued approach to the war. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=65.22s)]
*  Absolutely, Enri. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=67.7s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=69.74s)]
*  And the phrase that I think comes to mind for all of us ever since Tuesday when President [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=71.5s)]
*  Biden spoke, it is the phrase indiscriminate bombing, the criticism coming out and that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=75.1s)]
*  that daylight basically being exposed between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Biden. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=80.86s)]
*  Mr. Sullivan's priority here is basically to be that in-person messenger to say to hammer [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=86.17999999999999s)]
*  the message home that Netanyahu and the Israeli War Cabinet needs to change tack, needs to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=92.18s)]
*  be more precise, more surgical in its operations into Gaza. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=97.66s)]
*  We know that the numbers have been climbing so quickly, 18,000 people dead in Gaza, according [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=101.98s)]
*  to the Hamas run health ministry, about 50,000 or more wounded, maybe many more thousands [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=108.46000000000001s)]
*  under the rubble. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=113.3s)]
*  In addition, there is the second priority that Mr. Sullivan is going to try to do. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=114.76s)]
*  You mentioned that meeting that Mr. Biden had with those family members of American [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=119.12s)]
*  hostages. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  There are eight American hostages still believed to be in Gaza. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  The priority there, of course, is to bring them home. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=126.92s)]
*  And Remy, Jake Sullivan met with the Saudi Crown Prince yesterday. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=129.72s)]
*  What can you tell us about that and the discussions that were had there? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=134.22s)]
*  Sure, the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Saudi Arabia has been seen and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=139.76s)]
*  continues to be seen as very integral to maintaining or really reestablishing peace in this region. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  We got to remember too that prior to the October 7 attacks, Saudi Arabia, the kingdom was on [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=153.88s)]
*  a path to normalization with Israel, which would have been a major, major development. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  Some say that Hamas potentially launched its own terror attacks to try to derail that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=165.04s)]
*  But in terms of what they've been talking about, a little bit scarce on the detail, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=169.62s)]
*  but in a White House statement, they said that they talked about efforts to create new [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=173.9s)]
*  conditions for an enduring and sustainable peace and the humanitarian response in Gaza. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=177.54000000000002s)]
*  Now in regards to the hostages, I was under the impression that there were some sort of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=182.54000000000002s)]
*  negotiations that had been going on all along behind the scenes. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=187.02s)]
*  Now we're getting reports that a trip by Israel's foreign intelligence head to Qatar to restart [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=191.70000000000002s)]
*  these talks on a possible second hostage release. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=197.26000000000002s)]
*  That has been canceled. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  What is going on? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=204.56s)]
*  The Mossad chief David Barnea actually offered himself to travel to Qatar in order to start [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=207.72000000000003s)]
*  this second round of hostage negotiations. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=215.08s)]
*  But it's the Israeli war cabinet that basically rejected, declined his offer. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=218.44s)]
*  Now Israeli media is saying that the reason for this is that they don't think that the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=224.26s)]
*  Hamas leadership in Gaza, which of course is separate from the Hamas leadership in Qatar, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=229.58s)]
*  are actually able to communicate during this war. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  We ourselves have heard that because of the war, it's taken maybe a day or longer for [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  messages to get across because of communications blackouts. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=242.34s)]
*  There's also the belief that perhaps the Hamas leadership is not actually ready to talk about [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=245.94s)]
*  these hostage negotiations. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=251.3s)]
*  With that said, the Politburo chief for Hamas, Basin Qatar, Ismail Haniyeh, has said that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=253.1s)]
*  they are open to a ceasefire resolution. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=259.42s)]
*  Another Hamas leader has actually gone as far as to say that they're open to a two-state [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=263.7s)]
*  solution. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=268.26s)]
*  The strange thing there though is that the mission or the charter of Hamas actually says [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=269.26s)]
*  specifically that they want to annihilate Israel, so it's not sure actually if he's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=272.74s)]
*  speaking out of his own personal belief or if it's something that might be a change that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=276.5s)]
*  Hamas is trying to convey. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=281.58000000000004s)]
*  Remy Innocencio live for us from Tel Aviv. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=283.74s)]
*  Remy, thank you as always. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=285.98s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrYfDGxEOJc&t=287.58000000000004s)]
