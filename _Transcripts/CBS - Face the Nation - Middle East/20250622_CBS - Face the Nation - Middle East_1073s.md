# Rubio says U.S. is ready to meet with Iran after strikes, calls closing Strait of Hormuz "suicidal"
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA)
*  Following the U.S. bombing of three nuclear sites in Iran yesterday, Trump administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=0.0s)]
*  officials are breathing a sigh of relief that the highly classified bombing mission appears [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=4.84s)]
*  to have gone off without a hitch. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=10.18s)]
*  But there is also concern now about what happens next when it comes to Iran. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  Operation Midnight Hammer involved top-secret planning and a head fake as two strike forces [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  of B-2 bombers departed the U.S. flying in opposite directions late Friday night. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=23.6s)]
*  On Saturday, defense officials confirmed to CBS News that there were in fact B-2s headed [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=29.98s)]
*  to Guam, flying west from their home in Missouri. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=35.78s)]
*  But those were decoys. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=39.68s)]
*  A separate fleet of B-2s departed from that same location heading east to the targets [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=41.38s)]
*  in Iran. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=46.6s)]
*  Pentagon officials say the mission was an overwhelming success, but also concede it [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=48.1s)]
*  is too early to assess if Iran still has nuclear capability. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=52.82s)]
*  Fourteen 30,000-pound massive Ordnance Penetrator weapons, or MOPs, dropped on an underground [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=57.58s)]
*  nuclear facility in Fordow and a key uranium enrichment site in Natanz. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=64.5s)]
*  Additional American tomahawks struck a third site at Isfahan. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  I think Tehran is certainly calculating the reality that planes flew from the middle of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=74.14s)]
*  America and Missouri overnight, completely undetected over three of their most highly [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=80.18s)]
*  sensitive sites, and we were able to destroy nuclear capabilities. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=84.94s)]
*  We believe that'll have a clear psychological impact on how they view the future. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  At the White House late last night, President Trump issued his own stern warning to Iran. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=93.88s)]
*  There will be either peace or there will be tragedy for Iran, far greater than we have [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=99.88s)]
*  witnessed over the last eight days. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=105.74s)]
*  Remember, there are many targets left. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=108.14s)]
*  Tonight's was the most difficult of them all, by far, and perhaps the most lethal. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=112.22s)]
*  But if peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=118.62s)]
*  speed and skill. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=124.18s)]
*  And those words, go after other targets, have led to confusion and some concern about what [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=127.5s)]
*  is next for the U.S. role in this very volatile crisis. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=133.26s)]
*  Secretary of State and Acting White House National Security Advisor Marco Rubio now [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=137.78s)]
*  joins us. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=141.73999999999998s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, I know it has been an intense few hours, but so far it does not appear that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=143.33999999999997s)]
*  Iran has yet retaliated against the United States. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=150.17999999999998s)]
*  What intelligence do you have at this point about their capabilities to respond, the intent [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=154.82s)]
*  of their proxies? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=161.28s)]
*  Is there any kind of command and control structure left to activate them? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=163.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, well, we'll see what Iran decides to do. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=167.73999999999998s)]
*  I think they should choose the route of peace. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  We have been, we've done everything, we have been over backwards, okay, to create a deal [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=172.73999999999998s)]
*  with these people. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=176.29999999999998s)]
*  Steve, Steve Woodcock has traveled the world extensively, met with them, well, not even [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=177.29999999999998s)]
*  met with them, met through the Omanis with them and discussed back and forth. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=180.94s)]
*  We even put an offer to them that they wanted elements of it in writing, and we offered [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=184.61999999999998s)]
*  it to them. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=188.89999999999998s)]
*  Very generous offer, by the way. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=189.89999999999998s)]
*  We're prepared right now, if they call right now and say we want to meet, let's talk about [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=191.66s)]
*  this, we're prepared to do that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=195.46s)]
*  The president's made that clear from the very beginning. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=196.62s)]
*  His preference is to deal with this issue diplomatically. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=198.9s)]
*  But he also told them we had 60 days to make progress or something else was going to happen. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=202.22s)]
*  And I think they thought they were dealing with a different kind of leader, like the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=206.56s)]
*  kinds of leaders they've been playing games with for the last 30 or 40 years, and they [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=209.36s)]
*  found out that's not the case. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=213.22s)]
*  So this mission was a very precise mission. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=214.98000000000002s)]
*  It had three objectives, three nuclear sites. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=217.66s)]
*  It was not attack on Iran. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=219.7s)]
*  It was not an attack on the Iranian people. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=220.7s)]
*  This wasn't a regime change move. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=223.22s)]
*  This was designed to degrade and or destroy three nuclear sites related to their nuclear [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=224.78s)]
*  weaponization ambitions. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=229.7s)]
*  And that was delivered on yesterday. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  What happens next will now depend on what Iran chooses to do next. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=233.7s)]
*  If they choose the path of diplomacy, we're ready. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=236.85999999999999s)]
*  We can do a deal that's good for them, the Iranian people, and good for the world. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=239.17999999999998s)]
*  If they choose another route, then there'll be consequences for that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=243.42s)]
*  Let me follow up on a phrase you just worded, weaponization ambitions. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=246.85999999999999s)]
*  Are you saying there that the United States did not see intelligence that the Supreme [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=251.42s)]
*  Leader had ordered weaponization? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=256.62s)]
*  That's irrelevant. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=261.42s)]
*  I see that question being asked on the media. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=262.42s)]
*  That's an irrelevant question. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=264.42s)]
*  They have everything they need to build a weapon. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=265.42s)]
*  That is the key point in U.S. intelligence assessments. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=266.42s)]
*  You know that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=267.98s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=268.98s)]
*  Yes, it was. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=269.98s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=270.98s)]
*  That the political decision had not been made. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=271.98s)]
*  Well, I know that better than you know that, and I know that that's not the case. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=272.98s)]
*  But I'm asking you whether the order was given. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=273.98s)]
*  The people who say that, it doesn't matter if the order was given. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=276.7s)]
*  They have everything they need to build nuclear weapons. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=279.34s)]
*  Why would you bury things in a mountain 300 feet under the ground? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=281.26s)]
*  Why would you bury? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=285.7s)]
*  Why do they have 60% enriched uranium? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=286.7s)]
*  You don't need 60% enriched uranium. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=288.9s)]
*  The only countries in the world that have uranium at 60% are countries that have nuclear [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=290.46s)]
*  weapons because it can quickly make it 90. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=294.74s)]
*  They have all the elements. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=297.5s)]
*  Why do they have a space program? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=299.3s)]
*  Is Iran going to go to the moon? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=300.46s)]
*  No. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=301.7s)]
*  They're trying to build an ICBM so they can one day put a warhead on it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=302.7s)]
*  That's a question of intent. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=305.9s)]
*  And you know in the intelligence assessment that it was that Iran wanted to be a threshold [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=306.9s)]
*  seed to use this leverage. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=310.85999999999996s)]
*  How do you know what the intelligence assessment says? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=311.85999999999996s)]
*  I'm talking about the public March assessment. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=312.85999999999996s)]
*  And that's why I was asking you if you know something more from March if an order was [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=315.94s)]
*  given. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=319.62s)]
*  That's also an inaccurate representation of it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=320.62s)]
*  That's an inaccurate representation of it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=321.62s)]
*  That's not how intelligence is read. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=322.7s)]
*  That's not how intelligence is used. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=324.41999999999996s)]
*  Here's what the whole world knows. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=326.26s)]
*  Forget about intelligence. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=327.74s)]
*  What the IAEA knows. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=328.9s)]
*  They are enriching uranium well beyond anything you need for a civil nuclear program. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=330.68s)]
*  So why would you enrich uranium at 60% if you don't intend to one day use it to take [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=337.2s)]
*  it to 90 and build a weapon? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=341.96s)]
*  Why are you developing ICBMs? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=344.16s)]
*  Why do you have 8,000 short-range missiles and 2,000 to 3,000 long mid-range missiles [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=346.0s)]
*  that you continue to develop? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=351.16s)]
*  Why do you do all these things? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=352.98s)]
*  I understand. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=353.98s)]
*  They have everything they need for a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=354.98s)]
*  They have the delivery mechanisms. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=356.52s)]
*  They have the enrichment capability. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=357.52s)]
*  They have the highly enriched uranium that is stored. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=359.47999999999996s)]
*  That's all we need to see. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=361.67999999999995s)]
*  Especially in the hands of a regime that's already involved in terrorism and proxies [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=362.67999999999995s)]
*  and all kinds of things around there. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=367.4s)]
*  They are the source of all of this. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=368.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes, and no one's disputing that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm not doing that here. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  And they were censured at the IAEA for that enrichment and for violating their nonproliferation [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=373.23999999999995s)]
*  agreements. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=378.23999999999995s)]
*  I was simply asking if we had intelligence that there was an order to weaponize because [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=379.23999999999995s)]
*  you said weaponization ambitions. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=383.56s)]
*  We have intelligence that they have everything they need to build a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=385.76s)]
*  And that's more than enough. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=388.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=389.8s)]
*  I want to ask you on the policy front. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=390.8s)]
*  There are personnel throughout the Middle East from the United States, in Bahrain, in [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=393.44s)]
*  Kuwait and other bases. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=396.64s)]
*  If those countries are attacked by Iran because of their association with the United States, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=399.58s)]
*  will the United States defend them? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, that's exactly why they're there. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=406.44s)]
*  That's a great point, actually. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=409.08000000000004s)]
*  Do you know why we have bases in Bahrain and Qatar and UAE and all these places? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=410.08000000000004s)]
*  All of those bases are there because those countries are afraid that Iran will attack [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=415.0s)]
*  them. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=418.2s)]
*  If Iran was not a threat to the region, if the Iranian regime, because I'm talking about [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=419.2s)]
*  the Iranian people, the regime was not a threat to the region, we wouldn't have to have any [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=422.76s)]
*  of these bases. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=426.08s)]
*  Those bases are there because those countries are petrified that the Iranian Shia clerics [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=427.32s)]
*  that run that country will attack their country. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=433.0s)]
*  Will the United States defend them if they are? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=435.32s)]
*  As you know, they've got a very difficult history. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=436.32s)]
*  Well that's why we're there. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=438.28000000000003s)]
*  That's why we're there. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=439.44s)]
*  So yes, we will defend them. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=440.44s)]
*  But they'll attack us is what they're threatening to do. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=441.44s)]
*  So we'll defend our people, obviously. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=442.66s)]
*  We'll defend our people. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=444.68s)]
*  Well, they'll attack our bases. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=445.68s)]
*  And those are our bases. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=447.1s)]
*  And we're going to defend our personnel. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=448.26000000000005s)]
*  We're prepared to do that. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=449.54s)]
*  But we'll do more than just defend. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=450.54s)]
*  We'll impose costs on Iran if they attack American personnel, whether they do it directly [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=452.14000000000004s)]
*  or whether they do it through some of these proxies that they try to hide behind. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=456.58000000000004s)]
*  And that includes the Houthis. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=460.38s)]
*  So another proxy of theirs. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=461.66s)]
*  So let's hope they don't choose that route. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=463.58000000000004s)]
*  Let's all hope that they actually decide, okay, let's go negotiate because we want a [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=465.58000000000004s)]
*  diplomatic and peaceful solution. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=469.14000000000004s)]
*  We have achieved our objectives. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=471.14000000000004s)]
*  We're ready to negotiate this in a peaceful, diplomatic way. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=472.62s)]
*  We've been prepared to do that for days. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=476.1s)]
*  They are the ones that played games. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=477.86s)]
*  As they have done for 40 years, as they have done to multiple presidents, they tried to [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=479.46000000000004s)]
*  play games with President Trump and they see what happens. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=483.54s)]
*  This is not a game playing president. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=486.58000000000004s)]
*  When he says he's going to do something, he will do it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=488.06s)]
*  I hear you saying here you want to deescalate when you are talking about diplomacy. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=490.8s)]
*  You are looking for Iran to pick up that offer that was put on the table you mentioned by [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=495.32000000000005s)]
*  Steve Wittkopf. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=499.38s)]
*  Can you just clarify, does that mean the U.S. would still allow for Iran to have a civilian [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=500.94s)]
*  nuclear program if it does not enrich on its own soil? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=505.66s)]
*  That's never been an issue. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=512.02s)]
*  There are countries all over the world that have a civil nuclear program. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=513.02s)]
*  No one here is saying that Iran can't. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=515.5s)]
*  Any country in the world has a right to have a civil nuclear program. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=519.74s)]
*  What they don't have a right to do is to enrich it at 60%, hide it under a mountain and develop [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=522.26s)]
*  long-range and short-range and mid-range missiles and sponsor terrorist proxies all over the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=526.74s)]
*  world. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=531.0600000000001s)]
*  They don't have a right to do that. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=532.0600000000001s)]
*  And that's what they've been doing. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=533.38s)]
*  And no one has dealt with it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=534.66s)]
*  And it's continued to linger. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=535.66s)]
*  And they've played games with multiple presidents and multiple countries around the world and [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=536.86s)]
*  they've gotten away with it for 40-something years. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=541.22s)]
*  This is very simple. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=543.3s)]
*  The president wants to resolve this diplomatically and peacefully. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  He gave them a chance to do that. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=547.92s)]
*  They delayed, they had all these kind of delayed tactics. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=549.58s)]
*  They wouldn't even meet with us directly. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=551.78s)]
*  We had to go through third countries. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=553.12s)]
*  This is very simple. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=554.72s)]
*  Let's meet directly. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=555.82s)]
*  Let's work on agreements that are good for Iran, good for the Iranian people in particular, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=556.9s)]
*  good for the safety and security of the world and the United States. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=562.42s)]
*  That's always been our preference. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=565.18s)]
*  That continues to be our preference. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=566.58s)]
*  But they're the ones that were playing games with us. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=568.48s)]
*  And these are the consequences. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=570.8s)]
*  We had to achieve those objectives. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=571.9399999999999s)]
*  We had three objectives yesterday, Fordow, Natanz and Esfahan. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=573.38s)]
*  We conducted a brilliant military operation under the command of President Trump and obviously [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=577.18s)]
*  great credit to Secretary Hegseth and General Corilla and General Cain and all of our, all [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=582.26s)]
*  the airmen and the phenomenal people in the U.S. military. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=587.38s)]
*  No other military in the world could have done this. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=589.62s)]
*  No, it was astounding. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=591.38s)]
*  We've achieved those objectives. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=592.38s)]
*  What happens next is up to the regime. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=593.38s)]
*  The regime wants peace. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=594.9399999999999s)]
*  We're ready for peace. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=596.62s)]
*  They want to do something else. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=597.62s)]
*  They're incredibly vulnerable. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=599.14s)]
*  They can't even protect their own airspace. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=600.14s)]
*  Well, clearly, clearly they could not. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=601.58s)]
*  But what is the U.S. assessment of how much nuclear material at those sites was moved [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=604.58s)]
*  prior to the attack? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=608.74s)]
*  There has been talk for days about bombing of Fordow. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=610.22s)]
*  Well, look, we don't, no one will know for sure for days, but I doubt they moved it because [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=613.82s)]
*  anything right now and they can't move anything right now inside of Iran. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=619.74s)]
*  I mean, the minute a truck starts driving somewhere, the Israelis have seen it and they've [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=622.74s)]
*  targeted it and taken it out. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=626.14s)]
*  So our assessment is we have to assume that that's a lot of 60% enriched uranium buried [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=628.42s)]
*  deep under the ground there in Asfahan. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=632.44s)]
*  And that really is the key. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=634.5s)]
*  What they should do with that is they should bring it out of the ground and turn it over. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=635.5s)]
*  Multiple countries around the world will take it and down blend it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=639.38s)]
*  That's what they should do with that. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=641.98s)]
*  And what they should do is say, we're not going to have any enrichment capability in [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=643.1800000000001s)]
*  our country. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=647.44s)]
*  We're going to have what we're going to have is a civil nuclear program like dozens of [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=648.44s)]
*  countries around the world have where we build reactors that create electricity and we import [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=651.1600000000001s)]
*  enriched material. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=656.08s)]
*  And we've made very general, I'm not going to get all the details of the offers, but [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=657.36s)]
*  there are other avenues here that would be acceptable to them. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=660.0400000000001s)]
*  If that's what they wanted, if what they want is a civil, peaceful nuclear program, the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=662.7600000000001s)]
*  route has always been there. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=667.08s)]
*  The problem is that everything they're demanding has nothing to do with a peaceful program. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=668.4000000000001s)]
*  They are all the things you would want if you want to retain the option of one day weaponizing [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=672.84s)]
*  the program, which has been their clear intent. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=677.0s)]
*  To me, that's indisputable. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=679.72s)]
*  I followed this issue for 15 years, including the intelligence on it for 15 years. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=680.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=684.72s)]
*  I have followed it and the intelligence, these are assessments and sometimes they've been [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=685.72s)]
*  wrong. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=688.72s)]
*  I've seen them revised multiple times. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=689.72s)]
*  These guys want a nuclear weapon one day. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=690.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=692.64s)]
*  To that point. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=693.64s)]
*  And it isn't going to happen. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=694.64s)]
*  Not while Donald Trump is president. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=695.64s)]
*  Understood. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=696.64s)]
*  You've said this is not about regime change, but you were describing a regime that you [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=697.64s)]
*  have said for decades, I mean, for upwards of 40 years has chanted death to America, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=699.9200000000001s)]
*  as in all the things you just described. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=704.76s)]
*  Isn't a diplomatic deal with them a lifeline? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=707.8s)]
*  Aren't you offering to negotiate with the same people you're saying did all these things? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=710.72s)]
*  So therefore, are you actually looking for regime change? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=713.96s)]
*  That misses the point. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=719.92s)]
*  I don't like that they chant those things, but one thing is that they chant those things. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=720.92s)]
*  Another thing is that they chant those things and they have terror proxies are all over [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=724.42s)]
*  the world and they have long range missiles that can reach the United States one day and [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=728.4399999999999s)]
*  they have the potential to be one step away from a nuclear weapon. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=732.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=736.04s)]
*  Well, one day could be tomorrow, could be a week from now, could be a month from now. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=737.04s)]
*  All it takes is the flip of a switch. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=740.68s)]
*  By the way, they're not going to broadcast that to the world. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=742.16s)]
*  By the time we figure out that they're doing it, you have all the pieces in place. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=744.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=747.36s)]
*  It's like you have a loaded, a gun here and the ammunition. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=748.36s)]
*  It only takes one second. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=750.92s)]
*  We have other targets that we could hit, but we achieved our objective. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=752.24s)]
*  The primary targets we were interested in are the ones that were struck tonight in devastating [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=755.14s)]
*  fashion. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=759.24s)]
*  We've achieved that objective. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=760.72s)]
*  There are no planned military operations right now against Iran unless they mess around and [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=761.72s)]
*  they attack American or American interests. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=767.72s)]
*  Then they're going to have a problem. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=769.72s)]
*  Then they're going to have a problem and I'm not going to broadcast what those problems [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=771.72s)]
*  are. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=773.72s)]
*  Suffice it to say, know this, the United States flew halfway around the world right into the [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=774.72s)]
*  heart of Iran over their most sensitive locations. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=778.72s)]
*  These things got rocked and then we left and we were out of their airspace. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=781.72s)]
*  We were over the ocean before they got there. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=785.72s)]
*  Understood. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=788.2s)]
*  We don't want to do that. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=789.2s)]
*  That's not our preference. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=790.2s)]
*  We want peace deals with them and that's up to them to decide. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=791.2s)]
*  You said defend American interests. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=794.2s)]
*  Would the United States military take action to keep, for example, the transit point, the [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=795.2s)]
*  Strait of Hormuz open? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=800.2s)]
*  If there are attacks on oil installations, would the United States consider that a direct [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=801.2s)]
*  act by the state, even if it was carried out by a militia? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=806.2s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to take options away from the president. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=809.2s)]
*  That's not something we're talking about right now in the United States. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=812.2s)]
*  That's not something we're talking about right now in terms of being immediate. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=815.6800000000001s)]
*  But if they do that, the first people that should be angry about it are the Chinese government [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=818.6800000000001s)]
*  because they take a lot of their oil comes through there. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=821.84s)]
*  So they should be the first ones that are saying if they mine the Straits of Hormuz, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=823.9200000000001s)]
*  the Chinese are going to pay a huge price and every other country in the world is going [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=827.24s)]
*  to pay a huge price. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=830.2s)]
*  We will too. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=831.2s)]
*  It'll have some impact on us. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=832.2s)]
*  It'll have a lot more impact on the rest of the world, a lot more impact on the rest of [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=833.2s)]
*  the world. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=836.96s)]
*  There would be a suicidal move on their part because I think the whole world would come [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=837.96s)]
*  against them if they did that. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=840.38s)]
*  Will the Chinese and Russians stop trading with Iran? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=841.92s)]
*  You have to ask the Chinese and the Russians. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=844.4399999999999s)]
*  You haven't asked them? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=847.76s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=848.76s)]
*  I mean, they're getting, you know, well, the Russians are getting a bunch of these drones [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=849.76s)]
*  that they're using are coming from Iran. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=853.16s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=854.7199999999999s)]
*  They're coming from Iran. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=855.7199999999999s)]
*  So I saw the foreign minister instead of meeting with Steve Woodcock is headed to Moscow to [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=856.7199999999999s)]
*  meet with Putin, which was a pre-scheduled meeting, which is fine. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=859.8s)]
*  You know, they can go meet. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=862.92s)]
*  And you know, the Russians at the end of the day, I mean, they buy drones from them. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=864.2199999999999s)]
*  But look, this is very simple. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=868.76s)]
*  We want to have an agreement with them, a diplomatic agreement in which they have a [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=871.76s)]
*  civil nuclear program, but are not enriching and don't have weapons grade material or weapons [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=875.3199999999999s)]
*  grade capabilities laying around. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=879.92s)]
*  That's that simple. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=881.64s)]
*  That's our interest here. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=882.64s)]
*  Understood. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=883.64s)]
*  Who they trade with, who they deal with. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=884.64s)]
*  Those are other topics. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=885.84s)]
*  Our objective here is very straightforward. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=886.98s)]
*  They're not going to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=888.96s)]
*  They're not even going to get close to a nuclear weapon. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=890.48s)]
*  They're not even going to be in the neighborhood of a nuclear weapon because these people are [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=892.52s)]
*  dangerous. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=895.56s)]
*  This is a radical Shia clerics who run that country and they are the source of all instability [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=896.56s)]
*  in the region. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=901.68s)]
*  All of it. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=902.68s)]
*  Without Iran and this regime, there is no Hamas. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=903.68s)]
*  There is no Hezbollah. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=905.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, because we don't want them to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=906.8399999999999s)]
*  Okay, but that's the core objective. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=908.9599999999999s)]
*  But no, no, but I'm going through the things they've done because that's why they can't [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=911.0s)]
*  have a nuclear weapon. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=914.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=915.12s)]
*  They sponsor Shias. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=916.12s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just trying to- [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=917.12s)]
*  I'm sorry, they sponsor these Shia militias, Hamas, Hezbollah, all these other terrorist [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=918.12s)]
*  groups. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=920.8s)]
*  These people are never going to get anywhere close to a nuclear weapon. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=921.8s)]
*  Not while Donald Trump is president. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=924.64s)]
*  For the Americans at home who are going, are we at war? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=925.92s)]
*  You know, I'm trying to suss out some of the facts here. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=929.5999999999999s)]
*  So why would Iran agree to any peace deal if the United States has already pulled out [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=931.88s)]
*  of one that they had, as President Trump did in 2018, and now launched two surprise attacks, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=938.76s)]
*  both Israel and the United States have done so? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=944.68s)]
*  There is such a massive trust deficit there. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=947.28s)]
*  How could you possibly come to it if- [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=950.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but the trust deficit started with Iran. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=951.7199999999999s)]
*  I know. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=953.92s)]
*  Well, the trust deficit, the ones that shouldn't be trusted are the Iranians because they're [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=954.92s)]
*  the ones that sponsor terrorism. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=957.1199999999999s)]
*  The day four warned us before they blew up the embassy in Lebanon and killed over 200 [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=958.56s)]
*  American servicemen. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=962.5999999999999s)]
*  The day four warned us before they built IEDs and blew the legs and arms off of American [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=963.5999999999999s)]
*  servicemen in Iraq. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=967.4s)]
*  I mean, these are the people that are doing this forever. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=968.4s)]
*  They're the ones that no one should trust. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=970.76s)]
*  They're the ones that have lied about their nuclear program. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=972.3199999999999s)]
*  They're the ones that have hidden things from the international organisms. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=974.0799999999999s)]
*  But that sounds like we're headed towards regime change, or the desire to get these [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=977.1199999999999s)]
*  people out of power. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=981.76s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=982.76s)]
*  Are you- [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=983.76s)]
*  No, no. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=984.76s)]
*  I'm not the one that's focused on identifying what our national interest is. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=986.76s)]
*  You don't have to like the regime. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=988.68s)]
*  There are a lot of regimes around the world that we don't like, okay? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=989.68s)]
*  But in this particular case, what we are focused on is not the changing of the regime. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=992.42s)]
*  Okay, that's up to the Iranian people if they want to do that, but that's not what we're [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=996.6s)]
*  focused on. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=999.56s)]
*  Our national interest is about one thing, and that is Iran not getting anywhere near [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1000.56s)]
*  the capability to weaponize and have nuclear weapons. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1005.52s)]
*  They're not going to get anywhere near that capability. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1008.92s)]
*  The president has made that clear from day one. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1010.96s)]
*  Our preference for solving that problem, that very specific problem, is through diplomacy. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1013.36s)]
*  We've said that. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1018.24s)]
*  We've given it every opportunity. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1019.24s)]
*  They played games. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1020.42s)]
*  They tried delay tactics. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1021.48s)]
*  They're trying delay tactics now on the Europeans because of the snapback provisions. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1022.72s)]
*  When did the president- [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1026.68s)]
*  And you talk about the JCPOA. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1027.68s)]
*  That was a crazy deal. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1028.68s)]
*  When did the president make this decision? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1030.32s)]
*  Because he said he was giving two more weeks of diplomacy on Friday, and on Friday these [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1031.84s)]
*  jets took off. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1035.32s)]
*  Well, the president retains the opportunity to pull out of this at any moment, including [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1036.84s)]
*  10 minutes before. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1041.24s)]
*  The president ordered options. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1042.96s)]
*  Look, the decision, in my view, was made when he wrote a letter to the Supreme Leader, and [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1044.68s)]
*  he said over the next 60 days, we want to do a deal with you and solve this problem [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1048.6399999999999s)]
*  of nuclear weaponization. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1052.34s)]
*  We want to do it peacefully. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1053.34s)]
*  If after 60 days we don't see progress or it isn't solved, we have other alternatives. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ehOgu5cnTA&t=1054.8799999999999s)]
