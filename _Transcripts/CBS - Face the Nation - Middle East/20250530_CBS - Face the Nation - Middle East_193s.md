# Hamas says it's reviewing Gaza ceasefire proposal backed by Israel
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM)
*  The US has confirmed this morning that it is reviewing the latest peace proposal backed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=0.0s)]
*  by both the United States and Israel, but the group added it may not be enough for them [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=4.24s)]
*  to accept it in its current form. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  CBS News reporter Haley Ott is monitoring the situation for us from London. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=10.56s)]
*  Haley, good to see you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=15.08s)]
*  So what else did the group say about whether it will accept this peace proposal if there [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=16.8s)]
*  are any issues that they see? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=21.2s)]
*  As you know, these negotiations oftentimes lead to moments where one side says, well, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=25.98s)]
*  wait a second, I want to add something or I want to remove something. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=31.22s)]
*  Are we to understand that Hamas is absolutely fine with this proposal that is backed by [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=34.78s)]
*  both the US and Israel? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=38.88s)]
*  Hamas says it's reviewing this proposal and it's already raised some concerns. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=41.9s)]
*  As you say, these deals are being worked out until they are signed, and we're very much [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=45.82s)]
*  in that moment right now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=50.64s)]
*  The concerns that Hamas has raised have to do with two of its main demands, one that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=53.34s)]
*  there be a permanent end to the war in Gaza and the other that there be the full withdrawal [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=58.220000000000006s)]
*  of Israeli troops. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=63.540000000000006s)]
*  Nevertheless, a statement put out by Hamas this morning said that the situation was so [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=65.26s)]
*  grave in Gaza that Hamas was very seriously considering this deal because it would mean [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=69.82000000000001s)]
*  ceasefire and it would mean the flow or more unrestricted or less restricted flow of aid [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=77.7s)]
*  into the Gaza Strip, which is so necessary for the population there at the moment. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=83.94s)]
*  Hallie, the other thing is we heard from a UN official today on the conflicting reports [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=88.34s)]
*  about the aid situation in Gaza. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=92.94s)]
*  What did we learn? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=95.7s)]
*  So the UN's humanitarian office today called Gaza the hungriest place on earth. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=98.06s)]
*  They said that only a trickle of aid has made it in since Israel lifted its complete blockade [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=104.3s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip and much of that food aid isn't food that's ready to eat. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=108.82s)]
*  It's some stuff like flour which needs to be prepared. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=112.86s)]
*  And another thing that there are shortages of in Gaza are fuel, so that is difficult. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=115.86s)]
*  The Red Cross has said that half of its medical facilities are closed because of a lack of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=121.22s)]
*  medicine and also fuel. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=124.94s)]
*  So there's a really dire humanitarian situation on the ground in Gaza right now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=126.94s)]
*  We've also heard today from this private foundation called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=130.82s)]
*  which is backed by the United States and Israel, which started operating on the ground in Gaza [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=136.82s)]
*  this week. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=141.66s)]
*  They said that they distributed about 2.1 million meals to people in Gaza this week [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=142.7s)]
*  and that everything had gone well. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=147.78s)]
*  They said there were no injuries and they were going to continue to scale their operations. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=151.52s)]
*  That doesn't correspond with videos that CBS has verified from Gaza, which appear to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=156.8s)]
*  show chaos scenes of crowds who are desperate for food gathering around these distribution [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=163.68s)]
*  centers, which all goes to say just what a serious humanitarian situation it is in Gaza [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=172.12s)]
*  at the moment. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  And we've heard today that there are further Israeli strikes on Gaza City this morning. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  So the war is very much still ongoing there. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=185.48s)]
*  All right, Haley Ott reporting from London for us this morning. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=188.72s)]
*  Thank you, Haley. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictXvZ0bXM&t=191.88s)]
