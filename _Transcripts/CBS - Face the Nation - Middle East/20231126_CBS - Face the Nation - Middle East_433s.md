# Hamas could release American hostage today, Jake Sullivan says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ)
*  A source with knowledge tells CBS that a group of hostages was just handed over to the Red [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Cross. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=7.12s)]
*  We'll be following that. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  We spoke earlier this morning with White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan before [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=9.46s)]
*  the prime minister and asked him whether the U.S. could confirm Americans are on the list [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=14.32s)]
*  to be released. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=19.44s)]
*  Well, Margaret, we do have reason to believe that Americans will be released today. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=20.92s)]
*  At least one American will be released today. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=26.44s)]
*  I cannot confirm who it will be or that it will absolutely happen because until we see [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=28.64s)]
*  that American out of Gaza in safety and ultimately in the hands of their loved ones, we won't [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=37.52s)]
*  have full confirmation. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=43.44s)]
*  And so we have been in close touch with the Israeli authorities, with Qatar, with Egypt, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=44.92s)]
*  and we do have reason to believe that there will be an American release today. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  But let's wait and see what actually happens because, of course, we are dealing with the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=53.88s)]
*  terrorist group here and we can't immediately trust we have to verify. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=58.12s)]
*  Understood. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  But as part of that diplomacy, this is that delicate exchange, Palestinian prisoners, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=64.2s)]
*  aid going in. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=70.24s)]
*  Are all those other pieces on track today? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=71.24s)]
*  Well, there continues to be quite a bit of intensity around the logistics of the delivery [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  of humanitarian assistance. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=79.97999999999999s)]
*  That humanitarian assistance is flowing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=82.2s)]
*  It has been flowing for several hours this morning. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  The Israelis have indicated the list of Palestinian prisoners they're prepared to release, so [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=86.64s)]
*  that should be on track. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=90.84s)]
*  We have every reason to believe that this will come together again today. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=92.68s)]
*  It has for the last two days. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=95.56s)]
*  But implementation of something as intricate and complicated as this is difficult. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=97.32s)]
*  I know this first phase of the deals focused on women and children. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=102.0s)]
*  There are 10 Americans unaccounted for at this point. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=105.66s)]
*  Do you anticipate this truce will be extended and that all the Americans, including the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=109.64s)]
*  men, will come home? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=115.2s)]
*  I have every confidence that ultimately all of the Americans and all of the individuals [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=117.52s)]
*  being held hostage will come home. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=122.68s)]
*  We are determined not to rest until that happens. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=124.5s)]
*  But whether or not this particular deal gets extended, that's really up to Hamas because [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  Israel has been very clear as part of the deal. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=132.54s)]
*  It is prepared to continue the pause in fighting for every day that Hamas produces an additional [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=134.84s)]
*  10 hostages. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=140.68s)]
*  So the ball is in Hamas' court. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=141.68s)]
*  If Hamas chooses on the fifth day and the sixth day and the seventh day to continue [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=143.4s)]
*  to produce hostages, to return them to their loved ones, to return them to safety, then [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=147.96s)]
*  Israel is prepared to continue the pause in the fighting. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  If Hamas decides not to do it, the responsibility will rest squarely on Hamas' shoulders. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  Your deputy, John Feiner, was on Face the Nation last Sunday and told us Israel believes [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=161.96s)]
*  Hamas leaders are hiding in the south of Gaza. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=166.0s)]
*  Combat operations are planned for that area. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=169.28s)]
*  He said they should be held off until civilians are accounted for in Israel's military planning. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=171.58s)]
*  Is the U.S. satisfied with the assurances provided by Israel? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=178.14000000000001s)]
*  Well, really, this is about operations and not just about conversations. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  So what the United States is hoping to see, and frankly what I believe Israel is hoping [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=188.38s)]
*  to see, is the conditions being set whereby any military action only takes place after [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=192.82s)]
*  civilians have been accounted for and have the opportunity to be in safety, to have access [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=199.56s)]
*  to humanitarian assistance, and to be out of the way of any military operation that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=205.44s)]
*  is conducted. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=210.2s)]
*  That's the conversation we're having with the Israelis right now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=211.48s)]
*  It's a constructive conversation, and the details of it will remain behind closed doors. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=214.42s)]
*  But the basic notion that continuing military operations should learn lessons from the north [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=218.67999999999998s)]
*  to be applied in any further undertakings, this is something that we have been discussing [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=223.92s)]
*  with the Israelis at length. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  President Biden was asked this past week about the call by some of his fellow Democrats to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=230.8s)]
*  put conditions on military aid to Israel, and he said it was, quote, a worthwhile thought. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=236.6s)]
*  What specific conditions are you considering putting on U.S. aid? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, Margaret, what the president actually said was it's a worthwhile thought, but the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=247.08s)]
*  approach that I've taken, I, Joe Biden, have taken has actually helped generate results. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=252.28s)]
*  It has been high-level presidential diplomacy, deep, personal, and oftentimes private engagement. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=257.32s)]
*  Well, he said it wouldn't have gotten us where we are now. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=260.64s)]
*  That has led to a deep, personal, and private engagement that has led to a substantial and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=264.3s)]
*  increasing amount of humanitarian assistance going into Gaza, thousands of foreign nationals, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=270.24s)]
*  including American citizens, being able to depart safely from Gaza, a pause in the fighting [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=275.0s)]
*  for the first time since the conflict began, and a hostage deal that is bringing hostages [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=279.76s)]
*  home to their loved ones after 50 days. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=284.74s)]
*  That has all been the result of what President Biden has described as the approach that he [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=287.3s)]
*  has taken in this conflict. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=291.58s)]
*  And when he answered that question, he acknowledged the idea, but then he said in the same breath [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=293.26s)]
*  that the approach that he has taken is what has been generating results. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=299.38s)]
*  Are you saying that what the president was indicating was no, there won't be any restrictions? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=302.82s)]
*  No, we all saw what he said. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=309.58s)]
*  He acknowledged the idea. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=311.74s)]
*  So there might be restrictions? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=312.74s)]
*  And then he said, but the approach I'm taking. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=314.02s)]
*  Margaret, the president made clear in his comments that he thought the approach that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=317.29999999999995s)]
*  he is taking is the approach that has generated the results that we have seen so far. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=321.94s)]
*  And he is going to continue to engage in exactly that kind of diplomacy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=326.79999999999995s)]
*  In fact, he has a call set up for today with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=331.5s)]
*  And I think you will see the United States continue to do what we have been doing, and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=335.34s)]
*  President Biden continue to do what he is doing because that is what is generating results. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=340.3s)]
*  OK, because Senator Sanders has an op-ed in The New York Times making very specific demands [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=345.02s)]
*  in terms of restrictions on aid, saying there should be a freeze on settlement expansion [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=350.90000000000003s)]
*  in the West Bank, a commitment to a two-state solution. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=355.58s)]
*  Are those reasonable things to require of the Israeli government before additional aid [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=359.54s)]
*  is handed over? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=365.3s)]
*  Nobody has been a stronger advocate for a two-state solution than President Joe Biden, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=366.94s)]
*  who has been speaking about it from the beginning of this conflict. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=372.34s)]
*  Understood, and the current Israeli government has not been. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=374.46s)]
*  And has done so publicly as well as privately. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=376.86s)]
*  And as far as the president is concerned, this is the sine qua non of a lasting peace [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=380.46s)]
*  in the region. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=385.34s)]
*  We need to see a two-state solution, Israelis and Palestinians in equal measures of freedom [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=386.34s)]
*  and dignity, living side by side, one another in peace. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=391.62s)]
*  Do you think this is a moment for that diplomacy, given what Prime Minister Netanyahu has said, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=394.72s)]
*  given what some members of his government have said? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=400.88000000000005s)]
*  We believe that this is absolutely a moment for us to be working with everyone in the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=404.56s)]
*  region, the Israeli government, Palestinians, Arab countries, our European partners, others, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=410.32000000000005s)]
*  towards a two-state solution. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=417.48s)]
*  And President Biden laid that out in detail in an op-ed that he wrote in The Washington [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=418.48s)]
*  Post not long ago. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=423.08000000000004s)]
*  The answer to your question is yes, we do think this is a moment for that kind of diplomacy. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=425.16s)]
*  Jake Sullivan, thank you for your time this morning. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=429.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB-yyQoLOQ&t=432.24s)]
