# Margaret Brennan unpacks the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage release deal
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ)
*  Tonight on America Decides, deal reached. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=0.0s)]
*  From Tel Aviv to Gaza, people gather [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=3.64s)]
*  as the Middle East moves a step closer to peace. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=5.8s)]
*  The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=9.28s)]
*  and the role that the Biden and Trump officials played [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=11.88s)]
*  in making it happen. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  There was no other way for this war to end [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=17.16s)]
*  than with a hostage deal. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=20.36s)]
*  And I'm deeply satisfied. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=22.28s)]
*  This day has come, finally come. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=24.52s)]
*  President Biden will take to the airwaves again tonight [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=27.56s)]
*  for a prime time address from the White House, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=30.16s)]
*  capping a five decade political career. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=33.16s)]
*  And from Florida into the fray, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=36.4s)]
*  Trump's cabinet pick for Secretary of State Marco Rubio, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  the Senator from Florida and Attorney General nominee [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=41.96s)]
*  Pam Bondi, both faced Senate confirmation hearings. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=44.8s)]
*  Tonight we start with CBS News Chief [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=48.6s)]
*  Foreign Affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=50.92s)]
*  for the latest on the ceasefire agreement. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=53.28s)]
*  Margaret, thank you for being here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=55.56s)]
*  I know you've been reporting on this all day, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=56.82s)]
*  talking to all the officials involved. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=58.42s)]
*  I wanna talk about the implementation of this in a moment, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=60.660000000000004s)]
*  but let's first start with what exactly this deal is [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=63.7s)]
*  and really how it came together. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=67.62s)]
*  Well, everything really came together [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=70.1s)]
*  within the last 96 hours. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=72.14s)]
*  But this goes back to the framework [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=74.66s)]
*  that President Biden stood up and laid out publicly [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=76.66s)]
*  in May, at the end of May. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=79.7s)]
*  So that's been floating out there. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=81.94s)]
*  But the momentum behind the diplomacy [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=83.4s)]
*  really happened after the election. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=86.02000000000001s)]
*  President Biden, for him, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=88.78s)]
*  foreign policy is a huge part of his legacy [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=91.22s)]
*  and he wanted to get a ceasefire deal. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=93.30000000000001s)]
*  He deployed his diplomats to the region, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=95.7s)]
*  both to get a ceasefire in Lebanon [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=97.38000000000001s)]
*  and also to push on the hostages. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=99.06s)]
*  All of this started picking up momentum very recently. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=101.54s)]
*  Brett McGurk is the top White House advisor to Joe Biden. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  He sent him to Doha and he's been there for weeks. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=108.94s)]
*  Within the last 96 hours or so, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=112.26s)]
*  Donald Trump, the President-elect, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=115.54s)]
*  sent his envoy, Steve Witkoff, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=117.94000000000001s)]
*  to be really working with him arm in arm. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=119.94000000000001s)]
*  A senior administration official [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=123.02000000000001s)]
*  was briefing reporters earlier today [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=125.34s)]
*  and said the origins of that partnership [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=127.26s)]
*  really came out of that Oval Office meeting [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=129.46s)]
*  between President Biden and President-elect Trump [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=131.3s)]
*  recently where he said, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=134.06s)]
*  it's in the interest of the country [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  to get this peace deal, help support here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=136.82s)]
*  It's to show that there can't be a fissure [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=139.66s)]
*  that could be exploited by Hamas or Israel there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  Long story short, fast forward to what came together [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=145.22s)]
*  within the last few hours. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=147.3s)]
*  And there were some 11th hour hiccups, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=148.9s)]
*  but ultimately this was announced. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=150.42000000000002s)]
*  It's interesting that we saw these two teams [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=152.5s)]
*  working together seemingly so seamlessly. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=154.74s)]
*  Witkoff was telling us at Mar-a-Lago last week [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=158.1s)]
*  he was praising the Biden administration [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=160.66s)]
*  for bringing him in. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=162.62s)]
*  But he also said that he thought that Trump deserved, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=164.58s)]
*  his persistence here and his persona in his words [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  really helped to drive these negotiations. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=172.18s)]
*  And I'm curious if there is any truth to that, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=174.22s)]
*  if Trump does deserve some of the credit here. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=177.26s)]
*  Well, in terms of the structure of the diplomacy, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=180.66s)]
*  the details, the sequencing, all that work, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=183.02s)]
*  that was diplomats for months and weeks, right? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=185.82s)]
*  And so it was sort of the closing element [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=189.18s)]
*  where I'm told by my sources [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  that Steve Witkoff really became very useful [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=193.66s)]
*  and the threat of Donald Trump coming to office became useful, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=196.3s)]
*  particularly to the more and more right-wing Israeli government. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=200.42s)]
*  For Benjamin Netanyahu to hear after defying Joe Biden [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=204.45999999999998s)]
*  for the better part of the past year and a half, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=208.5s)]
*  that Donald Trump actually wants him to do something [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=210.7s)]
*  and to have him send his envoy from Florida to Israel, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=213.73999999999998s)]
*  as he did over the weekend to get that message, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=217.45999999999998s)]
*  was received differently. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=220.66s)]
*  And for Hamas, they've been under increased pressure as well. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=222.17999999999998s)]
*  Don't forget the other element, Yahya Sinwar, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=225.66s)]
*  the architect of that horrific attack on October 7th [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=228.01999999999998s)]
*  is off the battlefield. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=230.57999999999998s)]
*  There have been dynamics in this conflict [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=232.34s)]
*  that have changed dramatically. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=234.38s)]
*  It's his brother who accepted this deal, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=235.82s)]
*  and he was strong-armed into it by Israel and by Egypt and Qatar. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=238.01999999999998s)]
*  But the dynamic on the ground has changed. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=242.57999999999998s)]
*  The closing element of having Donald Trump say, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=244.94s)]
*  I want this to really did help. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=247.26s)]
*  Apply the pressure. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=248.85999999999999s)]
*  And then, obviously, we have the deal. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=250.01999999999998s)]
*  Implementing it is a whole other story. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=252.22s)]
*  What are the kind of complications [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=254.42s)]
*  or challenges ahead for this? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=256.3s)]
*  Well, just tomorrow in Cairo, Egypt, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=259.26s)]
*  they will have an implementation meeting [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=261.74s)]
*  to talk through the very difficult part [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=264.34s)]
*  of seeing this through. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=266.7s)]
*  So, an agreement on paper, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=268.1s)]
*  it's only worth the paper it's written on, right? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=270.02s)]
*  You have to see people follow through with it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=272.46s)]
*  Also, within Israel, you have the political dynamic [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=274.54s)]
*  that is very complicated. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=277.65999999999997s)]
*  The prime minister under increased pressure [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=279.21999999999997s)]
*  from within his right wing, just within the past few days, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=281.1s)]
*  some members of his coalition have threatened [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=283.5s)]
*  to collapse his government if he agreed to a peace deal, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=285.82s)]
*  because they are from that element within Israel [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=289.09999999999997s)]
*  that believe Gaza should not be under Palestinian control [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=292.41999999999996s)]
*  but rather should be annexed, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  who don't want to give an inch. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=297.21999999999997s)]
*  You have the left wanting the hostages back [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=299.06s)]
*  and just an end to the fighting. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=301.14s)]
*  So, Benjamin Netanyahu is in the middle of this [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=302.58s)]
*  and ultimately came to the agreement, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=305.14s)]
*  but the process is still not certain. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=307.06s)]
*  He has to get this deal approved by his cabinet, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=309.9s)]
*  by the Knesset, their version of a parliament, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=312.78s)]
*  and we may see some legal challenges, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=315.05999999999995s)]
*  I'm told by my sources, in the coming days, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=316.78s)]
*  particularly when that list of Palestinian prisoners [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=318.61999999999995s)]
*  who will be released, hundreds of them, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=321.05999999999995s)]
*  from Israeli detention centers, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=322.82s)]
*  that may go through some legal challenges. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=324.61999999999995s)]
*  But it was all signed off on by the Israeli Security Cabinet. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=326.78s)]
*  All right, a lot to look forward. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=330.58s)]
*  Good news, but we'll see how it gets implemented. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=332.26s)]
*  Margaret Brennan, thank you. A very big deal. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=334.9s)]
*  A very big deal. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=336.02s)]
*  Thank you very much for your reporting. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=336.73999999999995s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=338.05999999999995s)]
*  White House National Security Communications Advisor [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=339.97999999999996s)]
*  John Kirby is with us now. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=342.7s)]
*  Mr. Kirby, great to see you. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=344.97999999999996s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=346.26s)]
*  This is all, of course, fantastic news. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=347.58s)]
*  I'm curious, though, how confident are you [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=351.14s)]
*  that both sides will be able to abide by this agreement? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=354.18s)]
*  Because implementation of this will be the challenge. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=357.94s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=363.41999999999996s)]
*  Now comes the real hard work of putting the modalities [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=364.7s)]
*  of the plan in place and executing to it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=368.26s)]
*  Over the course of the weeks and months ahead. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=370.54s)]
*  And that's going to be tough work. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=373.18s)]
*  The president said today that he's confident it can [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=375.7s)]
*  and will be implemented. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=378.46s)]
*  And he knows, because we've been in touch [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=380.18s)]
*  with the incoming Trump team, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=381.86s)]
*  how seriously they're taking this. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=382.86s)]
*  They know that they're now going to be responsible [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=384.98s)]
*  for implementation, which is why we wanted them [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=387.02s)]
*  informed from the very, very beginning [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=389.02s)]
*  of what was being negotiated. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=391.22s)]
*  And we're confident that they certainly have the experience [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=393.78s)]
*  and the wisdom now. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=397.26s)]
*  They certainly know enough about the deal [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=398.66s)]
*  that they can carry it through. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=401.02000000000004s)]
*  And obviously, it's going to require commitments [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=402.22s)]
*  by all sides, by the Israelis, by Hamas, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=404.5s)]
*  certainly our partners in the region, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=407.42s)]
*  who will be also monitoring implementation. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=409.38000000000005s)]
*  A lot of hard work ahead, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=411.98s)]
*  but we're confident that it can be done. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=413.1s)]
*  And there are Americans, of course, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=415.90000000000003s)]
*  being held hostage as well. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=418.14000000000004s)]
*  Do we know how many Americans are going to be released? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=419.82000000000005s)]
*  When will we see them returned? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=424.3s)]
*  Well, I don't want to get into too much detail at this time [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=428.78000000000003s)]
*  as we work out these final steps [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=431.70000000000005s)]
*  towards implementation starting this weekend. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=434.58000000000004s)]
*  But we do know that there will be Americans, more than one, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=436.74s)]
*  in the first tranche that come out. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=441.1s)]
*  And again, I want to stress that the first tranche [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=443.98s)]
*  is going to be focused on women, the elderly, the sick, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=448.22s)]
*  the injured, the most at risk. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=453.06s)]
*  And so we know that there are Americans in that group, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=456.34000000000003s)]
*  but it won't be all of the Americans in that group. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=459.82s)]
*  So, but we can say for sure that some Americans [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=462.54s)]
*  will come out in this first tranche. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=465.94s)]
*  That is great news. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=468.1s)]
*  And I want to ask, because you mentioned, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=469.5s)]
*  obviously, President-elect Trump will be president [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=471.38s)]
*  once the ceasefire has ended, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=474.3s)]
*  so they've been part of this negotiation for a while now. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=476.98s)]
*  We saw that Trump's Middle East envoy, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=481.5s)]
*  Steve Wicoff, was in Doha working on these negotiations. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=483.98s)]
*  How much credit do you think that Trump should get [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=489.02s)]
*  for this successful negotiation? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=493.54s)]
*  Well, first of all, I would hope we would all move [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=498.94s)]
*  beyond the question of who gets credit. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=501.42s)]
*  I mean, I don't think that the hostages [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=503.62s)]
*  are caring about that, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=505.9s)]
*  and I don't think their families care about that. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=506.9s)]
*  I don't think the Palestinians in Gaza [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=508.58s)]
*  care about who gets credit for this. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=510.74s)]
*  The truth is that there's a lot of credit to go around, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=512.5s)]
*  including in the region. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=516.46s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu, who made some courageous decisions, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=518.02s)]
*  Egyptians, the Qataris, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=521.34s)]
*  and certainly here in the United States. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=523.1s)]
*  It's important to remember that this deal [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=525.38s)]
*  was the deal that President Biden negotiated [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=527.02s)]
*  and put on the table back in May, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=529.46s)]
*  got international support for it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=531.42s)]
*  That's the deal that we're talking about [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=532.9s)]
*  being implemented here coming forward, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=534.54s)]
*  and it was due to a lot of intense diplomacy [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=536.26s)]
*  by American diplomats since May to now. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=538.3s)]
*  It also was a result of the work that the IDF did [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=541.5s)]
*  to decimate Hamas's military power [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=544.62s)]
*  and put them in such a position of weakness, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=547.58s)]
*  them and Iran, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=549.38s)]
*  that there was no support for Hamas moving forward. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=550.98s)]
*  Hamas knew it had to deal, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=553.38s)]
*  and that was a result, again, of work by the IDF [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=555.3s)]
*  with our support to make it harder for Hamas. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=558.86s)]
*  But clearly, and the president talked about this today, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=561.98s)]
*  we approached these negotiations as one team. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=564.74s)]
*  Once President-elect Trump won the election, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=566.98s)]
*  the president directed us, our team, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=569.7s)]
*  to reach out to them to make sure [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=572.3000000000001s)]
*  that they were fully informed [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=573.62s)]
*  and were coordinated with and involved. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=575.46s)]
*  And Mr. Witkoff was involved in discussions [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=578.0200000000001s)]
*  in the region, in Doha and in Tel Aviv, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=581.1s)]
*  because we know, the president knew, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=584.1400000000001s)]
*  that it was going to be up to Mr. Witkoff [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=586.5s)]
*  and the Trump team to implement this. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=587.9000000000001s)]
*  We just talked about how hard it's going to be to implement [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=589.34s)]
*  or how much work there's going to need to be done. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=591.5s)]
*  Need to make sure that they were fully informed [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=593.74s)]
*  so they could do that. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=595.1800000000001s)]
*  And the Qatari prime minister [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=596.34s)]
*  complimented that collaboration as influential. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=598.0600000000001s)]
*  You mentioned Hamas, because Biden did say today [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=602.94s)]
*  that the people of Gaza can look forward [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=605.3000000000001s)]
*  to a future without Hamas. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=607.22s)]
*  But what's your assessment of their current state [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=608.94s)]
*  within the Middle East right now? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=612.46s)]
*  They're much weaker, Hamas says, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=616.14s)]
*  than they've ever been before. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=617.58s)]
*  Again, Sinwar is dead. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=619.14s)]
*  The leader, the one who decided to launch [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=620.5s)]
*  those dastardly attacks on the 7th of October. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=622.22s)]
*  There are other leaders at all kinds of levels [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=625.66s)]
*  in their chains of command [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=628.0600000000001s)]
*  have been taken off the battlefield. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=628.94s)]
*  Infrastructure's been destroyed. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=630.22s)]
*  Tunnels absolutely flattened. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=631.46s)]
*  No ability to continue to recruit [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=633.98s)]
*  the kind of fighters that they want. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=636.38s)]
*  Militarily, they are a spent force. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=638.38s)]
*  They are dramatically weaker, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=640.62s)]
*  which is why we believe they were more willing to deal now. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=641.78s)]
*  Of course, they're also more isolated. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=645.46s)]
*  It's not just Hamas that's weaker. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=647.14s)]
*  Iran is weaker than it's ever been before. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=648.98s)]
*  Hezbollah wasn't going to come to the rescue of Hamas [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=651.58s)]
*  because the United States brokered a ceasefire [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=653.9s)]
*  between Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=656.5s)]
*  And Hamas, they could see the writing on the wall. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=657.9399999999999s)]
*  They could see they had really nowhere else to go. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=660.8199999999999s)]
*  All right, well, we will, of course, stay tuned [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=664.4599999999999s)]
*  as this becomes implemented and looking forward, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=666.54s)]
*  hopefully, to some good news this weekend [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=668.98s)]
*  for those families. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwj4rW-VbnQ&t=670.8199999999999s)]
