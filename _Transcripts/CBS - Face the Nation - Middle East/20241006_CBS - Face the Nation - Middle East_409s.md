# Ret. Gen. Frank McKenzie says  Iran is the country that's in a corner
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs)
*  To discuss the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, we go now to retired General Frank McKenzie, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=0.0s)]
*  who was the former commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=4.88s)]
*  It's good to have you back with us, General. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=8.08s)]
*  We saw... [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=11.92s)]
*  Good to be with you, Margaret. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=12.4s)]
*  We saw the U.S. and Israel say there would be severe consequences for what Iran did with those [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=13.84s)]
*  180 missiles fired at Israel. President Biden said he doesn't support an Israeli strike on [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=19.68s)]
*  Iran's nuclear facilities and he'd be thinking instead about alternative targets to oil fields. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=25.52s)]
*  What do you expect the U.S. to do and what do you expect to happen in the next few days? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=32.16s)]
*  Well, Margaret, let's begin by saying Iran is the country that's in a corner. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=42.4s)]
*  Their strike against Israel several nights ago was not particularly successful. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=46.64s)]
*  Their principal ally in the region, Hezbollah, has been decapitated and its own offensive capability [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=50.72s)]
*  is gravely limited. Hezbollah is as gravely limited. So Iran's on their back heel. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=56.4s)]
*  Israel has a lot of choices here. They can choose for something that would be very escalatory in [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=60.88s)]
*  terms of a strike against the Supreme Leader himself, perhaps, or against the nuclear program, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=65.04s)]
*  or against the oil infrastructure, or they could look at military intelligence targets. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=69.84s)]
*  They have a wide variety of options that they can choose from. They have the capability to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=74.48s)]
*  execute most of those attacks. I will say this. The nuclear target is a very difficult target. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=78.88s)]
*  It's large and complex. I held the plans for that when I was the Central Command Commander. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=84.08s)]
*  I'm very familiar with it. There are a lot of other alternatives to that target that perhaps [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=88.72s)]
*  you could go after first, then hold that in case you get into an escalatory ladder with the Iranians. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=92.8s)]
*  But the Israelis are certainly going to hit back and I predict it will be larger than the very [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  restrained, very modulated response that we saw in April after the first large Iranian attack [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=102.88s)]
*  on Israel. You heard the Republican Chair of the House Intelligence Committee [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=108.8s)]
*  not advocate for an attack on nuclear facilities but say it shouldn't be taken off the table. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  It's been widely reported for some time, General, that it's only the United States [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=121.52s)]
*  who could effectively take out the underground facilities that Iran has. Does that remain the case? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=126.24s)]
*  Well, let me begin by saying you should never take a potential target off the menu. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=132.24s)]
*  You want your adversary to have to plan to defend everything. So giving them assistance and not [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=137.12s)]
*  having to defend against a particular target is probably not the best way to establish this kind [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=143.12s)]
*  of deterrence. Having said that, the Iranian nuclear target is a very difficult target. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=148.24s)]
*  We have special capabilities that allow us to get at it. The Israelis do not have all of those [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=153.36s)]
*  capabilities. They can certainly hurt this target if they choose to strike it. But again, because of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=158.72s)]
*  its size, complexity and scope and how it's expanded over the last 10 years, it's a very [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=161.83999999999997s)]
*  difficult target to take out. It would be very resource intensive and I would argue just from a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=166.48s)]
*  purely military point of view, there are perhaps targets that are more productive to hit in an [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=171.27999999999997s)]
*  initial response. Do you want to give us some options? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=176.72s)]
*  Well again, we talked about some of them. I think oil infrastructure is certainly a possibility and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=180.08s)]
*  the oil infrastructure can be very broad. You can look at refineries, you can look at storage [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=184.56s)]
*  facilities, you can look at locations where the oil is unloaded onto ships. So within the oil [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=189.2s)]
*  target, it's not monolithic. You can be escalatory or less escalatory as you look at targets there. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=194.64s)]
*  That might be something to take a look at, but I'll tell you, it's not a very difficult target. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=200.72s)]
*  That might be something to take a look at, but I'll tell you, the other thing, Margaret, is the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=205.44s)]
*  Iranians made a big show of targeting the Maasai headquarters in urban Tel Aviv. Israel certainly [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=210.96s)]
*  has the capability to go after IRGC, Islamic Republican Guard Corps headquarters, and intelligence [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=216.88s)]
*  buildings all around Tehran or anywhere else. Again, as we know from April, Israel has the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=223.68s)]
*  ability to operate not with impunity, but with great force over Iran at a time and place of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=228.88s)]
*  their choosing. And I'm sure they're thinking about all those options right now. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=234.56s)]
*  Since you've characterized Iran as cornered here, are you at all concerned that this could be the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  kind of event that would trigger them to actually pursue a nuclear weapon? They've given themselves [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  options, but they've never fully pursued it in the way that U.S. intelligence has said the supreme [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=253.6s)]
*  leader would have to make the ultimate decision to do. Could this be the trigger event? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=259.44s)]
*  Margaret, it's always been my belief that the Iranians flirt with breakout, with getting enough [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=267.36s)]
*  fissile material to create a bomb in order to extract concessions from us. Because we dance, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  we're very eager to come to an agreement with them on the nuclear issue so they know they can [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=277.6s)]
*  get stuff from us. They also know if they cross that line, you can't go back. That's a Rubicon [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=281.36s)]
*  that can't be recrossed. But even if they do develop the fissile material, which they can do [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=286.08000000000004s)]
*  within a matter of days or weeks, they still have a delivery problem. They've got to create a missile [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  and an entry system that will allow it to take the missile to Tel Aviv or whatever target they [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  choose. That's a matter of many months. And that's the valley of death for Iran, because during that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=300.16s)]
*  period of time, they will have declared nuclear and they will be vulnerable. It's not a physics [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=305.36s)]
*  problem, it's an aeronautical engineering problem. And the aeronautical engineering systems in Iran [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=309.44s)]
*  are going to be vulnerable to attack. So it's not as easy as you might think for them to just declare [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=314.08s)]
*  we're going nuclear or to go nuclear. They've got to balance a number of things as they do that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=319.52s)]
*  Important context. If I can ask you, sir, former President Trump, as you know, faces an ongoing [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=323.76s)]
*  assassination threat as revenge for ordering the killing of Qassem Soleimani, that Iranian general. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=330.32s)]
*  You played a key role in that, and I know you face threats as well. Mr. Trump recently said, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=336.4s)]
*  big threats on my life by Iran. The entire U.S. military is watching and waiting. The Biden [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  White House has condemned the threats, but some Republicans say it's not loud enough. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=348.4s)]
*  How do you think this should be messaged? Do you think Iran is getting the message not to go [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=354.32s)]
*  through with this? So whenever we look at Iran, we need to look at what's their basic motivation. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=360.88s)]
*  The principal goal of Iranian statecraft is regime preservation. They view the election [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=368.24s)]
*  of President Trump as a direct threat to that regime preservation. So I have no doubt believing [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=373.28s)]
*  that Iran is very active in its attempts to go after the former president, as well as other [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=377.92s)]
*  officials, of which I am keenly personally interested as well. But I think that that's [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=382.24s)]
*  what's driving their behavior. It's desperation, Margaret. It's actually the same sort of desperation [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=386.72s)]
*  that drove the massive attack on Israel of three or four nights ago. They're in a corner, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=391.6s)]
*  and they really don't have any good options, but they don't want to sit still and do nothing. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=395.68s)]
*  They do view President Trump as worse than the alternative that could be elected. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  General, thank you for your analysis. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmfb7m0jAs&t=405.68s)]
