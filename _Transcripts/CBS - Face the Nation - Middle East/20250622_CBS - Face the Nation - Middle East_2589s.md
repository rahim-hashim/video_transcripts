# Inside the U.S. "Operation Midnight Hammer" mission in Iran
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0)
*  This is a CBS News special report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  I'm Maurice Dubois in New York. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  We're coming on the air now as the Pentagon is about to give us an update on last evening's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=12.1s)]
*  strikes against three key Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=17.0s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=19.88s)]
*  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs will demonstrate it was an incredible and overwhelming success. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=20.88s)]
*  The order we received from our Commander-in-Chief was focused, it was powerful, and it was clear. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=28.18s)]
*  We devastated the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=36.14s)]
*  But it's worth noting the operation did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=40.9s)]
*  For the entirety of his time in office, President Trump has consistently stated for over 10 [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=46.92s)]
*  that Iran must not get a nuclear weapon full stop. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=53.06s)]
*  Thanks to President Trump's bold and visionary leadership and his commitment to peace through [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=59.18s)]
*  strength, Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=63.78s)]
*  Many presidents have dreamed of delivering the final blow to Iran's nuclear program. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=69.82000000000001s)]
*  And none could until President Trump. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=76.7s)]
*  The operation President Trump planned was bold and it was brilliant, showing the world [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=82.10000000000001s)]
*  that American deterrence is back. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=88.62s)]
*  When this president speaks, the world should listen. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=92.62s)]
*  And the U.S. military? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=97.62s)]
*  We can back it up. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=99.9s)]
*  The most powerful military the world has ever known. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=101.78s)]
*  No other country on planet Earth could have conducted the operation that the chairman [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=105.86s)]
*  is going to outline this morning. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=110.38s)]
*  Not even close. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=112.66s)]
*  Just like Soleimani found out in the first term, Iran found out when POTUS says 60 days [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=116.22s)]
*  that he seeks peace and negotiation, he means 60 days of peace and negotiation. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=122.94s)]
*  Otherwise that nuclear program, that nuclear capability will not exist. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=129.54s)]
*  He meant it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=135.98s)]
*  This is not the previous administration. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=136.98s)]
*  The President Trump said no nukes. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=141.29999999999998s)]
*  He seeks peace and Iran should take that path. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=145.66s)]
*  He sent out a truth last night saying this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=151.78s)]
*  Any retaliation by Iran against the United States of America will be met with force far [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=156.5s)]
*  greater than what was witnessed tonight. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=162.98s)]
*  Signed the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=167.22s)]
*  Iran would be smart to heed those words. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=171.17999999999998s)]
*  He said it before and he means it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=175.45999999999998s)]
*  I want to give recognition to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Joint Staff, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=178.29999999999998s)]
*  General Eric Carilla at CENTCOM, who did a phenomenal job, he and his staff, all of CENTCOM. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=184.14s)]
*  Across the board, this was a joint effort and across the Pentagon effort. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=191.85999999999999s)]
*  I want to recognize the pilots who flew those bombers, who flew those fighters, who flew [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=198.14s)]
*  those refuelers, warriors. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=205.7s)]
*  I want to recognize the sailors on those destroyers, in those subs, on those carriers, warriors, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=208.89999999999998s)]
*  all of them. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=215.38s)]
*  I want to recognize our soldiers doing air defense, base defense, QRF, warriors, all [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=216.78s)]
*  of them. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=223.01999999999998s)]
*  Every American involved in this operation performed flawlessly. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=224.01999999999998s)]
*  And I want to give recognition to our allies in Israel as well. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=230.01999999999998s)]
*  This is a plan that took months and weeks of positioning and preparation so that we [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=235.42s)]
*  could be ready when the President of the United States called. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=240.45999999999998s)]
*  It took a great deal of precision, it involved misdirection, and the highest of operational [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=245.62s)]
*  security. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=253.70000000000002s)]
*  Our B-2s went in and out of downtown Tehran, not Tehran, excuse me, of these nuclear sites, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=255.62s)]
*  in and out and back without the world knowing at all. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=261.78000000000003s)]
*  In that way, it was historic. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=266.34000000000003s)]
*  A strike that included the longest B-2 Spirit bomber mission since 2001 and the first operational [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=268.46s)]
*  employment of the MOP, a massive ordnance penetrator. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=273.94s)]
*  The mission demonstrated to the world the level of joint and allied integration that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=278.74s)]
*  speak to the strength of our alliance and our joint forces. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=283.78000000000003s)]
*  As President Trump has stated, the United States does not seek war. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=287.90000000000003s)]
*  But let me be clear, we will act swiftly and decisively when our people, our partners, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=292.14s)]
*  or our interests are threatened. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=299.58000000000004s)]
*  Everyone should listen to the President of the United States and know that he means it, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=303.14000000000004s)]
*  every word. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=306.1s)]
*  I want to give congratulations to our Commander in Chief. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=307.1s)]
*  It was an honor to watch him lead last night and throughout, and to our great American [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=309.94s)]
*  warriors on this successful operation. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=314.78000000000003s)]
*  God bless our troops, God bless America, and we give glory to God for his providence and [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=318.82000000000005s)]
*  continue to ask for his protection. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=325.58000000000004s)]
*  I turn it over now to the Chairman for specifics. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=329.42s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Secretary. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=332.97999999999996s)]
*  Thanks for recognizing all of our folks out there doing our nation's work, and nice to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=333.97999999999996s)]
*  see everybody on this early Sunday morning. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=340.14s)]
*  Last night on the President's orders, U.S. Central Command, under the command of General [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=343.26s)]
*  Eric Carilla, executed Operation Midnight Hammer, a deliberate and precise strike against three [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=347.21999999999997s)]
*  Iranian nuclear facilities. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=354.06s)]
*  This was a complex and high-risk mission carried out with exceptional skill and discipline [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=356.67999999999995s)]
*  by our Joint Force. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=362.1s)]
*  I want to thank every service member, planner, operator that made this mission possible. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=363.66s)]
*  Their actions reflect the highest standards of the United States Armed Forces. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=369.5s)]
*  This operation was designed to severely degrade Iran's nuclear weapons infrastructure. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=374.46000000000004s)]
*  It was planned and executed across multiple domains and theaters with coordination that [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=379.92s)]
*  reflects our ability to project power globally with speed and precision at the time and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=386.06s)]
*  place of our nation's choosing. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=392.42s)]
*  This was a highly classified mission with very few people in Washington knowing the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=394.9s)]
*  timing or nature of this plan. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=399.5s)]
*  I'll refer you to the graphic on the side as I walk you through some of the operational [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=402.06s)]
*  details. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=407.06s)]
*  At midnight Friday into Saturday morning, a large B-2 strike package comprised of bombers [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=408.9s)]
*  launched from the continental United States. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=414.7s)]
*  As part of the plan to maintain tactical surprise, part of the package proceeded to the west [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=417.38s)]
*  and into the Pacific as a decoy, a deception effort known only to an extremely small number [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=422.9s)]
*  of planners and key leaders here in Washington and in Tampa. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=430.46s)]
*  The main strike package comprised of seven B-2 Spirit bombers, each with two crew members, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=434.98s)]
*  proceeded quietly to the east with minimal communications. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=441.1s)]
*  Throughout the 18-hour flight into the target area, the aircraft completed multiple in-flight [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=446.38s)]
*  refuelings. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=451.98s)]
*  Once over land, the B-2s linked up with escort and support aircraft in a complex, tightly-timed [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=454.02000000000004s)]
*  maneuver requiring exact synchronization across multiple platforms in a narrow piece of airspace, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=461.34000000000003s)]
*  all done with minimal communications. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=469.14s)]
*  This type of integration is exactly what our joint force does better than anyone else in [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=472.94s)]
*  the world. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=479.17999999999995s)]
*  At approximately 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time last night and just prior to the strike package [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=480.76s)]
*  entering Iran, a U.S. submarine in the Central Command Area of Responsibility launched more [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=487.05999999999995s)]
*  than two dozen Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles against key surface infrastructure [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=493.18s)]
*  targets at Esfahan. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=499.06s)]
*  As the Operation Midnight Hammer strike package entered Iranian airspace, the U.S. employed [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=501.47999999999996s)]
*  several deception tactics, including decoys, as the fourth and fifth generation aircraft [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=507.36s)]
*  pushed out in front of the strike package at high altitude and high speed, sweeping [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=514.78s)]
*  in front of the package for enemy fighters and surface-to-air missile threats. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=520.9s)]
*  The strike package was supported by U.S. Strategic Command, U.S. Transportation Command, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=526.66s)]
*  U.S. Cyber Command, U.S. Space Command, U.S. Space Force, and U.S. European Command. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=532.66s)]
*  As the strike package approached Fordow and Natanz, the U.S. Protection package employed [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=542.02s)]
*  high-speed suppression weapons to ensure safe passage of the strike package, with fighter [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=549.22s)]
*  assets employing preemptive suppressing fires against any potential Iranian surface-to-air [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=555.1s)]
*  threats. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=562.3s)]
*  We are currently unaware of any shots fired at the U.S. strike package on the way in. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=563.26s)]
*  At approximately 6.40 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, 2.10 a.m. Iran time, the lead B-2 missile [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=570.68s)]
*  dropped two GBU-57 massive ordnance penetrator weapons on the first of several aim points [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=579.42s)]
*  at Fordow. As the President stated last night, the remaining bombers then hit their targets [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=587.22s)]
*  as well, with a total of 14 MOPs dropped against two nuclear target areas. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=593.06s)]
*  All three Iranian nuclear infrastructure targets were struck between 6.40 p.m. and 7.05 p.m. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=600.9s)]
*  Eastern Time, with the Tomahawk missiles being the last to strike at Esfahan to ensure [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=609.02s)]
*  we retain the element of surprise throughout the operation. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=619.42s)]
*  Following weapons release, the Midnight Hammer Strike Package exited Iranian airspace and [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=624.98s)]
*  the package began its return home. We are unaware of any shots fired at the package [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=630.78s)]
*  on the way out. Iran's fighters did not fly, and it appears that Iran's surface-to-air [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=638.54s)]
*  missile systems did not see us. Throughout the mission, we retained the element of surprise. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=646.78s)]
*  In total, U.S. forces employed approximately 75 precision-guided weapons during this operation. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=655.5s)]
*  This included, as the President stated last night, 14 30,000-pound GBU-57 massive ordnance [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=661.98s)]
*  penetrators, marking the first-ever operational use of this weapon. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=669.66s)]
*  I know that battle damage is of great interest. Final battle damage will take some time, but [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=675.7s)]
*  initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=681.0600000000001s)]
*  damage and destruction. More than 125 U.S. aircraft participated in this mission, including [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=686.5s)]
*  B-2 stealth bombers, multiple flights of fourth and fifth generation fighters, dozens and [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=695.82s)]
*  dozens of air refueling tankers, a guided missile submarine, and a full array of intelligence, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=703.18s)]
*  surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as hundreds of maintenance and operational [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=710.66s)]
*  professionals. As the Secretary said, this was the largest [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=716.3s)]
*  B-2 operational strike in U.S. history and the second-longest B-2 mission ever flown, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=721.2199999999999s)]
*  exceeded only by those in the days following 9-11. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=729.9s)]
*  All prior to the strike, General Corilla elevated force protection measures across the region, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=734.98s)]
*  especially in Iraq, Syria, and the Gulf. Our forces remain on high alert and are fully [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=740.34s)]
*  postured to respond to any Iranian retaliation or proxy attacks, which would be an incredibly [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=747.74s)]
*  poor choice. We will defend ourselves. The safety of our service members and civilians [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=755.5s)]
*  remains our highest priority. This mission demonstrates the unmatched reach, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=763.5s)]
*  coordination, and capability of the United States military. In just a matter of weeks, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=770.5s)]
*  this went from strategic planning to global execution. This operation underscores the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=775.5s)]
*  unmatched capabilities and global reach of the United States military. As the President [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=782.5s)]
*  clearly said last night, no other military in the world could have done this. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=788.82s)]
*  I join the President and the Secretary in being incredibly proud of the air crews, naval [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=796.46s)]
*  forces, cyber operators, planners and support teams, and commanders who made this mission [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=802.26s)]
*  possible. It is their skill, discipline, and teamwork that makes this operation possible. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=807.58s)]
*  I am particularly proud of our discipline related to operational security, something [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=815.5s)]
*  that was of great concern to the President, the Secretary, General Corilla, and me, and [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=821.46s)]
*  we will continue to focus on this. As we stand here this morning, many assets [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=827.5s)]
*  are still airborne, and we have hundreds deployed. I ask that we keep our warfighters on their [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=833.38s)]
*  way home and our deployed service member in our thoughts. Our joint force remains ready [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=839.1s)]
*  to defend the United States, our troops, and our interests in the region. Thank you very [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=845.58s)]
*  much. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=850.9s)]
*  We will take a few questions. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=851.62s)]
*  So, is regime change off the table, Mr. Secretary? And to the Chairman, you said the battle damage [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=856.02s)]
*  assessment is still ongoing, but do you believe that some nuclear capability in Iran remains? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=863.86s)]
*  This mission was not and has not been about regime change. The President authorized a [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=871.62s)]
*  precision operation to neutralize the threats to our national interests posed by the Iranian [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=877.62s)]
*  nuclear program and the collective self-defense of our troops and our ally Israel. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=884.22s)]
*  Thanks for your question. I think BDA is still pending, and it would be way too early for [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=891.62s)]
*  me to comment on what may or may not still be there. But thanks for the question. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=897.38s)]
*  Green. Green. No, behind you. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=902.38s)]
*  Excuse me, Mr. Secretary. Can you tell me, was there a particular moment when the President [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=904.86s)]
*  decided to pull the trigger on this operation where he said, now, rather than being something [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=910.02s)]
*  in the holster, now we're going to pull the trigger on it? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=915.86s)]
*  I would just say, having the opportunity to witness his leadership, he was fully committed [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=918.18s)]
*  to the peace process, wanted a negotiated outcome, gave Iran every single opportunity, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=924.02s)]
*  and, unfortunately, was met by stonewalling, which is why he gave them plenty of time to [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=931.02s)]
*  continue to come to the table and give up enrichment, give up the nuclear program. But [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=935.64s)]
*  there was a, I won't say the particular moment, there was certainly a moment in time where [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=940.2199999999999s)]
*  he realized that it had to be a certain action taken in order to minimize the threat to [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=943.38s)]
*  us and our troops. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=949.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=951.02s)]
*  General, you say that General Corolla increased force protection in Iraq, Syria, and Gulf [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=952.02s)]
*  in those areas. Were they given any advance warning, the attacks were coming? And also, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=958.06s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, when were congressional leaders notified, how long before the attacks took [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=964.34s)]
*  place? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=970.02s)]
*  Sir, to your first question, you know, the risk has clearly been rising over the last [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=971.66s)]
*  few weeks in the region. Based on that, and not a particular awareness of this operation, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=976.22s)]
*  we've made smart decisions to minimize the risk to U.S. forces in the region. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=983.3s)]
*  So they were given no advance warning? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=987.78s)]
*  No, sir. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=989.78s)]
*  And congressional? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=990.78s)]
*  They were notified after the planes were safely out, when we complied with the notification [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=992.78s)]
*  requirements of the War Powers Act. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=999.42s)]
*  After the attacks, they were notified? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1001.02s)]
*  They were immediately thereafter. Yes. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1002.38s)]
*  Thank you, Secretary. Two quick questions. Do you believe you completely destroyed Iranian [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1005.38s)]
*  nuclear program? And how about Iranian ballistic missiles? Your ally, Israel, always saying [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1013.54s)]
*  that is biggest threat. And second question is very important. What will be your next [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1021.62s)]
*  step if Iran or militias under Iranian influence in the region attack U.S. interests or allies [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1029.26s)]
*  in the region? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1039.14s)]
*  And you can chime in on this too, Mr. Chairman. The battle damage assessment is ongoing, but [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1040.14s)]
*  our initial assessment, as the Chairman said, is that all of our precision munitions struck [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1046.3s)]
*  where we wanted them to strike and had the desired effect, which means especially in [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1051.02s)]
*  which was the primary target here. We believe we achieved destruction of capabilities there. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1056.42s)]
*  Ultimately, wherever it may be, whether it's in Iraq or Syria or bases in the Gulf, as [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1062.38s)]
*  the President said it would be, or excuse me, as the Chairman said it would be a very [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1069.18s)]
*  bad idea for Iran or its proxies to attempt to attack American forces. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1072.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1077.82s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Regarding retaliations, Iran and North Korea are cooperating on nuclear [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1078.82s)]
*  and missile development. Do you think there is a possibility that Iran, North Korea, and [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1088.54s)]
*  other forces such as China will join forces to retaliate against United States? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1096.4199999999998s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, because of the policies under the previous administration, we drove [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1107.62s)]
*  those countries together, and ultimately that creates a challenging environment. For this [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1110.86s)]
*  particular operation, the focus is on Iran and Iranian nuclear capabilities. That's our [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1118.8999999999999s)]
*  focus here is to not just say that they can't have, but President Trump has said from over [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1123.02s)]
*  20 years, frankly, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. And ultimately, he decided this is [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1128.6999999999998s)]
*  their first time to do that. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1135.1s)]
*  And I think that's a very good point. I think that's a very good point. I think that's a [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1136.1s)]
*  very good point. I think that's a very good point. I think that's a very good point. I [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1137.1s)]
*  think that's a very good point. I think that's a very good point. I think that's a very [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1138.1s)]
*  good point. I think that's a very good point. I think that's a very good point. I think [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1139.1s)]
*  that's a very good point. I think that's a very good point. I think that's a very good [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1140.1s)]
*  point. I think that's a very good point. I think that's a very good point. I think that's [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1141.1s)]
*  a very good point. I think that's a very good point. I think that's a very good point. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1142.1s)]
*  I think that's a very good point. I think that's a very good point. I think that's a very [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1143.1s)]
*  I understand OBSEC. I respect OBSEC. Can you say at all what security procedures are being [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1144.6399999999999s)]
*  taken to protect U.S. troops in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East? And Secretary Hegseth, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1150.9399999999998s)]
*  as a global war on terrorism veteran, what do you say to veterans who may be concerned [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1156.82s)]
*  the U.S. is getting into another open-ended war in the Middle East over weapons of mass [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1161.78s)]
*  destruction? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1165.74s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth, U.S. Secretary of State for Human Rights and Human Rights [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1166.74s)]
*  Thanks, sir, for the question. I won't comment on what force protection measures are being [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1167.74s)]
*  taken in the region. What I will say is we're being proactive and not reactive and being [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1173.54s)]
*  very thoughtful about ensuring that we do all that we can to protect our forces out [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1181.1000000000001s)]
*  there. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1185.3s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth, U.S. Secretary of State for Human Rights and Human Rights [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1186.3s)]
*  And I would just say, as the President has directed and made clear, this is most certainly [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1187.3s)]
*  not open-ended. It doesn't mean it limits our ability to respond. We will respond if [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1190.98s)]
*  necessary. The most powerful military in the world is postured and prepared to defend our [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1197.3s)]
*  people. But what the President gave us, as I said, was a focused, powerful, and clear [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1201.34s)]
*  mission on the destruction of Iranian nuclear capabilities. Those were the targets. That's [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1207.02s)]
*  what was struck. That was overwhelming. That's what was overwhelming. That's what the Iranian [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1212.94s)]
*  regime needs to understand, as the President put out last night. He wants peace. There [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1217.4199999999998s)]
*  needs to be a negotiated settlement here. We ultimately demonstrated that Iran cannot [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1222.3799999999999s)]
*  have a nuclear capability. That is a very clear mission set on this operation. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1227.64s)]
*  Yes, hold on. Yes, right there. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1232.64s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Secretary. A question for the Secretary and the Chairman. How is this strike [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1235.64s)]
*  coordinated with the Israelis on a strategic level militarily and on a tactical level? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1244.52s)]
*  Was there any direct Israeli military participation in this operation? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1252.08s)]
*  I would say certainly Israel had an incredible military success, especially at the beginning [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1259.4s)]
*  and ongoing, in degrading Iranian capabilities, degrading Iranian launchers, MRVMs. It's been [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1267.2s)]
*  incredible to watch what our ally Israel has been able to do. There certainly have been [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1274.76s)]
*  conversations. General Karila at CENTCOM has worked closely in the defense of Israel [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1279.8s)]
*  for many years. Part of this operation was the defense of Israel and the ongoing defense [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1284.68s)]
*  of Israel. As it pertains to this strike, this was U.S.-operated and U.S.-led. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1291.1599999999999s)]
*  We took advantage of some of the preparatory work that's been done over the past week and [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1296.9199999999998s)]
*  a half in terms of axis of approach. I won't get into the particulars, but as the Secretary [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1301.6s)]
*  said, it was a U.S. strike. We made sure we were not in the same piece of airspace and [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1307.32s)]
*  sky. Aside from that, that was the extent of it. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1313.6399999999999s)]
*  We'll take a couple more. Yeah, right there. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1316.9199999999998s)]
*  A question for the Secretary first. Are you concerned whatsoever now about the reaction [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1320.12s)]
*  from U.S. allies given the strike, particularly those in the Gulf? And to the Chairman, if [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1324.32s)]
*  I may, I understand you don't want to speak to specific assets and force protection measures, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1329.32s)]
*  but do you anticipate at least having to bring in any further assets from other theaters [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1334.08s)]
*  to aid in force protection over the coming days? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1338.3999999999999s)]
*  We certainly understand the challenges of allies in the region, and we have been respectful [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1343.08s)]
*  and working in collaboration with them as it pertains to basing and sensitivities there. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1347.6999999999998s)]
*  Ultimately, they've got a lot of assets and people in those locations also where American [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1353.9199999999998s)]
*  troops are co-located. So that's a consideration of ours. We've been in close consultation [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1358.6599999999999s)]
*  with them, and we appreciate the support that we have got. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1363.12s)]
*  Thanks for the question on sort of the global picture. And as you know, that's one of my [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1366.2s)]
*  jobs is to look globally at the entire range of challenges. We are always carefully considering [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1370.04s)]
*  our forced posture around the world and then offering options to the Secretary and to the [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1377.96s)]
*  President. I won't comment on any future things, but the American people should know that we [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1384.32s)]
*  carefully consider those moves around the world and try to modulate as needed our force [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1390.28s)]
*  structure in the region. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1397.8799999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah, right here. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1399.8799999999999s)]
*  Thank you. What communications are being sent to the Iranians right now, and is there any [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1401.8799999999999s)]
*  possibility of diplomacy now or in the coming days? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1406.08s)]
*  I can only confirm that there are both public and private messages being directly delivered [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1410.68s)]
*  to the Iranians in multiple channels, giving them every opportunity to come to the table. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1415.84s)]
*  They understand precisely what the American position is, precisely what steps they can [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1421.36s)]
*  take to allow for peace, and we hope they do so. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1427.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1432.12s)]
*  The President may not want an open-ended conflict. The Iranians may disagree. Are you prepared [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1433.56s)]
*  for a protracted war? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1439.36s)]
*  Well, anything can happen in conflict. We acknowledge that. But the scope of this was [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1442.6799999999998s)]
*  intentionally limited. That's the message that we're sending. With the capabilities [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1446.1599999999999s)]
*  of the American military nearly unlimited. So Iran, in that sense, has a choice. But [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1450.76s)]
*  we've made it very clear to them this is nuclear sites, this is nuclear capabilities, this [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1456.9199999999998s)]
*  is the line that the President set, and we set that back. Now is the time to come forward [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1461.6s)]
*  for peace, but we, I think one of the takeaways from this as well is the unprecedented level [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1467.8s)]
*  of ongoing cooperation. I can't speak highly enough of the Chairman and his staff and General [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1472.76s)]
*  Corilla in CENTCOM, what they've done to look around the corner, to pre-position, to understand [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1478.6000000000001s)]
*  how an operation like this comes together. The scope and scale of what occurred last [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1484.56s)]
*  night would take the breath away of almost any American if you had an opportunity to [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1489.68s)]
*  watch it in real time. And I think Tehran is certainly calculating the reality that [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1493.76s)]
*  planes flew from the middle of America and Missouri overnight, completely undetected [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1500.24s)]
*  over three of their most highly sensitive sites, and we were able to destroy nuclear [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1504.76s)]
*  capabilities and our boys in those bombers are on their way home right now. We believe [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1509.64s)]
*  that'll have a clear psychological impact on how they view the future, and we certainly [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1515.24s)]
*  hope they take the path of negotiated peace. But I could not be more proud of how this [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1519.98s)]
*  building operated, of the precision, the sensitivity and the professionalism of the troops involved [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1525.26s)]
*  in this effort. I will take one more, we'll take one more question. Yes, right there. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1531.3s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Concerning the justification for these strikes, in March the Office of [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1536.5s)]
*  the Director of National Intelligence released their threat assessment concluding, quote, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1544.5s)]
*  Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Khomeini has not authorized the nuclear programs [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1550.5s)]
*  he suspended in 2003, unquote. So what new intelligence does the U.S. have since then [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1557.54s)]
*  that the Iranians have changed their position on nuclear weapons, and does this new intelligence [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1565.1s)]
*  come from U.S. sources and methods, or are we getting this information from other countries? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1570.54s)]
*  Well, I would just simply say that the President's made it very clear. He's looked at all of [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1576.22s)]
*  this, all of the intelligence, all of the information, and come to the conclusion that [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1580.74s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear program is a threat, and was willing to take this precision operation [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1585.1s)]
*  to neutralize that threat in order to advance American national interests, reduce the Iranian [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1591.94s)]
*  nuclear program, and obviously collective self-defense of ourselves and our allies. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1596.88s)]
*  So he looked at all of it, understood the nature of the threat, and took bold action [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1600.4s)]
*  I think the American people would expect in a Commander-in-Chief. That's all we've got. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1604.3200000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Mr. Chairman. We have been listening as top officials there [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1608.8000000000002s)]
*  at the Pentagon describing what they're calling Operation Midnight Hammer, the U.S. airstrikes [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1614.6000000000001s)]
*  on Iran. They say it took all of 25 minutes for U.S. B-2 bombers to drop 14 bunker buster [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1620.08s)]
*  bombs on Iranian nuclear targets. They say they hit them, they went in undetected, no [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1627.24s)]
*  one in the world had any idea the United States was doing this. They were in and out of Iran [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1632.8799999999999s)]
*  without anybody knowing. Secretary Hegsetz saying that Iran nuclear ambitions have been [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1637.56s)]
*  obliterated. Those were his words early on, and then later he said the assessment is still [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1642.32s)]
*  ongoing. It is also worth noting that the whole operation took 25 minutes last night, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1647.8s)]
*  640 to 705 Eastern Time. That news conference right there went on for 26 minutes. With us [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1653.16s)]
*  now is retired U.S. Marine Corps General Kenneth McKenzie, former head of U.S. Central Command, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1660.48s)]
*  current CBS News contributor. General, good morning to you. Americans, waking up to this [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1666.0s)]
*  news, this information, what did you make of what you just saw? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1670.2s)]
*  Well, first of all, it was a remarkable execution by the joint force. The chairman and the secretary [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1673.6399999999999s)]
*  both described it very clearly. Remarkable capabilities that we have. We employed them [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1678.6799999999998s)]
*  last night. The other point I think that both the secretary and the chairman emphasized [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1683.04s)]
*  is the tightly focused nature of the operation, going strictly after the nuclear program. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1687.34s)]
*  I think what we're trying to do with this strike is give the Iranians some room to maneuver. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1692.56s)]
*  Whether or not they'll be smart enough to take that remains to be seen. I'm sure that [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1697.96s)]
*  right now Central Command is prepared for anything that could happen as a result of [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1702.44s)]
*  this strike. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1706.24s)]
*  The idea that we went in there undetected, General, that was very striking. How much [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1707.1200000000001s)]
*  weaker in your view, from where you said, I know you're not at CENTCOM any longer, but [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1711.52s)]
*  how much weaker does it appear Iran actually is? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1716.3200000000002s)]
*  Well Maurice, this is a plan that's been refined over the last 15 years. We've continually [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1719.48s)]
*  updated it and General Corrella has obviously done some magnificent work in planning an [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1725.98s)]
*  execution. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1731.44s)]
*  Iran is weakened. Iran is probably the weakest they've been since I began studying the problem. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1732.2s)]
*  Their air defenses are essentially gutted. They have very limited surveillance capability. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1737.2s)]
*  By surveillance I mean the ability to see airplanes flying in their territory. The plan [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1742.28s)]
*  would have been able to, I think, achieve success had Iran been at 100 percent, but [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1746.8400000000001s)]
*  it's always better to face an intruded enemy. This is a very significant and dangerous time [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1751.64s)]
*  for Iran. The highest goal of Iranian statecraft is to preserve the regime. The regime is now [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1757.24s)]
*  threatened and they have proven demonstrably unable to defend their country. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1762.78s)]
*  Okay General, thank you so much. Let's go to CBS's Holly Williams who is in Iraq near [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1767.2s)]
*  the Iran border, near the city of Erbil, I believe it is Holly. What are you getting [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1772.4s)]
*  in terms of reaction from Iranians outside their country? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1777.2s)]
*  Good morning Maurice. Well, Iran's foreign minister said this morning that the U.S. had [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1783.56s)]
*  committed a grave violation of international law and that Iran has to respond. Now that [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1786.76s)]
*  suggests that the Iranians feel, the Iranian regime feels compelled to retaliate against [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1792.2s)]
*  the U.S. perhaps because to do otherwise would be seen as a humiliation. But even before [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1797.16s)]
*  these U.S. airstrikes Iran had already accused the U.S. of being complicit in Israel's attacks [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1801.84s)]
*  and had threatened to retaliate against U.S. military bases. Now U.S. bases are scattered [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1807.24s)]
*  across the Middle East. They're clearly potential targets for retaliation. Perhaps the most [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1813.02s)]
*  obvious targets are the U.S. bases here in Iraq simply because they are right next door. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1817.66s)]
*  There are also around 40,000 American troops here in the Middle East and they are now on [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1822.9s)]
*  high alert according to that briefing that you just heard. Now back in 2020 the Iranians [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1827.18s)]
*  attacked a U.S. base here in Iraq, Al-Assad, with ballistic missiles. We were there in [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1832.74s)]
*  the days following and saw the extensive damage though new U.S. service members were killed. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1839.58s)]
*  I guess the question now is, now that Iran has been weakened by more than nine days of [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1842.98s)]
*  war with Israel, what exactly kind of retaliation is it capable of? We don't know for sure, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1848.3s)]
*  but we may find out. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1856.5s)]
*  Okay, Holly Williams in Erbil this morning in Iraq. Thank you for the insight. Let's [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1857.86s)]
*  go to senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang. Weijia, any more details about who was [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1863.06s)]
*  in the situation room, how the president came to this decision and when he decided to pull [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1867.74s)]
*  the trigger? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1871.86s)]
*  Well, Maurice, what is very telling is the new information we received during that briefing [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1872.82s)]
*  about the exact time of the first strike, which was 6.40 p.m. Eastern time. We know [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1878.26s)]
*  that President Trump did not arrive back here to Washington, to the White House, until 6.03 [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1884.46s)]
*  p.m. He walked in one minute later and then went to the situation room to watch these [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1891.46s)]
*  strikes being carried out less than 40 minutes later. And he was surrounded by his national [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1896.8799999999999s)]
*  security team, the vice president, his chief of staff, Suzy Wiles, Defense Secretary Pete [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1902.3999999999999s)]
*  Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and several other officials, including intelligence [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1908.24s)]
*  officials, as they watched the teams here carry out the strike. But the other question [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1914.6399999999999s)]
*  that you asked, Maurice, is so critical, which is when the president exactly made this decision. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1922.64s)]
*  Because, as you remember, he was saying that Iran had this self-imposed, that he imposed [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1928.64s)]
*  two-week deadline to finally come to the negotiating table. And we had sources saying that he really [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1934.64s)]
*  did want to find some kind of diplomatic off-ramp. But as we just heard from Secretary Hegseth, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1940.4s)]
*  there was a moment when he realized that was not going to happen. And what we don't know [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1946.6s)]
*  is whether that moment was when he publicly signaled to the world that Iran had two weeks [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1951.6399999999999s)]
*  left or if it was before that. Because, obviously, as we heard, this was a mission that took [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1958.08s)]
*  a lot of advanced planning, and TikTok was critical in order for that precision to happen. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1964.0s)]
*  And so we will be putting together that timeline to better understand exactly how the president [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1971.96s)]
*  came to this decision. Today, he does not have any public events on his schedule, but [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1977.88s)]
*  his last message that he broadcast via social media was a warning to Iran that any retaliation [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1983.12s)]
*  would be met with more force from America. Maurice? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1990.84s)]
*  Yeah, the Defense Department officials, they're also saying, you know, it's up to Iran now, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1993.96s)]
*  to next move, whether they actually want peace. What changed? You have to wonder, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=1998.12s)]
*  Ouija, in these past few days. I know that's what you're saying there. We just don't know [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2003.4799999999998s)]
*  at this point, right? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2007.0s)]
*  Well, Maurice, there's a possibility that nothing had changed and that he had already [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2008.28s)]
*  decided that he was going to carry out this mission because our colleague, Jennifer Jacobs, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2012.7199999999998s)]
*  reported that he wanted to be in a position of strength as he heads to the NATO summit [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2018.6s)]
*  in just a couple days. He is scheduled to leave on Tuesday here. Remember, he rushed [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2025.6s)]
*  back from the G7 summit in order to monitor the escalating situation in Iran. And the [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2030.56s)]
*  reason why this matters is because in both instances, he is on the world stage, and he [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2037.48s)]
*  has made very clear that he believes the U.S. has to show strength, and that is how you [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2043.3999999999999s)]
*  achieve peace. And so we know that he wanted to have some sort of definitive deliverable [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2051.24s)]
*  to bring ahead of the NATO summit, and that is the end to Iran's nuclear program in one [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2057.72s)]
*  way or another, Maurice. So this is the path that he chose. He will be meeting with those [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2064.72s)]
*  world leaders in just a couple days. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2070.56s)]
*  Okay, Ouija Jang at the White House, thank you so much. Let's go to Charlie Dagata at [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2073.12s)]
*  the Pentagon. Charlie, you were at the news conference here. You asked a key question. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2077.6s)]
*  Is the administration ready for a long and protracted war? I don't know if you got the [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2081.7999999999997s)]
*  answer that would be definitive, but they said it's a bad idea for Iran to retaliate. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2086.88s)]
*  What did you make of what you heard, Charlie? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2092.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, you know, the question, that is the question, isn't it? Because the Iranians have [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2094.64s)]
*  never not retaliated. When Soleimani was assassinated under the Trump administration, they fired [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2098.24s)]
*  several cruise missiles into the most exposed and vulnerable U.S. base in that region, Al [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2106.16s)]
*  Asad, which is in Iraq. We were told today by the defense secretary and Joint Chiefs [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2112.16s)]
*  of Staff that they have taken specific measures in places like Iraq and Syria and in the Gulf, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2117.64s)]
*  where the American forces are well within reach not only of Iranian missiles, but Iranian-backed [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2125.16s)]
*  proxies, in fact, surrounded by them in the case of Iraq and Syria. So there wasn't [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2131.48s)]
*  a sort of definitive answer, and we didn't want to really get into operational security [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2136.4s)]
*  that would show the vulnerabilities of our U.S. forces there. But it is worth noting [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2142.6800000000003s)]
*  that none of them, it was pointed out in that press conference, nobody in that region was [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2147.1600000000003s)]
*  given notice of the operation until it was over. There had already been enhanced security [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2152.2200000000003s)]
*  measures in place. As we've reported, you and I have spoken about it before, about the [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2157.48s)]
*  beefing up of U.S. military presence in that region. There's a carrier strike group there. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2163.48s)]
*  There are a dozen destroyers. You heard in that press conference a submarine. We never [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2169.36s)]
*  know how many submarines are in the region, but a submarine took part in that attack against [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2174.32s)]
*  Iran. So, you know, the U.S. military is beefed up, and there are several bases within reach. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2180.16s)]
*  You've got the Fifth Fleet in Bahrain, Kuwait. Those will already have robust security measures [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2185.7599999999998s)]
*  because they are huge bases, including the UAE. But in areas where the U.S. forces are [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2192.3999999999996s)]
*  more exposed, the 2,500 or so in Iraq, where Hali is just reporting from, in northern Iraq, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2199.2799999999997s)]
*  there are a number of forces there, parts of Syria. This is where U.S. forces are well within [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2205.12s)]
*  reach and don't have the kind of anti-air support that you would have at these larger bases. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2211.84s)]
*  Charlie, to say that this is limited at its bad idea for Iran to retaliate, that they went in there [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2220.2400000000002s)]
*  and they got what they wanted, nuclear ambitions have been obliterated, but we still assess that. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2228.7200000000003s)]
*  That's what Pete Hegcess said in two different parts of the news conference. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2235.1200000000003s)]
*  How degraded can we tell at this point is Iran's capabilities? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2239.12s)]
*  Do you know, that's a key question. When we talk about the nuclear capabilities or nuclear programs [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2245.7599999999998s)]
*  being obliterated, extremely severe damage, these are some of the words that were used, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2253.04s)]
*  we know that the Israelis, not just in the current bombing campaign that started just over a week ago [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2259.12s)]
*  in degrading Iran's fight back in air defenses, which I think was clear, by the way, when we were [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2264.8s)]
*  told that U.S. forces went in there and not a shot was fired, according to Joint Chiefs of Staff, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2273.04s)]
*  either going in or going out, which may say something about Iran's defenses as far as their [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2279.84s)]
*  ability. Estimates had their ballistic missiles, excuse me, ballistic missiles at around 3,000. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2285.92s)]
*  We estimate maybe 1,000 of them have been fired so far against Israel, and the United States has [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2293.6s)]
*  defended Israel in that regard, as far as how much they've got left and the capability of firing them [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2299.76s)]
*  because a number of platforms have been taken out. That is unknown, or at least it's not something [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2306.08s)]
*  that's being shared here, but to say that they're completely obliterated, which was referring to [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2310.7200000000003s)]
*  their nuclear program, doesn't necessarily mean that their ballistic missile program is obliterated. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2316.16s)]
*  That is correct. Okay, Charlie Daggett at the Pentagon, thank you so much. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2321.2s)]
*  Joining us now is CBS News National Security contributor Samantha Vinograd. Sam, good morning [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2324.8799999999997s)]
*  to you. CBS News reporting, FBI has increased efforts to monitor possible domestic sleeper cells. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2329.2s)]
*  We have seen New York City hardening its religious and other areas around its city. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2335.12s)]
*  What else do you know about security steps being taken on the homeland? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2341.68s)]
*  The U.S. government was already on heightened alert for threats from Iranian-backed individuals, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2345.52s)]
*  whether individuals directed by Iran to strike U.S. assets or individuals inspired by Iran to do so. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2350.56s)]
*  In the aftermath of last night's strikes, I can tell you, Maurice, that police jurisdictions across [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2356.16s)]
*  the country are on heightened alert. They are increasing their operational footprint in front [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2362.56s)]
*  of religious sites, cultural sites, Israeli diplomatic sites and more, and all of the [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2367.4399999999996s)]
*  American should exercise caution in this environment. At the same time, the FBI and [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2373.04s)]
*  other members of the intelligence community will be doubling down on intelligence collection and [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2378.24s)]
*  analysis to try to monitor for any Iranian threats here in the homeland. So there is an [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2383.7599999999998s)]
*  intelligence component right now as well as an operational component underway. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2388.72s)]
*  Best you can tell, what's the general consensus on the likelihood of that happening? Do you have [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2393.36s)]
*  any feel for that, or is that just really an unknown at this point? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2398.96s)]
*  Well, we know that Iran has a decades-long history of exercising its proxies all around the world, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2402.2400000000002s)]
*  in Asia, in South America, in the United States and in Europe. At the same time, we also know that, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2410.2400000000002s)]
*  particularly post-October 7th, individuals, again, both directed and inspired by Iran, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2417.04s)]
*  and inspired by Iran, did seek to take action here in the homeland. So I don't want to [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2422.72s)]
*  guess on a hypothetical probability here, but again, I would advise all Americans to exercise [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2429.12s)]
*  caution here in the homeland and when traveling abroad. All Americans traveling abroad should [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2435.52s)]
*  register with the U.S. Embassy for their travel and receive alerts if the security situation [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2440.64s)]
*  does deteriorate. At the same time, Maurice, we also have to be aware that Iran has advanced [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2446.08s)]
*  cyber capabilities, and it's possible that Iran chooses to activate both a physical response [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2451.04s)]
*  and a cyber response. And federal, state and local authorities, after speaking to my sources, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2457.92s)]
*  I can tell you, are on heightened alert for both of those possibilities. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2463.36s)]
*  Okay, Samantha Vinograd, Sam, thank you so much. I want to bring back General McKenzie here. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2467.2s)]
*  General, you were the former head of CENTCOM. What would the next steps be here? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2472.08s)]
*  I think right now CENTCOM is focused on ensuring that our forces in the region are ready for any [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2476.8s)]
*  potential Iranian response. We're also prepared to defend our embassies and our U.S. citizens. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2483.04s)]
*  That process goes on all the time regardless, but we're at a very heightened state now, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2488.88s)]
*  and I'm sure they're taking every precaution they can to ensure that we'll be able to defend [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2493.2000000000003s)]
*  against whatever the Iranians choose to do. The other half of that equation is the Iranians need [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2497.52s)]
*  to be very clear to them, and I think we've made it clear to them that if they choose to attack us, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2502.4s)]
*  our response will be overwhelming, and we have that capability as well. So CENTCOM will work in [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2506.8s)]
*  those two lines of effort, I'm very sure, this morning. What's the mindset of military leaders [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2511.04s)]
*  at this point? Could you take us inside the room? Sure. I can speak directly to after the strike on [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2515.52s)]
*  Qasem Soleimani. So you've completed an operation. Your business is now to look to the next problem. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2522.5600000000004s)]
*  The next problem is going to be the Iranian response. So it was a great operation last night, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2528.2400000000002s)]
*  like a football play in the NFL. It's over. They're going to run another play in about 15 [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2533.2s)]
*  seconds. You need to be ready for it. So that's what you're thinking right now. That is the truth. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2536.56s)]
*  Okay, General McKenzie, thank you so much for the insight into all our correspondents as well. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2541.6s)]
*  Our coverage will continue on CBS News 24-7, and your local news for many of you. CBS News [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2545.7599999999998s)]
*  Sunday morning is coming up shortly, and later on Face the Nation, Margaret Brennan will speak [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2551.2799999999997s)]
*  with Secretary of State Marco Rubio as well as Senator Tim Kaine. This has been a special report [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2555.68s)]
*  here for CBS News. I'm Maurice Dubois in New York. Have a good day. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCRQZiyvBq0&t=2561.84s)]
