# Former CENTCOM chief on U.S. strikes on Iran and what comes next
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q)
*  We go now to the former commander of CENTCOM, which controls U.S. forces in the Middle East, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=0.0s)]
*  our CBS News contributor, retired general Frank McKenzie. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=4.88s)]
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation, General, and your former colleagues at CENTCOM, extremely [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=9.68s)]
*  busy over these last few hours. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  From the operation, as you've heard it described, what are the questions that come to your mind [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=18.52s)]
*  about Midnight Hammer and being able to assess its success? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=23.92s)]
*  So it looks like it was a successful operation from what we know now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=29.52s)]
*  It'll take a little while to build the battle damage assessment, and that'll come out here [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=32.72s)]
*  in the days ahead, and we'll get a much better picture. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=37.04s)]
*  But I think we've done significant damage, significant, perhaps irreversible damage to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=39.48s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  I think right now, though at CENTCOM, everybody is focused on the next step. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=46.76s)]
*  And the next step will be, will there be an Iranian response? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  What will that response look like? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=53.68s)]
*  What can we do to defend our forces, our embassies, our citizens in the region? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=55.42s)]
*  And what options can we give the president should we choose to respond as a result of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=59.82s)]
*  an Iranian attack? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=64.34s)]
*  So they're extremely busy down there right now. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=65.34s)]
*  But one of the key things they want to do is you want to make it very clear to Iran [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=67.98s)]
*  that we possess significant combat power in the theater and we'll be able to use it against [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=71.94s)]
*  them should they attack us. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=77.14s)]
*  Well, that's the hope that they don't do something. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=79.18s)]
*  Are you surprised that there has been no retaliation in the past few hours? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=83.02s)]
*  And where would you be looking as an area of concern? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=86.66s)]
*  There are a lot of Americans who have family members in the region. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=89.69999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely, Margaret. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=92.66s)]
*  So for one thing, I think the Iranian decision-making is a little crippled right now because of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=94.61999999999999s)]
*  the loss of senior leaders. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=99.34s)]
*  And as you're well aware, the Iranians don't have good succession planning. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=101.32s)]
*  People tend to go into jobs and stay there for a long period of time while they enrich [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=105.1s)]
*  themselves and their families. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  So cronyism is how you get to the top in their system, which is bad news if suddenly that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=110.6s)]
*  person is no longer there. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=115.52s)]
*  There's no one ready to step in. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  So the Supreme Leader probably has trouble talking to people and getting his orders followed. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=118.16s)]
*  Now to your question about where they might strike, I think we're certainly vulnerable [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=123.0s)]
*  in Iraq. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=126.42s)]
*  I think we're certainly vulnerable in Syria. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=127.42s)]
*  And I'm certain that Central Command has done all the things we need to do to harden ourselves [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=129.16s)]
*  against those potential attacks. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=133.34s)]
*  The same for our other bases across the region. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=134.98s)]
*  I don't know that it would be localized to the region, though. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=137.60000000000002s)]
*  Iran has long harbored the desire to attack us in the United States. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=141.24s)]
*  They typically have not been effective when they've done that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=144.94s)]
*  We've caught them in a couple of plots that are very public that you're well aware of. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=148.12s)]
*  So I think all those things are on the table. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=151.54000000000002s)]
*  But it may take the Iranians a little while to work through this process because nobody's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  excited about going to a meeting in Iran right now. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, you're talking about some of the intelligence actions taken by the Mossad to convene some [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=162.08s)]
*  of these leaders and then kill them all at once. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  When it comes to what the Secretary of State said earlier in this program, I asked him [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=172.72s)]
*  specifically if the U.S. would take military action to reopen the Strait of Hormuz if Iran [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=177.10000000000002s)]
*  tried to close it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  We know that's being talked about, at least in the public space in Iran right now. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  What would that operation look like? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=188.44s)]
*  Rubio said they're not exactly talking about it in this moment, but they are worried about [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=190.44s)]
*  the Iranians mining it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  The Iranians do have the capability to mine the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=198.52s)]
*  We have very good plans to clear that if we had to do it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=201.6s)]
*  We work on those plans all the time. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=204.98000000000002s)]
*  It would be a blow to world commerce for a period of time, but at the end, the strait [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=206.66s)]
*  would be cleared. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=211.94s)]
*  And I'm pretty confident the Iranian Navy would all be sunk at the end of that operation. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=212.94s)]
*  So the former CIA Director, Bob Gates, former Secretary of Defense, was on this program [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=217.9s)]
*  very recently, and I asked him about bombing the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=222.5s)]
*  He said when he had looked at it, he thought it would at best delay Iran's nuclear ambitions, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=227.10000000000002s)]
*  not end them. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=233.70000000000002s)]
*  You have looked at this problem set in great detail. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=235.14000000000001s)]
*  Do you agree that military force is not enough to end the program? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=238.58s)]
*  Ultimately, you need a policy decision from Iran to end the nuclear program. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=243.86s)]
*  So I think the Secretary is right in that position. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=249.02s)]
*  Now, if you don't get a policy decision from Iran, you've got to commit yourself perhaps [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=252.26000000000002s)]
*  to revisiting striking the nuclear program as the Iranians begin to spread out and continue [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=256.78000000000003s)]
*  to pursue the nuclear option. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=262.98s)]
*  Here's the one thing, though. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=264.62s)]
*  We have pretty good knowledge of what goes on in Iran, and that good knowledge is going [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=265.62s)]
*  to continue. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=268.86s)]
*  So they're not likely to be able to do something in secret that would suddenly creep up on [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=270.02s)]
*  us. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=274.46s)]
*  We tend to keep very close track of this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=275.46s)]
*  But it comes up again and again in the concern, as we were talking about with our lawmakers, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=278.9s)]
*  this creeping towards a broader war, this creeping towards America getting drawn in [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=283.14s)]
*  to a war that Israel started to take out Iran's nuclear program. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=289.3s)]
*  I'm not asking about the intent of the state itself, but what is the end goal here? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=294.46s)]
*  How do you judge success? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=300.09999999999997s)]
*  Have you even heard the Israeli government or the U.S. government say what success is? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=301.85999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think we've been pretty clear that we don't want Iran to possess a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=307.46s)]
*  They're close to possessing a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=312.29999999999995s)]
*  I heard all the exchanges back and forth with the other guests on your show this morning [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=313.85999999999996s)]
*  about how close they might or might not have been. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=317.78s)]
*  But I think that's the one absolutely non-negotiable thing here. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=320.14s)]
*  You can get that through an Iranian policy decision to not pursue a nuclear weapon, or [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=323.41999999999996s)]
*  you can get that through removal of that capability to such a level that they can't do it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=326.85999999999996s)]
*  The second case is not the preferable case, obviously. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=331.9s)]
*  There are ways to do this. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=335.41999999999996s)]
*  The one thing I would add about the strike that occurred here over the last few hours, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=337.14s)]
*  it was carefully crafted, narrowly designed against the nuclear program to give Iran room [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=340.73999999999995s)]
*  to maneuver, diplomatic room to maneuver if they want to seek a way out. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=346.97999999999996s)]
*  So I think that was very clever. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=351.14s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=352.78s)]
*  The principal goal of Iranian statecraft is today, as it has always been, survival of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=354.5s)]
*  the regime. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=359.34s)]
*  Under certain of these scenarios, if you go forward and the war widens, I think the survival [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=360.34s)]
*  of the Iranian state is very much on the table. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=364.21999999999997s)]
*  And that's something they're going to want to avoid, Margaret. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=367.26s)]
*  But as you were just saying, there's no clear succession plan that the U.S. knew of, at [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=369.82s)]
*  least recently, and they can't get a hold of the boss. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=373.97999999999996s)]
*  He's in a bunker. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=377.05999999999995s)]
*  So how do you actually get a policy decision, and then can orders actually be given? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=378.2s)]
*  So it's a very difficult time for Iran right now. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=384.96s)]
*  I acknowledge all your points. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=388.2s)]
*  But the commanding remains alive, at least as far as I know. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=390.64s)]
*  He remains alive. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=394.52s)]
*  He's probably having trouble having meetings. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  He's probably having trouble getting his orders followed. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  But he still asserts that he's in charge, as of a couple of days ago. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=399.53999999999996s)]
*  And I don't think we've made any effort to strike him, nor have the Israelis. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=403.28s)]
*  Well, right. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=407.88s)]
*  And CBS had been reporting that President Trump advised the Israelis not to take out [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=409.64000000000004s)]
*  the Supreme Leader. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=415.04s)]
*  We'll leave it there, and we'll be right back. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hYfbixK-Q&t=416.04s)]
