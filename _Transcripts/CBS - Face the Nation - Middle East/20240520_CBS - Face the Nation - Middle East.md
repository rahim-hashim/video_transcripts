# ICC prosecutor seeks arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Hamas leaders
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao)
*  Well, we're going to begin in the Middle East where White House National Security Advisor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=0.0s)]
*  Jake Sullivan is in Tel Aviv meeting with Israeli leaders. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=3.7s)]
*  In a meeting today, Israel's defense minister told him the country plans to expand its operations [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=7.42s)]
*  in Ra'afe as it seeks the return of several hostages who are still being held by Hamas. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=12.3s)]
*  That defense minister, Yoav Gallant, is one of multiple Middle Eastern leaders now being [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=19.72s)]
*  targeted by the international court for alleged war crimes. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=23.98s)]
*  The ICC also seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and putting [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=28.78s)]
*  him on the same plane, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=35.14s)]
*  After Sullivan met with the Saudi crown prince over the weekend, these apparent warrants [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=39.42s)]
*  landed. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=44.32s)]
*  A U.S. official confirmed that they've made significant progress, meanwhile, on forging [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=45.32s)]
*  a bilateral agreement. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Imtiaz Tayyab is in Jerusalem. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=50.68000000000001s)]
*  Imtiaz, will arrest warrants actually be issued for those named by the international criminal [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=54.82s)]
*  court like Netanyahu and Sinwar? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=60.58s)]
*  Liliya, Tony, good to be with you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=63.42s)]
*  And that's a very good important question. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=67.97999999999999s)]
*  And the short answer is not necessarily. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=70.02s)]
*  The way this works is the application for the warrants will now go to one of the pre-trial [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=72.4s)]
*  chambers in the ICC and will be decided on by a panel of three judges who currently come [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=76.92s)]
*  from countries like Romania, Benin and Mexico. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=82.8s)]
*  Now to be clear, and again, this is not a foregone conclusion that they will approve [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=86.36s)]
*  all of the ICC chief prosecutor Kareem Khan's request. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=90.96s)]
*  But legal scholars do point out that the threshold of evidence for a warrant at the ICC is just [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=95.3s)]
*  reasonable grounds to believe rather than beyond a reasonable doubt, which of course [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  is the standard for conviction at other trials. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=108.44s)]
*  Now legal analysts also add that these prosecutors are very clearly do not want to mess this [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=111.74s)]
*  up, especially such an important case that so many people are looking at. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  So many do believe that the judges will agree on the warrants. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=122.1s)]
*  However, a huge amount of global political pressure is likely to descend on those three [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=126.66s)]
*  judges in the days to come. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=132.29999999999998s)]
*  And as you said, Imtiaz, this is not just an important case, it's historic. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=134.62s)]
*  It's the first time the ICC has targeted the top leader of a close U.S. ally. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=138.44s)]
*  How have responses been so far, especially in the West? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=143.7s)]
*  Yeah, look, if these warrants are issued by the ICC, it will be one of the most consequential [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=148.28s)]
*  moments in its history since it was established in 2002. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=155.96s)]
*  Because it is the first time it will have sought to hold a close ally of the West, specifically [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=161.18s)]
*  the U.S., to account. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=166.32s)]
*  Now in his statement, Mr. Khan made a point of saying, and I'm quoting here, international [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=168.42s)]
*  law, or rather international law and the laws of armed conflict apply to all. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=173.2s)]
*  But let's be clear, Israel and its supporters are already furious at this, and most consequentially, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=178.77999999999997s)]
*  House Republicans in the U.S. will likely pursue sanctions against members of the ICC if this [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=185.27999999999997s)]
*  goes forward. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  In fact, a group of a dozen or so Republican senators wrote a letter to Khan earlier this [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=193.62s)]
*  month warning his office at the ICC against just this, and they wrote, and again I'm quoting [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=199.18s)]
*  here, target Israel and we will target you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there are a lot of big questions here. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=210.86s)]
*  The International Criminal Court does not count as a party state. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=213.56s)]
*  The United States, Israel, China, Iran, India, I mean the credibility of the court is already [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=217.36s)]
*  in question lacking that kind of support. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=222.52s)]
*  And now there's this putting Israeli leaders in the same category as what the U.S. considers [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=224.94s)]
*  to be the leaders of a terror group. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=229.82000000000002s)]
*  It's definitely a questionable decision. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=231.78s)]
*  One thing I think a lot of people are watching here, I'd love to get your reporting on, is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=233.94s)]
*  this potential deal with Saudi Arabia where normalization would happen with Israel and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=238.06s)]
*  maybe there'd be support for a Palestinian state. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=242.32000000000002s)]
*  I think a lot of people are rooting for this as kind of a Hail Mary solution to the conflict [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=244.54000000000002s)]
*  there. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=248.82000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, in fact, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan was here in Israel. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=251.3s)]
*  He met with Prime Minister Netanyahu just yesterday again to pressure him to accept [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=257.56s)]
*  a political solution to the war in Gaza that, as you say Tony, would lead to a regional [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=262.36s)]
*  deal with Saudi Arabia, the Middle East's most powerful country. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  Now, this is one of the Biden administration's top goals and it revolves around an ambitious, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=272.64s)]
*  rather three-way agreement that would involve the security agreement between the U.S. and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=279.1s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, a normalization of diplomatic relations between the Saudis and Israel, and [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=284.22s)]
*  peace between Israelis and Palestinians leading to an independent Palestinian state. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=291.22s)]
*  But Mr. Netanyahu has made it clear time and again, he is opposed to a Palestinian state, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=297.54s)]
*  something the extremists and his far-right coalition government are also opposed to. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=303.9s)]
*  So it seems for now that this prize that the Biden administration is very, very, very [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=308.56s)]
*  interested in seems a very long way off and potentially impossible with this current Israeli [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=314.20000000000005s)]
*  government. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=321.08000000000004s)]
*  Tony. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  Netanyahu's time may be short as well and it is a Hail Mary, but a lot of people are [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=323.08000000000004s)]
*  rooting for it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=327.12s)]
*  Peace can come out of catastrophe and we've definitely seen catastrophe on both sides. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  MTS Tyab, thank you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eH9Wba2Ao&t=332.32000000000005s)]
