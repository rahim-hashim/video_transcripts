# Iran admits U.S. bombs caused serious damage to its nuclear sites
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY)
*  Let's turn now to the Middle East, where Iran's foreign minister admits U.S. bombs [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=0.0s)]
*  inflicted serious damage to the country's nuclear sites. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=4.32s)]
*  Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan spoke with Rafael Grossi, the director general [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=7.84s)]
*  of the International Atomic Energy Agency, about the status of Iran's nuclear program. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  There is an agreement in describing this as a very serious level of damage. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=19.12s)]
*  The image is clear that what happened in particular in Fordow, Natanz, Isfahan, where Iran used [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=24.88s)]
*  to have and still has to some degree capabilities in terms of treatment, conversion and enrichment [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=33.36s)]
*  of uranium have been destroyed to an important degree. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=42.56s)]
*  Some is still standing. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=51.0s)]
*  So there is, of course, an important setback in terms of those capabilities. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=53.66s)]
*  This is clear. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=60.94s)]
*  The important thing is what are the next steps. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=62.17999999999999s)]
*  Our MTS Tyav is in Tehran with the latest. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=67.46s)]
*  I spoke with him just a short while ago. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=70.22s)]
*  MTS, you have this unique access on the ground in Iran. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=72.42s)]
*  What are people telling you about their concerns or their fears? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=78.64s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having us. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=82.64s)]
*  Look, Iran is a difficult place to report from. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=86.44s)]
*  We are, of course, invited by the Iranian government, but they are very clear as to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=90.4s)]
*  where we can go and what we can do. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=96.4s)]
*  But of the people we have been able to speak to, you know, they've told us that they've [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=99.12s)]
*  just endured 12 days of war in which over 600 people were killed, neighborhoods were [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=103.16s)]
*  badly devastated. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  And they tell us that while they are very afraid, they're also feeling a real sense [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=111.64s)]
*  of unity with each other. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=116.0s)]
*  This is a bitterly polarized society. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  Some people want reform. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=120.58s)]
*  Other people are described as hardliners. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=122.02s)]
*  But what they all can agree on is that they don't want to be bombed by a foreign country. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=124.17999999999999s)]
*  They want to decide for themselves what the future will be for Iran, and that is not to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=129.48s)]
*  be bombed by any other state. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=134.16s)]
*  Are they cynical this ceasefire is going to hold? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=136.32s)]
*  I think there's deep concern about what could happen next. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=140.84s)]
*  The reality is, is there's very little trust in Israel here in Iran. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=145.84s)]
*  Many fear that Israel will look for some sort of pretext to carry out strikes against this [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=151.72s)]
*  country. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=158.56s)]
*  But again, people are telling us that they will continue to resist any outside forces, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  that whatever struggles Iranians may face within their borders is something that they [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=165.88s)]
*  want to work on together. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=170.46s)]
*  But again, there is a very deep concern here that this ceasefire, which has been described [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=173.12s)]
*  as fragile, is just that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=178.4s)]
*  Can you tell if people there are getting outside voices or if they're only able to consume [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=180.72s)]
*  curated, sanitized information? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=185.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty difficult to get outside information. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  In fact, up until yesterday, most of Iran's internet was shut down, bar the use of some [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=191.68s)]
*  messaging apps. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=198.4s)]
*  It was really difficult to get on any websites, and we know that that has been easing. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=199.4s)]
*  Of course, there's state media here. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=205.08s)]
*  But again, getting access to information elsewhere isn't always easy, but Iranians are quite [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=207.66s)]
*  industrious people. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=213.04s)]
*  They have figured out ways to get information from other countries and other news sources. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=214.34s)]
*  But again, many Iranians are looking within their country, looking at what they describe [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=220.1s)]
*  as a trauma that they've endured collectively and are trying to figure out a path forward, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=225.16s)]
*  a path that doesn't see war on the horizon. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=230.34s)]
*  Just superb work there this week in Iran. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=234.26s)]
*  MTS, thank you very much. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=236.66s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61fvVBPcgyY&t=237.66s)]
