# Father of American held by Hamas shares takeaways from White House meeting
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c)
*  Vice President Harris met today with relatives of American hostages taken by Hamas October 7th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's bring in Jonathan Decalchen from the White House. His son has been captive, has been a [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=6.72s)]
*  hostage ever since October 7th. Jonathan, you met with the vice president. What was your big takeaway [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=12.32s)]
*  from that meeting? What did you learn or what did you hear that was most striking? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=19.36s)]
*  Well, Scott, I would go more with the, less with the details than the sort of the general atmosphere. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Our private conversations up to now with administrative, with administration officials [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=34.08s)]
*  have remained private and I think that's important to note because we have a kind of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  active partnership with them. From the vice president, we heard absolute support and absolute [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=44.96s)]
*  understanding and listening, listening to us. We were absolutely heard today with our concerns, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  our fears, our curiosity about how the administration is moving forward and we got [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  some more clarity as well about the deal, the hostage deal that is on the table now and awaits [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=64.32s)]
*  Hamas's response. What are you telling the administration officials you'd like the U.S. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=70.96s)]
*  and Israeli governments to do? Well, I think the U.S. administration, we'll start with the easier [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=77.12s)]
*  part. The U.S. administration clearly from the day after the massacre on October 7th, we've [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  felt entirely supported by the U.S. administration and the door has been open and what we've asked [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=92.4s)]
*  for, what we've suggested over time has certainly been well received by the administration. They are [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=99.76s)]
*  at maximum effort. We have no doubt. The deal that has been tabled right now and that has gone back [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=106.64s)]
*  to Hamas's leadership is a U.S. initiative. So we really couldn't ask for more on that account. It [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=114.72s)]
*  remains to be seen. If, God forbid, Hamas rejects as it has before this deal, we will have to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  gather again with the U.S. administration to see what comes next. As far as the Israeli government [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=128.24s)]
*  is concerned, we have had as Israeli American citizens, we have had our concerns as to how [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=135.76s)]
*  serious Benjamin Netanyahu's government is truly engaged in getting the hostages back versus the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=142.24s)]
*  conduct of the war against Hamas. What we have seen is that through this deal and through Israeli [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=150.08s)]
*  agreement to this deal that was now proposed to Hamas, that the Israeli government has gotten [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  the idea and does understand that it needs to come to the table, it needs to negotiate, and it [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=164.16s)]
*  will probably demand some kind of painful compromise. After all, we're dealing with a [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=171.12s)]
*  murderous terrorist organization in Hamas that in some senses has the final say here. But we've [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=175.6s)]
*  been encouraged in recent days by the willingness of the Israeli government to do those things that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=185.12s)]
*  it must to move this process forward to get the hostages home alive. Your son, Sege, who is himself [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=191.52s)]
*  a father, has now been captive for at least six months and two days. What's the last proof of life [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=198.96s)]
*  you've been given for your son? The last proof of life came with some of the released hostages. If [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=208.24s)]
*  you recall, in late November, early December, a group of 100 of the hostages were released in an [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=215.44s)]
*  earlier deal. Of those 100, about 40 women and children were from my kibbutz, kibbutz near Oz, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=222.72s)]
*  which is on the border with Gaza. A number of the women and a couple of the teenagers were able to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=229.12s)]
*  report to us that they had encountered Sege a couple days before their release in the hellhole [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=235.2s)]
*  tunnels underneath Gaza. It's true also for many of the other hostages who we knew were alive at [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=241.44s)]
*  the time. The tragedy, of course, is that as we learned a couple of days ago with the announcement [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  of the murder of Elad Katsir, who was also a 47-year-old man, a friend, another member of our [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=252.8s)]
*  kibbutz, that is no guarantee. A proof of life from months ago is absolutely no guarantee of the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=259.76s)]
*  health and safety of any of the hostages. So the urgency is clear. Whatever we knew [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=266.96s)]
*  months ago really has no bearing on what might be their condition right now. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=275.12s)]
*  After meeting with the Vice President on the North Lawn of the White House now, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=280.88s)]
*  Jonathan Dekelkhen, I'm sorry we have to keep speaking under these circumstances, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=284.0s)]
*  but we appreciate your making time for us and your continued advocacy. Thank you very much. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=287.67999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you for keeping public eye on this issue. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7k6gL2t7c&t=292.47999999999996s)]
