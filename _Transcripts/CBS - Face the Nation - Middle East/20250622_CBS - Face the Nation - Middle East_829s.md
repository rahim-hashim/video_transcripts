# Karim Sadjadpour on how the war with Israel is playing out inside Iran
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8)
*  So, Karim, what are you hearing about what's happening inside Iran right now? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=0.0s)]
*  I think, initially, the population was in awe of how quickly Israel was able to eliminate [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  senior Iranian military commanders, whom they always had identified with repression. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=12.32s)]
*  But what's transpired in the last several days is that this has become an urban war, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=18.34s)]
*  which has profoundly disrupted life for certainly citizens of Tehran. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=23.88s)]
*  And I think a majority of the population now is living in fear and anxiety. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=28.82s)]
*  Fear and anxiety about what? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=34.1s)]
*  You know, Israelis have been used to missile wars for a long time now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=36.5s)]
*  For Iranians, this generation of Iranians hasn't experienced anything like this since [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=42.22s)]
*  the 1980 to 1988 Iran-Iraq War. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=47.46s)]
*  So this is very new for Iranians. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=51.94s)]
*  For the last decades, the Iranian regime had been prosecuting a war against Israel from [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=53.82s)]
*  Arab soil. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=58.8s)]
*  So it was Lebanese and Iraqis and Syrians who were paying the brunt of that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=59.8s)]
*  This is the first time the Iran-Israel war has come to Iranian soil. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=64.14s)]
*  The Israeli prime minister has said in public statements the Iranian people should rise [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=69.22s)]
*  up against this regime. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=73.56s)]
*  Is there any chance that happens? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=76.28s)]
*  You know, while people are living under aerial bombardment, they're not thinking about waging [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=78.74000000000001s)]
*  political protest. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=83.26s)]
*  They're thinking about survival. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=84.26s)]
*  They're thinking about, you know, taking care of their families. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=85.94000000000001s)]
*  So I don't think it's on the top of people's heads right now to wage political protests. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=89.7s)]
*  But what we know from history is that sometimes when authoritarian regimes get involved in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=95.54s)]
*  foreign entanglements and they lose those foreign wars, it can actually hasten their [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=99.9s)]
*  demise. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=105.06s)]
*  So there are examples of that in history. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=106.06s)]
*  There are also examples of the opposite, where authoritarian regimes are invaded from the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=109.06s)]
*  outside and it actually serves to prolong their shelf life. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=113.58s)]
*  The Iranian regime, the military, has turned against the Iranian people before. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=117.64s)]
*  Is there any chance that there's opposition? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=123.62s)]
*  There certainly remains profound opposition to the Islamic regime. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=127.78s)]
*  I suspect that perhaps 80 percent of Iranian citizens are opposed to a regime which has [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=132.18s)]
*  very few redeeming qualities. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=138.4s)]
*  It's essentially a socially repressive police state and an economic basket case. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  So it's not that a lot of citizens want to live under that type of system. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  But at the end of the day, as far as we know, and it's difficult to tell from afar, but [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=151.16000000000003s)]
*  as far as we know from afar, it's a regime which remains united, highly armed, highly [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  organized, and willing to kill en masse to stay in power. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  And it's a society, despite their profound discontent, but it's a society which is unarmed, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=166.52s)]
*  unorganized, and not willing to die to take power. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=173.28s)]
*  It's a regime which believes in martyrdom, but a society which doesn't. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=178.0s)]
*  Iranian people want to separate mosque and state, not join mosque and state. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=182.0s)]
*  So if we look at the Supreme Leader, who is the ultimate decision maker, he's 86, he's [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=187.08s)]
*  got cancer. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=194.4s)]
*  Is he really going to be deciding the future of this country right now? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=196.24s)]
*  I think we're really, let me put it this way, we're really in a, in my view this right now [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=201.12s)]
*  is less a conflict between two nations, America and Iran, but a test of will between two men, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=209.88000000000002s)]
*  79-year-old Donald Trump and 86-year-old Ayatollah Khamenei. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=218.68s)]
*  And Ayatollah Khamenei is one of the longest serving dictators in the world, so on one [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=223.36s)]
*  hand he has survival instincts. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  If he was a reckless gambler, he wouldn't become the longest serving dictator in the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=230.84s)]
*  world. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=235.44000000000003s)]
*  So on one hand he has survival instincts, but at the same time he has long had these [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=235.8s)]
*  defiant instincts. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=240.96s)]
*  He believes that if you compromise when you're being threatened and pressured, that doesn't [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=242.42000000000002s)]
*  alleviate the pressure, it projects weakness and will invite even more pressure. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=247.42000000000002s)]
*  So these two key sources of identity for him right now are in great tension, his survival [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=251.7s)]
*  instincts and his defiant instincts. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=258.5s)]
*  So if the U.S. joins this attack on Iran, what happens next? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=261.7s)]
*  It really depends on how all of this plays out, but what's being talked about right now [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=268.86s)]
*  is the United States dropping a bunker buster on Iran's Fordo nuclear facility, a 30,000 [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=273.68s)]
*  pound bomb. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=280.98s)]
*  And Iran will need to think very carefully about how it would respond to the United States [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=282.90000000000003s)]
*  dropping a bomb on that Fordo facility, because many of the options that Iran has for retaliation [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=289.90000000000003s)]
*  are the tactical equivalent of a suicide bombing. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  It'll do real damage to America, to Israel, to Iran's Arab neighbors, but it would have [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=300.54s)]
*  profoundly damaging effect on Iran because of the blowback it would invite. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  If Iran were to strike the United States? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=312.64s)]
*  Well, there's a whole host of options you could think about for Iran's retaliation. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=314.64s)]
*  They could try to go after American bases and American embassies throughout the Middle [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=321.0s)]
*  East. They could try to go after American soft targets. They would perhaps try to disrupt [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=325.64s)]
*  global trade corridors like the Strait of Hormuz. They could try to go after oil installations [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=331.14s)]
*  throughout the Persian Gulf, launching a barrage of missiles against either Israel or our partners [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=337.53999999999996s)]
*  in the Gulf, countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=345.09999999999997s)]
*  These would all be incredibly destructive options, which would cause real damage. But [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=348.41999999999996s)]
*  the question for Iran, if their goal is to survive, and this is a regime which ultimately [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=354.41999999999996s)]
*  they're homicidal but not suicidal, they want to stay in power, do they think that they [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=360.36s)]
*  could get away with that without triggering a massive U.S. retaliation? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=364.68s)]
*  If they're homicidal, not suicidal, why would the Supreme Leader turn down the chance of [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=370.6s)]
*  a lifeline that Donald Trump offered in the form of a diplomatic deal? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=375.64000000000004s)]
*  The Supreme Leader has spent, when you consider both sunk costs and opportunity costs and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  penalties of its nuclear program, perhaps around $500 billion on this nuclear program, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=385.78000000000003s)]
*  which only provides around 2 percent of Iran's energy needs. So they've made enormous investment [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=391.58000000000004s)]
*  in this nuclear program, and it's very difficult for him to simply give it up entirely, to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=398.66s)]
*  dismantle it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=405.02000000000004s)]
*  And second, the argument, the second, the pitch that was made, the diplomatic pitch [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=406.74s)]
*  that was made to the Iranian regime was that this is the Libya model, which is you totally [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=413.44000000000005s)]
*  dismantle your nuclear program. Well, that ended very poorly for Libya's dictator, Muammar [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=418.20000000000005s)]
*  Gaddafi. He ended up dying. He was killed by his own population. And so for dictatorships [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=423.68s)]
*  like the Islamic Republic of Iran, and frankly Saddam Hussein was in this position as well, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  for most dictators, when you're given a choice between unconditional surrender, which is [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=437.52s)]
*  what President Trump demanded of Iran's Supreme Leader, or continued defiance, they usually [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=443.85999999999996s)]
*  choose option two because they believe that unconditional surrender would be too humiliating [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=450.24s)]
*  for them in the eyes of their own population. And that oftentimes ends very badly for them, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=457.0s)]
*  as we saw in the example of Saddam Hussein. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=463.06s)]
*  CBS has reported that the Israelis were considering taking out the Supreme Leader. Who would [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=465.58s)]
*  succeed? How many if he is gone? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=471.58s)]
*  You know, when we, what we've seen certainly in the last couple of decades in the Middle [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=474.62s)]
*  East is that authoritarian transitions rarely lead to democratic outcomes. You know, when, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=480.65999999999997s)]
*  especially when it's authoritarian transitions triggered by outside military action. So [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=489.66s)]
*  it's my view that what we've seen in Iran over the last decades has been this theocratic [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=496.54s)]
*  regime's transformation from a clerical dictatorship, a country ruled by the clergy, into a military [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=503.54s)]
*  dictatorship, a country ruled by the Revolutionary Guards. And if Khomeini is killed or drops [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=510.54s)]
*  dead next week, I think the next very powerful leader of Iran is very unlikely to be wearing [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=518.02s)]
*  a turban, much more likely to be someone who's wearing military garb or someone who has a [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=525.88s)]
*  background in either the intelligence or security forces. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=531.02s)]
*  In other words, what comes next could be an even harder line leader? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=535.54s)]
*  It's possible that if this Supreme Leader is killed or he leaves the scene in the coming [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=541.62s)]
*  weeks, that what, you know, you could well have a power vacuum in Iran. So it's not to [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=547.86s)]
*  say that there will be a swift transition to another system. But when the dust settles [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=554.26s)]
*  after such a transition, it's possible that you could have a regime which is ruled by [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=562.0600000000001s)]
*  military men who may actually decide to take an even more aggressive approach in trying [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=568.34s)]
*  to acquire nuclear weapons. Because, you know, you look around at the world and the example [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=574.98s)]
*  that many authoritarian regimes have observed is that leaders in countries which gave up [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=581.0600000000001s)]
*  their nuclear option, whether that was or didn't acquire a nuclear weapons option like [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=588.46s)]
*  Baddafi's Libya, Saddam Hussein's Iraq, Ukraine prior to the transition to the Soviet Union, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=593.62s)]
*  you know, those countries all made themselves vulnerable to external intervention. Whereas [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=601.14s)]
*  dictatorships like Kim Jong-un and the North Koreans have this nuclear cloak of immunity. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=606.26s)]
*  So I think the lesson that many dictatorships could draw from this experience and the experience [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=612.06s)]
*  of others is that it's better to have nuclear weapons than to not have them. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=618.0s)]
*  So if the United States drops, even if it's just one bomb on Fordow, does it then own [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=623.4s)]
*  the problem in Iran of what comes next? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=629.4399999999999s)]
*  Bombing Fordow could certainly delay Iran's nuclear ambitions. But as long as this current [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=632.98s)]
*  regime is in power, it won't end their ambitions. It delays them. But they likely will feel [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=639.98s)]
*  even more importantly about trying to acquire a nuclear deterrent. And they're likely to [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=648.4s)]
*  be much less amenable to allowing international inspectors into Iran. So bombing Fordow is [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=654.6s)]
*  not the end of Iran's nuclear program. It will start a new chapter of them redoubling [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=661.6800000000001s)]
*  their efforts and United States and our allies trying to impede those efforts. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=669.48s)]
*  If there is a shot at diplomacy, if the regime comes to the table and offers to have a civilian [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=676.62s)]
*  nuclear program at the end of the day, who can enforce that? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=683.98s)]
*  Let me say something that might be useful context. So we now have a 46-year case study [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=689.26s)]
*  of the Islamic Republic of Iran and we can count on probably two fingers the number of [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=697.1800000000001s)]
*  times this regime has compromised over the last five decades. And the conditions under [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=701.86s)]
*  which they compromise are pretty clear. Number one, they're faced with overwhelming economic [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=708.0s)]
*  pressure. Number two, they're faced with a credible military threat. Number three, they're [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=713.36s)]
*  facing a united diplomatic front. And number four, importantly, they're provided a face-saving [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=718.0600000000001s)]
*  diplomatic exit. Those first three conditions arguably exist now. There's a credible military [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=725.8199999999999s)]
*  threat. The regime is under enormous economic pressure and it's largely isolated. What we [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=732.4599999999999s)]
*  haven't yet seen is whether they've been provided a clear, concrete, viable diplomatic exit. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=738.3399999999999s)]
*  And the president's call for them to unconditionally surrender is not that idea. It's a regime [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=745.34s)]
*  which humiliation in some ways is fatal for any dictatorship as a foreign war. Humiliation [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=757.94s)]
*  for them could be internal death. So that's something that they want to avoid. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=768.26s)]
*  And so the big question is, what is an outcome that the United States could live with? What [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=772.56s)]
*  is an outcome that Israel could live with? At the moment, I think we arguably have peak [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=778.3399999999999s)]
*  leverage because you have a regime which has been humiliated and decimated militarily over [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=784.2199999999999s)]
*  the last week. And it's an existential moment for the supreme leader. And so the question [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=791.3s)]
*  is, can we offer him something to climb down the ladder rather than risk a war which, as [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=799.0s)]
*  we've seen over the last two decades, it's easy to start these wars. Militarily, Iran [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=810.3199999999999s)]
*  is no match for the United States, but you're opening up a Pandora's box which could potentially [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=817.7199999999999s)]
*  be with us for years to come. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds-rjoBS6j8&t=824.72s)]
