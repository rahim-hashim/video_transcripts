**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [December 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE)
*  We have to turn to the war in Gaza and our Remy in Essencio who has the latest from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=0.0s)]
*  Chasing a UNA truck that had just crossed in from Egypt this morning, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=7.04s)]
*  hundreds of desperate Gazans ransacked it and ran off with boxes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=10.96s)]
*  This morning too, a breakthrough in aid. Israel will now allow UNA trucks to drive directly into [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=15.92s)]
*  Gaza from the Karim Shalom crossing. While Israel's military pressed ahead with its bombardment [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=21.84s)]
*  across the 25-mile strip. They are without water, without food and there is a sniper inside the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=27.44s)]
*  compound. A UK member of parliament said an Israeli sniper has pinned down her Christian family [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  and more than 50 disabled people in Gaza's only Roman Catholic church. There's a woman and a [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=40.24s)]
*  daughter who have been killed. Nearby at northern Gaza's last functioning hospital, withdrawing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=46.56s)]
*  tanks and troops left behind devastation. We don't have houses or relatives anymore, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=52.72s)]
*  said this woman. Where should we go? While in the south in Khan Yunis, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  medics say dozens of dead killed by airstrikes arrived at Nasser hospital over the weekend. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=64.56s)]
*  Outside, dozens of mourners buried another journalist. Samar Abu Dhaka worked for Al-Jazeera [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=70.4s)]
*  television. At least 64 journalists have reportedly been killed in this war so far. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=75.84s)]
*  And in the West Bank, Israeli soldiers shot and killed five Palestinians over the weekend, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=81.44s)]

*  Akshav, Akshav in Hebrew, meaning now, now. And put the best offer on the table to get the hostages [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=97.68s)]
*  back alive. Alive. I don't imagine it can be any more urgent than it has been before. Are you angry? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=106.8s)]
*  My anger only aims towards my government. But after admitting its own troops killed three [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=116.48s)]
*  hostages in Gaza Friday, pressure has hit a new high against the prime minister to get the hostages [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=122.72s)]
*  still alive home. We are working with Qatar and Egypt, said Benjamin Netanyahu late Saturday in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=128.48s)]
*  his first acknowledgement that Qatar's prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=135.2s)]
*  met Israel's spy chief, David Barnea, in France Friday, two days after Israel's war cabinet [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=139.83999999999997s)]
*  reportedly denied his offer to restart talks. And here at hostage square, we are learning of more [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=145.6s)]
*  international calls for a ceasefire coming from the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  Germany, which is a major policy shift and adding to the pressure. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=156.32s)]
*  Austin is expected to arrive here tomorrow. It's Remy Innocencio reporting from Israel. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=161.76s)]
*  Our producer Marwan Alhoul has the latest on the devastation in Gaza. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=168.16s)]
*  Good morning. I am here at this point between Rafah and Canoes city behind me. I can hear [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=173.84s)]
*  fire exchange and bombing on this city, which is the main target for the Israeli troops. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=182.72s)]
*  In the other direction, Rafah still have receiving more and more [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=191.92s)]
*  fled people from Canoes city and in the north of Gaza Strip. This city, it's crowded of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=198.64s)]
*  million of new displaced people in this city. If I want to talk about journalists, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  journalists were gathering near Kuwaiti hospitals. They fixed some tents for them [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=216.56s)]
*  and for their families. They're not even tents. I mean, they're just some plastic and some pieces [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=225.84s)]
*  of wood that we put together trying to create what looks like a tent, something to protect us [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=230.88s)]
*  from the cold, even though they don't. Two days ago, the press family lost one of the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=236.64s)]
*  most well-known cameraman, Samer Abou Daka from Al Jazeera News Channel. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36n7xXcxedE&t=246.55999999999997s)]
