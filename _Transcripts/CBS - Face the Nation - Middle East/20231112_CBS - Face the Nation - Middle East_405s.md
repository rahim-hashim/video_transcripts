# Congress can't "play political games" with aid to Israel, Rep. Michael McCaul says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [November 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ)
*  And we spoke earlier today with the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Michael [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=0.0s)]
*  McCaul from Tel Aviv. I know you're wrapping up what has been a pretty quick and busy trip to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=4.0s)]
*  Israel. You met with Prime Minister Netanyahu. Did you get a sense that his government is close [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=10.8s)]
*  to wrapping up this military operation? No, I don't think so. I think it's, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=17.44s)]
*  you know, the airstrikes. I think the ground game is just now starting. And I will say, Margaret, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=23.44s)]
*  when we walked in, the first thing we saw was the horrific Hamas video showing the gruesome [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=29.36s)]
*  killings of these barbaric terrorists. And it was a very intense, kind of powerful [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=38.32s)]
*  moment. You know, the prime minister was in tears, really teary-eyed about what happened. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=45.28s)]
*  And remember, this is sort of like their 9-11. And they want to eliminate the threat, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=53.84s)]
*  as they should. And I think we talked a lot about the ground game, operations, humanitarian, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  and we also met with the minister of defense as well. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=66.16s)]
*  And you just raised humanitarian aid. I know the U.S. is the largest donor to the UN relief [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=70.72s)]
*  agency that operates inside of Gaza. Many in the Republican caucus do not support any aid [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=77.84s)]
*  going to them or to Palestinians, even Palestinian civilians living in Gaza. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=84.64s)]
*  Do you believe that the aid package going through Congress needs to include this kind of help? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=90.72s)]
*  Well, I do. And I think the Israelis do as well. I think, you know, I talked about this with the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  prime minister. They have put a buffer zone in the middle of Gaza to create this humanitarian [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=101.84s)]
*  zone in southern Gaza. They opened up the Rafah Gate that's Egypt. About 100 trucks a day are [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  coming in. But it has to be like food, water, and medicine. It can't be fuel, because Hamas [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=116.56s)]
*  can use that to light their tunnels and operate them. There are still roughly 400 Americans stuck [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=123.2s)]
*  inside of Gaza, according to the State Department. Did you get any update on how they're doing? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=130.32s)]
*  We did. Very sensitive negotiations with the Qatari. They're kind of the lead broker, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=136.48s)]
*  if you will, of this negotiation. You know, I'm meeting with right after this interview with [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=144.32s)]
*  a bunch of families of the hostages, and I met with them in the United States. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  Very dicey issue. I think what Hamas wants would be a swap of prisoners in Israel, Palestinians in [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=153.76s)]
*  exchange for these hostages, both Americans and Palestinians, in the Gaza. That's an ongoing thing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=164.48s)]
*  I hope it can happen. A ceasefire would be very difficult without an agreement to release all hostages. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=174.0s)]
*  To be clear, are the Palestinian Americans who are trapped in Gaza being [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  included in that hostage negotiation? Is that what you're saying as well? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  No, this is a... No, I'm sorry. It's the Palestinians in prison in Israel that are being [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=192.32s)]
*  negotiated in exchange for prisoners of both Israelis and Americans held captive in Gaza. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=202.16s)]
*  Understood. So that Hamas proposal is being entertained. Interesting to know that. I want [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=213.12s)]
*  to ask you about what Congress can deliver in terms of aid to Israel. Do you think that the new [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  speaker of the House has the clout necessary with your caucus to move through a package that includes [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=224.16s)]
*  Israel aid, Ukraine aid, and other national security items? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=231.68s)]
*  Our aid to Israel is urgent in times of the essence. We have to deliver this package. Now, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=235.84s)]
*  I know that we have offsets, and that's fair, but I don't think we can play political games with this [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=242.72s)]
*  to support our ally, because if they fail and we fail, it would have a very bad effect across the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  Middle East. Into Ukraine, that's vitally important as well. So is Taiwan, and so is the last line [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=260.32s)]
*  defense, the southern border. So really, if you think about it, all these threats are really tied [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=268.4s)]
*  together. Now, whether we handle it altogether or separately with, say, Ukraine and border security, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=274.32s)]
*  all that has yet to be figured out. The stage two, if you will, CR that the speaker is trying [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=281.52s)]
*  to implement, I think will actually move the process forward. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, that deadline in terms of government funding is next week, November 17th. Yesterday, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=292.88s)]
*  the speaker made this proposal. It's kind of an unusual way to do it called a laddered short-term [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  funding deal. The White House says it's just not serious and it's a waste of time. Are we going to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=305.44s)]
*  see a government shutdown? Well, you know, we have the power of the purse, and look, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=311.28s)]
*  we need more time. The CRs always hurt the military, always hurt our national security. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=317.44s)]
*  And so the first CR until January could resolve the last four appropriations bills that we can't [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=324.64s)]
*  pass to date. So we could pass those and then have until February to negotiate with the Senate to get [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=332.88s)]
*  this done and put it on the president's test. That will also give us time. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=340.72s)]
*  Right. But first you need the votes to actually pass this. So can Republicans vote together to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=342.88s)]
*  pass this proposal, this short-term funding agreement? We're going to have to. I mean, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=350.24s)]
*  there's no choice here. I mean, the world is on fire from where I sit. It is too, you know, urgent. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=356.4s)]
*  We can't sit back and do nothing. And talking to Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=365.12s)]
*  they needed this yesterday, in his words. Ukraine needed it yesterday. The border, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=371.12s)]
*  for certainly, needed it yesterday. We know that Chairman Xi is threatening Taiwan and the Pacific. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=377.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. So, you know, I think what the Senate's going to do, they're going to come up with a package [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=384.32000000000005s)]
*  probably after Thanksgiving that they will send over to the House. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=389.68s)]
*  Right. And we'll see if that government funding proposal can get passed [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=394.48s)]
*  by next week to avoid that shutdown. Congressman, thank you for joining us from Israel This Morning. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bv4tFuLLVQ&t=399.28000000000003s)]
