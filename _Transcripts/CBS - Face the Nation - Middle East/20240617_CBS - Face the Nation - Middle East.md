# Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dissolves war cabinet
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is dissolving his country's six-member war cabinet. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=0.0s)]
*  The decision follows the departure of two key members of the group at a critical moment for Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=5.2s)]
*  Its military is fully engaged in a war with Hamas in Gaza, and in the north, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=11.1s)]
*  we've told you about those tensions that are escalating along the border with Lebanon [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=15.6s)]
*  as the military exchanges attacks with the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  And there are growing tensions within the Israeli government. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu is condemning his military's decision to enact daily tactical pauses in Gaza [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=27.0s)]
*  to allow humanitarian aid into the enclave. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=33.8s)]
*  For more on this, let's bring in John Donison with our partners at the BBC. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=36.8s)]
*  So, John, what are we learning about Netanyahu's decision to dissolve the war cabinet? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=40.3s)]
*  Well, you have to remember that this war cabinet was set up as an act of unity [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=47.9s)]
*  in the days after the October the 7th Hamas attack. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=52.7s)]
*  Well, that political unity in Israel has now gone. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=55.7s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu is being squeezed from the centre and from the far right. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=59.2s)]
*  So, last weekend, as you say, we had the opposition figure Benny Gantz [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=64.4s)]
*  and his ally Gaddi Isencott quitting the war cabinet. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=69.7s)]
*  Now, that removed two relatively moderate voices and crucially, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=75.0s)]
*  two people with vast military experience and people who I think the Americans were happy [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=79.2s)]
*  to talk to. They thought they could do business with those two men. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=85.1s)]
*  Well, they have now left. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=88.69999999999999s)]
*  And instead, you have the hardline right-wing interior minister, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=90.69999999999999s)]
*  Itamar Ben-Ghavir, demanding a place on the war cabinet. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  Well, Mr. Netanyahu said no, he's not going to do that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=98.89999999999999s)]
*  He's disbanded the group altogether. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=101.8s)]
*  And I think it means basically that there will be more decision-making [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=104.0s)]
*  in the hands of Mr. Netanyahu and a small group of ministers and allies. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=108.1s)]
*  But increasingly, he looks very much an isolated figure politically. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=114.1s)]
*  So how is this expected to impact the way Israel navigates the situation in Gaza? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=119.0s)]
*  And again, as we mentioned, those escalating tensions in the north with Lebanon. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=123.1s)]
*  I don't think the dissolving of the war cabinet will make too much difference, to be honest. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=130.4s)]
*  It's Mr. Netanyahu who is calling the shots, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=137.6s)]
*  both in Gaza and in terms of Israel's response to what's happening on the border with Lebanon and Hezbollah. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=140.8s)]
*  We had a large number of rockets being fired out from Hezbollah at the tail end of last week [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=147.9s)]
*  and over the weekend. That was in response to Israel [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=154.0s)]
*  assassinating a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon last week. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=158.3s)]
*  Today, my colleagues have been up to the border area today and they said it was a little bit quieter, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=163.5s)]
*  although there obviously is great concern from the people who've been living there, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=169.0s)]
*  many of whom who've had to evacuate their homes now for months. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=172.9s)]
*  And there are always fears that Israel could end up fighting a war on another front. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=177.4s)]
*  And that would be a conflict which could be potentially much more serious. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  Hezbollah is a much more powerful force than Hamas, and it could pull in other players in the region. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=189.5s)]
*  So as we mentioned, Prime Minister Netanyahu denouncing his military's decision to implement a daytime tactical pause in Gaza to allow in aid. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=195.9s)]
*  What more can you tell us about the decision? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  And what does this suggest about, really, if there's a power struggle in Israel? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=206.4s)]
*  Well, there's not only political discord, but Benjamin Netanyahu has discord with the military too, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=214.10000000000002s)]
*  because this decision was made by the IDF yesterday morning [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=220.10000000000002s)]
*  and they said they were going to announce a daily tactical pause every day between the hours of 8 o'clock in the morning and 7 o'clock at night. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=225.3s)]
*  And this would be on a specific road that heads in from the Kerem Shalom crossing, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=233.5s)]
*  which is right in the south of Gaza on the border with Israel. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=238.10000000000002s)]
*  And that on this stretch of road about eight kilometers long, there would be this tactical pause in fighting. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=241.3s)]
*  But Mr. Netanyahu has called that decision made by the military unacceptable. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=247.4s)]
*  However, the military today, when asked, they said it had come from the political echelons. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=253.3s)]
*  So we don't really know, but it's Mr. Netanyahu who is running the country, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  but his military seemed to be not entirely in agreement over the best policy in all aspects of coverage in Gaza. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=266.0s)]
*  OK, John Donison, thank you. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHOuKTWYNfA&t=275.2s)]
