# New video released of people suspected of building noose, gallows before Capitol riot
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [March 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k)
*  CBS News has obtained surveillance videos showing what appears to be people erecting a gallows [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=0.0s)]
*  and a noose, which were seen during January 6 during that attack on the Capitol. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=5.04s)]
*  Yeah, this is a congressional investigators who released these images. We'll put them up on the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=9.68s)]
*  screen now. They want to know why no one has been arrested for unlawful assemblage and construction [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=13.6s)]
*  on Capitol grounds. That's the technical violation here. The footage shows a group of people early [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=20.64s)]
*  on the day of the riots entering Union Square Park and they are seen hauling lumber. Hours before, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=26.24s)]
*  former President Trump directly told his supporters to march to the Capitol. He said he'd meet them [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=32.08s)]
*  during his rally in Washington. CBS News congressional correspondent Scott McFarlane has more from Capitol [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=37.44s)]
*  Hill. Scott, talk to us about exactly what the video reveals. This is one of those still stubborn [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=42.959999999999994s)]
*  mysteries from January 6th. We still don't know who left those pipe bombs on Capitol Hill and we [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=50.16s)]
*  don't yet have any information about somebody being arrested for the erection of those gallows. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=55.52s)]
*  That horrifying image on the west front of the U.S. Capitol, the gallows with an orange noose, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  which is an iconography and an illustration of something that really meant racism and hatred for [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=66.72s)]
*  generations in America. We know from the new video obtained by CBS News, some of the construction of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=72.4s)]
*  this gallows happened brazenly in the early morning hours of January 6, 2021. The movement [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=78.48s)]
*  of the lumber through iconic streets of Washington D.C., Independence Avenue, onto the lawn [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=84.72s)]
*  of the Capitol grounds happened in plain sight around the 6 a.m. hour. Then over the course of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=92.32s)]
*  the morning, some wood was impaneled on the west front of the Capitol. Then around the 1 p.m. hour, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=98.32s)]
*  the crossbar and the noose were affixed according to the congressional review. But according to the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  same congressional review, Tony and Lilia, there's been nobody identified as a suspect in this and our [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=109.12s)]
*  CBS News review of 1,300 or so criminal cases associated with January 6 shows none of the named [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=114.48s)]
*  defendants being linked to this. So three years and two months later, this remains a transcendent [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  and troubling mystery for all involved. It's very interesting, Skye. It's also interesting that the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=128.16s)]
*  the potential charge here, as I have it anyway, is unlawful assemblage and construction on the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=133.44s)]
*  Capitol, as though they were building a mailbox or a spice rack and not a gallows. But maybe there'll [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=138.24s)]
*  be other charges once the individuals are identified. I'm curious what the congressional [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=143.2s)]
*  investigators in making all this footage public are hoping to get done. I guess they want tips. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  A few different things. I think tips to start. They'd like to resurface this issue to raise [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=152.32s)]
*  awareness of the issue. But also this congressional subcommittee, which now oversees January 6, a [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=156.48s)]
*  Republican-led subcommittee has been very critical of the previous January 6 select committee. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=161.6s)]
*  They've been trying to accentuate what they believe are issues the previous committee [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=167.44s)]
*  didn't emphasize enough. And they're arguing here this gallows deserve more attention, considering [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=171.76s)]
*  how horrifying it was to so many Americans. But I'll also add this note as you watch some more of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=177.28s)]
*  this footage obtained by CBS News of this group just moving out there so early in the day they are [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=181.92s)]
*  just alone in certain parts of the city as they move these pieces into place. They were setting [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=187.2s)]
*  this up near the construction of the inaugural platform, which was under construction at that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=192.39999999999998s)]
*  same time. And in the dark at 6 30 a.m., maybe they didn't raise the same alerts as they would [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=197.76s)]
*  have if they did it later in the day. And it's also worth emphasizing, Tony and Lilia, the crossbar [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=202.88s)]
*  and the noose, as I mentioned earlier, didn't go up until around the 1 p.m. hour, according to this [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  review. And that's when everything was breaking loose at the Capitol as a mob attacked police. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  So some of this may have been in the background of the fight on the front lines. Scott, I want to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  shift to another topic. The U.S. is facing yet another partial government shutdown deadline this [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=225.04s)]
*  Friday. Where are talks currently like it like a bad college student? They have procrastinated [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=230.32s)]
*  the hardest questions till the very end. There is still a sticking point that they've been punting [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=236.64s)]
*  on ever since this all started in October. These government shutdown deadlines and that is how to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=241.2s)]
*  fund homeland security in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which, of course, includes [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=246.0s)]
*  border protection and border patrol. It all gets tied up into a very toxic political issue. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=251.84s)]
*  So by Friday, they have to figure out a compromise on how to fund the Department of Homeland Security, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=257.12s)]
*  as well as all those other agencies you see there. And the top left one is usually pretty [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=262.72s)]
*  thorny as well. It's the Pentagon, the Department of Defense. We likely should or need to see [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=266.72s)]
*  something on paper by the end of today or tomorrow for them to make this deadline of Friday. And [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=273.12s)]
*  as the afternoon began here in Washington, we have not yet seen anything on paper. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=277.84s)]
*  Scott McFarland, thank you so much. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34xA2e9q-k&t=283.28s)]
