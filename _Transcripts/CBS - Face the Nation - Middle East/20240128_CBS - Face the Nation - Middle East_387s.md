# Biden envoy "very concerned" about another front in Israel-Hamas war
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [January 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8)
*  We turn now to the conflict in the Middle East and the Biden administration's efforts [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=0.0s)]
*  to prevent a regional war. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=3.7800000000000002s)]
*  White House envoy Amos Hoxdeen is with us, and he's been working on a diplomatic accord [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=6.0s)]
*  between Israel and neighboring Lebanon. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=10.26s)]
*  He's also a top advisor to the president on energy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=12.58s)]
*  How concerned are you right now that we are about to see another front open up in this [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=17.28s)]
*  war? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=23.36s)]
*  Well, I think we should all be very concerned about another front. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=24.36s)]
*  In fact, we have a somewhat of a frontal ready. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=27.88s)]
*  So from the beginning of this conflict, the day after October 7, October 8, there was [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  shelling and action coming from Lebanon towards Israel reaction. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=37.82s)]
*  And since then, we've been in a sort of a low grade fight between Israel and Lebanon. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=42.0s)]
*  President Biden has been clear that we want to do everything we can to prevent an escalation [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  of that lower level conflict into an all out conflict that would drag us further into [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=52.32s)]
*  war and risk civilian lives on both sides. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  And that's what we're trying to do is to avoid that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=61.24s)]
*  So Hezbollah has been firing rockets. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=63.78s)]
*  Israel has been carrying out strikes into southern Lebanon. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=66.36s)]
*  You had brokered a maritime border between Israel and Lebanon. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=69.38s)]
*  How close are you to getting a land border negotiated here? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=73.2s)]
*  So just over a year ago, we were able to negotiate a maritime boundary, which is really the first [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=77.2s)]
*  time Israel and Lebanon, who Lebanon doesn't recognize Israel diplomatically, reached any [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  kind of boundary agreement. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=87.16s)]
*  What we need to do now is to get to two things. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=89.24s)]
*  One is the cessation of hostilities across both sides so that people over almost 100,000 [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=91.56s)]
*  people on each side, Lebanon and Israel, are refugees in their own countries because they [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=97.88s)]
*  can't live in southern Lebanon or in northern Israel. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=102.56s)]
*  So we have to get to a cessation of hostilities. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=105.44s)]
*  But post October 7, we also have to make sure that Israelis and Lebanese can live [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=107.88s)]
*  in their homes with security. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=112.8s)]
*  And that is not just a ceasefire. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=114.32s)]
*  It requires a more intricate piece of the negotiations to ensure that the Lebanese army [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=116.08s)]
*  is in that area, that there is more parameters of security for civilians. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=122.6s)]
*  Once we do that, though, we do need to start looking at how do we mark the border, an actual [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=128.04s)]
*  border between the two countries so that we can have long term security and long term [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=134.85999999999999s)]
*  peace in an area that's seen so many rounds of conflict over the last several years. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=138.5s)]
*  And are you headed back soon? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=143.66s)]
*  I will likely head back soon. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=145.34s)]
*  But I think we this is something we do every day, not just when we're in the region. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=147.34s)]
*  We do this also when we're here. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=150.86s)]
*  Because the Israeli government has said time is running short. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=152.18s)]
*  The defense minister said what end of January? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=154.42s)]
*  Well, I don't know about hard deadlines, but the window for diplomacy is definitely there. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=156.62s)]
*  And that is what President Biden has said. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=162.38000000000002s)]
*  We have to try to solve this diplomatically. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=163.82000000000002s)]
*  I don't deny that a status quo of where we are now can last forever. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=166.06s)]
*  And that is why we need to make sure that we can get through diplomatic resolution. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=170.18s)]
*  So oil prices jumped Friday. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=174.62s)]
*  As you know, there was a tanker carrying Russian oil going through the Red Sea that was hit [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=177.06s)]
*  by rockets fired by Houthi militias. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=182.08s)]
*  And we can see here a lot of ships going through that area have had to take longer routes because [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=185.16000000000003s)]
*  of this conflict here. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  How are you gauging the geopolitical risk when it comes to energy prices going forward? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=192.66s)]
*  Well, I think we're in a remarkable situation where we have two global conflicts, one the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=196.7s)]
*  ongoing war of Russia's war against Ukraine and what's happening in the Middle East and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=202.89999999999998s)]
*  the Houthis attacking the ships. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=207.73999999999998s)]
*  So the first thing to remember, we are responding to the Houthi attacks. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=209.92s)]
*  And this is not an attack on the United States or related to Gaza. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=214.29999999999998s)]
*  This is an attack on the global commercial system, on global shipping lanes. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=217.44s)]
*  This is not about just the United States. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=221.8s)]
*  And that's why the reaction has not just been the U.S. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  It's U.S.-led, but this is a coalition and a coalition that's growing, both the diplomatic [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=227.28s)]
*  coalition as well as the military coalition. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=231.82000000000002s)]
*  It's also not stopping the attacks. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=233.44s)]
*  Well, I think that we've seen a reduction in attacks. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=234.84s)]
*  But let's take the example that you gave the ship on Friday. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=237.16000000000003s)]
*  It was not an American ship, not destined for Israel either. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=241.0s)]
*  It's part of the global commercial system. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  It was aided by the U.S. Navy, the French Navy, and the Indian Navy, all vessels that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=247.48s)]
*  were in the area, and saved the ship that was able to then move on safely and securely. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=252.72s)]
*  The impact on the markets, look, I think that there is clearly a sentiment issue where prices [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=259.7s)]
*  have gone up a little bit because of this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=264.88s)]
*  But the actual cost to energy commodities, cargo ships, yes, they have to go around a [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=267.5s)]
*  further distance. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=273.36s)]
*  It's more a logistics cost than it is an actual cost. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=274.36s)]
*  The costs do go up. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=277.82s)]
*  But if you look at what the impact, the inflationary impact, are relatively muted. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=279.14s)]
*  And we're going to continue to work to mitigate and degrade the efforts that the Houthis have [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  to attack, but also make sure that we can look at the global markets and make sure they're [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=290.24s)]
*  not affected. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=294.72s)]
*  So, the Washington Post reported you opposed the decision the White House announced Friday [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=295.72s)]
*  to put limits on some liquefied natural gas projects in order to conduct environmental [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=299.74s)]
*  review. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=305.62s)]
*  First of all, is that true? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=306.62s)]
*  And given that we haven't seen LNG prices really move, how significant can this decision [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=308.62s)]
*  really be? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=313.7s)]
*  It looks very political. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=314.7s)]
*  So first, no, it is totally, I don't know who's saying that I opposed it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=316.66s)]
*  I did not oppose it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=320.98s)]
*  I think this is the right decision. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=322.1s)]
*  In the White House, in the Department of Energy, and across the administration, there was full [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=325.06s)]
*  support for this decision. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=328.94s)]
*  I was one of them. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=330.21999999999997s)]
*  Look, we have to look at this decision for what it is. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=331.54s)]
*  One, we are today the largest exporter of LNG in the world. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=335.78s)]
*  Based on what's under construction, the United States will double our exports of LNG, our [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=341.0s)]
*  capacity to export LNG over the next three, four years. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=346.9s)]
*  So we've already done an enormous amount. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=350.9s)]
*  At some point, you have to stop and say, all right, this is how much we're exporting. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=353.1s)]
*  We now need to look, what are the economic impacts? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=357.88s)]
*  Does the market still need significantly more that will come post 2030? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=360.36s)]
*  And as we learn more, what are the environmental impacts so that we're not just building this [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=365.71999999999997s)]
*  out without looking at all of the parameters that needs to be looked at when we have? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=370.08s)]
*  That's why we do permitting. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=375.7s)]
*  Well, Senator Manchin says he's going to hold some hearings to get answers to the questions [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=376.92s)]
*  on what happened here. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=381.06s)]
*  And we'll watch for that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=382.92s)]
*  And thank you for coming in. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_e8VhGQG8&t=384.68s)]
