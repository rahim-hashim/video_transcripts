*  In central Gaza, 13-year-old Shadi Faraj was playing outside when he was killed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V317XLhcMug&t=46.28s)]

*  home. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V317XLhcMug&t=96.44s)]
*  She had been trampled to death. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V317XLhcMug&t=97.44s)]
