# Trump talks possible Israeli strike on Iran
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo)
*  The U.S. is taking preemptive measures to protect Americans in the Middle East after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=0.0s)]
*  learning that Israel is ready to launch an operation into Iran. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=4.92s)]
*  Iran has warned such an attack could lead to possible retaliation on U.S. bases in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=9.32s)]
*  near-neighboring Iraq and other countries. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Today, the State Department ordered U.S. government workers in Israel to restrict their travel [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=16.68s)]
*  around the country. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=22.48s)]
*  Family members of U.S. military personnel across the Middle East were also authorized [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=24.04s)]
*  to evacuate. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=29.48s)]
*  CBS News national security contributor Samantha Vinograd spoke about the threat of retaliation [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=30.52s)]
*  earlier today. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=36.24s)]
*  Iran is the largest state sponsor of terror in the world and Iran has proxies throughout [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=37.24s)]
*  the Middle East and frankly throughout the world. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=41.8s)]
*  So one ripple effect of Israel does strike Iran is that Iran could activate its proxies [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=44.4s)]
*  in the Middle East and around the world against U.S. and Israeli targets. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  And CBS News senior White House correspondent, Weijia Zhang, joins us now for more on this. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  Weijia, there is significant intelligence sharing between the U.S. and Israel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  So what is the White House saying about these reports that Israel may launch an attack and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=62.2s)]
*  the State Department's warning that we just talked about to some Americans in the Middle East? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=67.4s)]
*  Well, Nancy, just a short time ago, President Trump was explicitly asked about this and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=71.08s)]
*  whether he believed that an Israeli attack on Iran was imminent. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=76.36s)]
*  And he said he did not want to use the word imminent. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=80.76s)]
*  But then he added, it looks like something that could very well happen. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  But he went on to say that he hopes it does not happen as long as there is a chance that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  the U.S. could broker a new nuclear agreement with Iran. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=94.72s)]
*  And he also expressed optimism that that could happen. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=99.84s)]
*  But the president was also directly asked what Israel has told him about a possible [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=103.76s)]
*  attack. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=109.88000000000001s)]
*  And here's what he said. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  They didn't tell me anything, but I said, look, there's a chance of massive conflict. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=112.0s)]
*  We have a lot of American people in this area. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=116.36s)]
*  And I said, we got to tell them to get out because something could happen soon. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=119.16s)]
*  And I don't want to be the one that didn't give any warning and missiles are flying into [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=124.64s)]
*  their buildings. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=128.32s)]
*  And the president reiterated that while he is optimistic, there could still be a deal [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=130.8s)]
*  with Iran that no matter what, there cannot be a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  And so we don't know what the terms are that are being negotiated, but we do know that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=140.68s)]
*  his trusted adviser and Middle East envoy Steve Wittkopf will be having another round [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=144.44s)]
*  of talks to try to get that agreement across the finish line. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=149.56s)]
*  Nancy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=153.44s)]
*  And we did. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=154.44s)]
*  The president is also launching a five million dollar Trump card for permanent U.S. residency. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=155.44s)]
*  What do you know about that? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=160.08s)]
*  Well, he initially called this the gold card, but you're right. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=161.8s)]
*  He's now calling it the Trump card and he's teasing that it is coming soon and that it [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=164.28s)]
*  basically bypasses the traditional protocols that are used to gain citizenship in this [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=168.6s)]
*  country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  Instead, you can hand over five million dollars. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  So right now we're still waiting on many of the details such as how all this would work [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=181.0s)]
*  logistically, what the application process would be like and where all that money would [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=185.44s)]
*  go. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=190.56s)]
*  But he says that it is coming and that he believes it could raise more than a trillion [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=191.56s)]
*  Although we don't know exactly how and we don't know the legality of this, but you can [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=197.36s)]
*  see on your screen there if you go to the website, you see an image of the card that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=202.0s)]
*  he says you can purchase for five million. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=206.44000000000003s)]
*  Certainly eye catching. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  We just thank you very much. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnMSyyJsjHo&t=210.16000000000003s)]
