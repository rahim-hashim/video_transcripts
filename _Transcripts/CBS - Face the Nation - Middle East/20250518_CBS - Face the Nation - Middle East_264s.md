# Rubio on Israel's plan to expand ground operations in Gaza
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ)
*  The president says he wants to end wars, but Israel's prime minister has said he is expanding [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=0.0s)]
*  this ground operation inside of Gaza. The IDF says it's to seize strategic areas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=5.04s)]
*  Does the U.S. fully support expanding this war? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=10.64s)]
*  We expand the destruction of Hamas, the ending of Hamas. We support a future for the people of Gaza [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=16.48s)]
*  that is free of Hamas and full of opportunity. That's what we support. And this is a group that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  came across on October 7th and carried out one of the most vile series of attacks, kidnappings, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=27.12s)]
*  rapes, murders, and hostage-taking that we've ever seen. That's what we support. Now that said, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=31.84s)]
*  we also support an end to the conflict, a ceasefire. We don't want people obviously [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  suffering as they have, and we blame Hamas for that, but nonetheless they're suffering. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=41.52s)]
*  And so we are actively engaged, even as I speak to you now, we are actively engaged in trying to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=45.2s)]
*  figure out if there is a way to get more hostages out through some ceasefire type mechanism. We're [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=49.84s)]
*  not going to do anything to undermine Israel and its security, but by the same token, if there is [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=55.36s)]
*  a possibility here to find a way forward that frees more hostages, including those who are alive, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=59.6s)]
*  but also the bodies to their relatives, and potentially bring about an end to this war in [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  a way that puts the people of Gaza on a pathway of peace and prosperity and being free of Hamas, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=69.76s)]
*  we're going to explore that. We think we've made some progress, but there's more work to be done. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=76.56s)]
*  Ambassador Witkoff is working on that on an hourly basis. It's something we're all very [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=81.44s)]
*  focused on and continue to be very supportive of. And I hope we'll have good news soon in that regard, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=87.2s)]
*  but I think some impediments remain. Are you asking Israel to slow down this military push? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=91.92s)]
*  And the Qatari Prime Minister told Fox News that there was a deal being put together for all [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=99.84s)]
*  hostages or many hostages to be released after Edan Alexander, that American Israeli, was released [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=106.64s)]
*  recently, but then the Israeli military bombed a hospital, killing 70 civilians, and everything [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=112.88s)]
*  went sideways. Is that your understanding of what happened? It was this lack of care of collateral damage? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=119.12s)]
*  No, the way I would characterize it is that this war could end immediately, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=127.92s)]
*  and Israel's made that clear. It could end immediately if Hamas surrenders and gives up [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=131.2s)]
*  their weapons and demilitarizes and releases all the hostages, including the deceased ones. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=135.12s)]
*  They did that. This conflict would end. That's been true from the very beginning. It's been true [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  for months now. They're the ones that have chosen not to accept that offer. That said, we continue [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=143.68s)]
*  to work and do everything we can through diplomatic channels and private means to bring about an end [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=148.56s)]
*  to this conflict in a way that ends Hamas and provides the people of Gaza the opportunity at [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=153.12s)]
*  a prosperous and peaceful future that also ensures Israel's security. We're working on that, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=158.8s)]
*  and we've never stopped working on that. We've never stopped taking efforts to make that possible, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=165.28s)]
*  and that continues. Even as I speak to you now, there are people working on that. We're going to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=169.28s)]
*  continue to do that, and that's the outcome we want to see. Hopefully, the sooner the better. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=174.24s)]
*  The president has said Prime Minister Netanyahu didn't want to end the war. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  The views are quite in contrast. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. No, what the president's... No, no. I think what the president is saying is he doesn't want [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  to end the war until Hamas is defeated. This is a group that is a threat. If an ember survives, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=190.24s)]
*  it'll spark again into a fire. That is the view of... There is no future. There can be no peaceful [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=194.88s)]
*  and prosperous Gaza as long as Hamas governs it by rule of arms. That's a fundamental truth. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=200.72s)]
*  Now, that doesn't mean that there isn't some way that we can achieve that through a ceasefire and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=208.48s)]
*  some peace mechanism. That's what we're trying to accomplish here. Ending Hamas, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=213.36s)]
*  ending its governance of Gaza, ending the conflict, freeing all of the hostages, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=217.36s)]
*  including the bodies of those who have passed away and been killed and murdered by the Hamas [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=221.84s)]
*  terrorists, and then beginning the work of a future for Gaza and also of ensuring Israel's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=226.4s)]
*  security. That's always been our goal. That remains our goal, and that's what we continue [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=231.84s)]
*  to be focused on. But in the absence of that such agreement, we anticipate that Israel will [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=235.84s)]
*  continue forward with their operations. But that doesn't mean we stopped working on trying to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=242.32s)]
*  achieve a peaceful outcome that also protects Israel's security and ends Hamas' governance of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  Gaza so that Gaza can have a free and prosperous future moving forward. That's what the president [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=253.04s)]
*  wants to see as the end goal here. That is the end goal, and that's what we're working on through [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=257.44s)]
*  every means at our disposal. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Cy7BWukxQ&t=261.92s)]
