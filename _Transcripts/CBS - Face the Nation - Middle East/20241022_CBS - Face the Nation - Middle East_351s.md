# Blinken and Netanyahu meet in Israel amid U.S. push for Gaza cease-fire deal
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs)
*  Now to our monitors in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=0.0s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken back in Israel, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  marking his 11th trip to the region [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  since the war in Gaza erupted. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=7.76s)]
*  The secretary sat down with Israeli Prime Minister [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=9.94s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, and that meeting [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=12.4s)]
*  lasted more than two hours. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=14.6s)]
*  The mission of this trip, revive ceasefire negotiations. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=16.78s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Northern Gaza, men, women, and children [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=21.44s)]
*  escaping by foot after evacuation orders [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=25.2s)]
*  from the Israeli military to separate Hamas fighters [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=28.24s)]
*  from civilians. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=32.16s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent, Ramo Innocencio, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=33.68s)]
*  is in Israel for us with more on the secretary's trip. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=36.599999999999994s)]
*  Liz, hi there. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=41.12s)]
*  Yeah, in the past few hours, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=41.96s)]
*  and really all through this afternoon, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=43.54s)]
*  rocket sirens have been sounding throughout Northern Israel. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=45.18s)]
*  And this morning we woke up to air raid alarms here [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=48.44s)]
*  in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=52.14s)]
*  Sirens went off at about 7.45 a.m. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=53.04s)]
*  Then we heard the booms of Iron Dome missile interceptions [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=55.38s)]
*  from our shelters here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=60.02s)]
*  That was just a couple hours before Antony Blinken landed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=61.82s)]
*  Israel's military said that Hezbollah fired [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=65.18s)]
*  about 20 projectiles in total [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=67.58s)]
*  at Northern and Central Israel. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=70.38s)]
*  Just this morning, Hezbollah said that it targeted [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=72.30000000000001s)]
*  multiple sites, and that included an Iron Dome battery [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=74.9s)]
*  near the city here, and that it bombed the base [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=78.66s)]
*  for a military intelligence unit, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=81.18s)]
*  8200, outside Tel Aviv. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=83.74000000000001s)]
*  That unit is understood to be responsible [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=85.62s)]
*  for those pager attacks and those walkie talkie attacks [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  on Hezbollah that we reported last month. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=91.3s)]
*  Now up in Lebanon, President Biden's special envoy [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=93.18s)]
*  is still there trying to work towards a peace [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=95.46000000000001s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=97.42s)]
*  Now as for Secretary Blinken, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=98.94s)]
*  this is his 11th time to Israel in 12 months [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=100.02000000000001s)]
*  to try to find a way to a ceasefire here. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=103.02000000000001s)]
*  And that ceasefire continues to be the same word, elusive. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=105.26s)]
*  The last time he was here was the last time [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=109.66s)]
*  that I was here back in August. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=111.28s)]
*  And since then, we know Israel has opened up [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=112.38000000000001s)]
*  a second front of fighting with Lebanon in the North. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=114.42s)]
*  Iran retaliated against Israel with about 200 missiles. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=117.3s)]
*  We're expecting Israel to retaliate here. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=121.30000000000001s)]
*  We have been on standby, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=124.14s)]
*  and the heads of Hamas and Hezbollah we know are now dead. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=125.22s)]
*  The situation is arguably more tense, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=129.46s)]
*  and the balance of power appears to have shifted [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=131.66s)]
*  to Netanyahu's favor. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=134.98000000000002s)]
*  Blinken is meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=136.7s)]
*  Defense Minister Yoav Galant, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=140.01999999999998s)]
*  and other officials throughout the day [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  before traveling elsewhere in the region [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=143.45999999999998s)]
*  to continue this push for peace. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=145.38s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=148.42s)]
*  Raymond Innocencio from Israel. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=151.62s)]
*  Meanwhile, we're learning new details [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=153.42s)]
*  of that two-hour meeting [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=155.06s)]
*  between Secretary of State Antony Blinken [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  that he held with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=158.98s)]
*  Now during that meeting, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=162.26s)]
*  Blinken underscored the need to capitalize [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=163.45999999999998s)]
*  on the death of Yahya Sinwar, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=166.1s)]
*  including securing the release of all hostages [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=168.14s)]
*  and ending this conflict in Gaza. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=171.33999999999997s)]
*  CBS News contributor Robert Berger joins us now. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=174.33999999999997s)]
*  Robert, there was hope when the news came down [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  that when Yahya Sinwar was killed, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=180.22s)]
*  that there would be incentive [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=182.45999999999998s)]
*  for new talks of a ceasefire with Hamas. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=183.94s)]
*  But in fact, Sinwar's death [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=186.94s)]
*  has made that even more complicated. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  Can you explain why? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=190.73999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you need an address in order to negotiate, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=193.33999999999997s)]
*  and Sinwar was that address. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=196.66s)]
*  He was the undisputed authority and leader of Hamas. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=198.7s)]
*  So he was the one making the decisions [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=202.7s)]
*  on whether to make a deal with Israel on the hostages. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=205.9s)]
*  By the way, he was considered by the US and Israel [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=209.38s)]
*  to be the main obstacle to a deal, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=211.94s)]
*  but at least he was an address. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=215.3s)]
*  He was someone with whom you were negotiating. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=217.06s)]
*  Now the mediators, US, Egypt, and Qatar [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=220.26s)]
*  have to find new interlocutors with whom to discuss a deal [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=225.1s)]
*  and who actually would have the authority to make a deal. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=229.94s)]
*  Now what about those hostages still in Gaza today? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=233.94s)]
*  Is it possible they could be in even more danger [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=236.98s)]
*  now that Sinwar is dead? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=239.74s)]
*  Definitely more danger. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=242.38s)]
*  There's about 100 Israeli hostages left in Gaza, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=243.7s)]
*  of whom about 65 are believed to be alive. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=247.26s)]
*  The problem is, Sinwar, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=250.68s)]
*  he did have control and authority. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  Of course, that's been decimated now with the war, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=255.66s)]
*  but now you don't even know really [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=258.42s)]
*  where all the hostages are most likely. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=261.65999999999997s)]
*  It's believed that they're not only being held by Hamas, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=264.09999999999997s)]
*  but by various clans as well as the Islamic Jihad group, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=267.3s)]
*  and they may all have different demands. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=271.94s)]
*  And also with each passing day, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=274.3s)]
*  there's concern, especially among the families, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=276.14s)]
*  but everyone in Israel, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=278.5s)]
*  about whether they're being held in very bad conditions [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=279.94s)]
*  in these tunnels most likely, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=283.46s)]
*  and there's concern about whether they'll be able [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=285.52s)]
*  to make it home alive. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=288.14s)]
*  And who's gonna step up to be the leader of Hamas? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=290.1s)]
*  As you know, Sinwar, we know he has a brother, Mohammed, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=292.94s)]
*  who is said to be even more brutal, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=295.46s)]
*  if that's even possible, than his brother. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=297.65999999999997s)]
*  Is it possible he will rise up as the new leader of Hamas? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=300.04s)]
*  He said Mohammed has been the one that's been named [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=304.82s)]
*  as the probable successor, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=307.26s)]
*  but there are going to be others [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=308.94s)]
*  who try to take over the helm. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=310.74s)]
*  There's a political leadership in Qatar, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=313.1s)]
*  a couple of leaders there who have been around for a while. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=315.94s)]
*  One name is Khaled Mechal. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=319.0s)]
*  It's really not clear who is going to be able to take over. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=321.88s)]
*  And again, Hamas is a group in disarray right now. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=325.24s)]
*  Their top leadership, both military and political, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=329.26s)]
*  have been assassinated by Israel. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=332.62s)]
*  So, but it does look like whoever takes over, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=335.34s)]
*  most likely they'll continue the hard line of Hamas, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=339.42s)]
*  which is seeking the destruction of Israel. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=342.26s)]
*  CBS News contributor Robert Berger from Jerusalem, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=346.18s)]
*  reporting on Jerusalem. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=349.14s)]
*  Thank you so much, Robert. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Dx89NY3vs&t=350.21999999999997s)]
