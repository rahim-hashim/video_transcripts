# Blumenthal and Graham on Israel, Iran's nuclear program, Russia, Ukraine and more
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU)
*  We're now joined by two senators in a rare bipartisan interview, Republican Lindsey Graham [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=0.0s)]
*  and Democrat Richard Blumenthal. They're co-sponsors on legislation to put secondary [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=4.88s)]
*  sanctions on Russia. Good morning to you both. Good morning. I want to get to that conflict in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  a moment, but starting here on the Middle East. Senator Graham, you said you believe it's in [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=14.24s)]
*  America's interest to go all in to help Israel finish the job. It sounds like you mean offensive [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=18.32s)]
*  So the worst possible outcome for the world is for the Iranian nuclear program to survive [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=25.6s)]
*  after all this. How do you destroy their program? Through diplomacy? I prefer that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=31.52s)]
*  Or through military action? If diplomacy is not successful and we live with the option of force, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=37.28s)]
*  I would urge President Trump to go all in to make sure that when this operation is over, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  there's nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program. If that means providing [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=51.04s)]
*  bombs, provide bombs, if that means flying- Bungling and busting bombs? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=57.12s)]
*  Whatever bombs. If it means flying with Israel, fly with Israel. The worst possible outcome for [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=61.28s)]
*  the world is to take the Iranian nuclear program on and leave it standing. That will be a disaster. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=67.92s)]
*  Senator Blumenthal, what's your view? How involved should the U.S. get? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=75.28s)]
*  Let's begin with the basic proposition that ought to motivate American policy as well as the world's. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=79.12s)]
*  A nuclear-armed Iran is an unacceptable threat to the world, not just to Israel but to the United [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=85.44s)]
*  States as well. And I support Israel's right to defend itself against this existential menace. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=93.36s)]
*  I'm very concerned right now about United States personnel in the region, our servicemen and women, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  but also the civilians that are there. I'm getting phone calls from families in Connecticut [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=106.24s)]
*  who are deeply worried about their children who were there, about the hostage families. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=112.0s)]
*  I support the president's effort to prioritize diplomacy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  Let's talk more about this after the commercial break, so please stay here with us, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=122.0s)]
*  and we'll be right back. And welcome back to Face the Nation. We return now to our conversation [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=126.16s)]
*  with Senators Graham and Blumenthal. Senator Blumenthal, before we get to Ukraine, I just [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=130.88s)]
*  want to tie up the Middle East here. You know, the defense secretary was testifying to Congress [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=136.32s)]
*  this week, and he said he's moved equipment meant to counter drones in Ukraine over to the Middle [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=140.56s)]
*  East now because of this escalation. What more is needed to protect U.S. personnel? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=147.04s)]
*  We need to move assets, and we've done so not only to protect U.S. personnel but also [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=154.4s)]
*  to enable Israel to defend itself against Iran's retaliation. But I think that the president [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=160.4s)]
*  is right to try to bring the two sides together. There is a deal that's possible here if Iran were [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=168.72s)]
*  to abandon its effort to build nuclear bombs that endanger not only Israel but the entire [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=175.44s)]
*  regional stability because all the other Arab nations are going to have nuclear weapons if [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=184.0s)]
*  Iran does as well. But Americans have no interest in a forever war, and so I think we need to be [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=190.16s)]
*  mindful about the priority of diplomacy here and bring the two sides together as well as [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  protecting U.S. personnel. Senator Graham, the thing with diplomacy is that the Israeli [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=204.0s)]
*  prime minister is calling for the Iranian people to rise up against the regime, a regime he says [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  is calling for the destruction of his state. It doesn't really seem like there's a compromise there. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=214.8s)]
*  If it's truly this existential, is this just leading us towards the outcome you say, which [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  is the United States getting involved in military conflict? Well, this is what I would love for the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  regime to fall. If you don't, if you want this regime to stay in power, you're wanting people [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  to oppress the Iranian people. You want people to threaten their neighbors to be the largest states. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=236.32s)]
*  Who wants the largest state sponsor of terrorism to stay in place? But regime change is not the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  policy of the United States. It is not the purpose of this attack yet. But if there's one attack on [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=248.64s)]
*  an American anywhere in the Mideast by Iran, then you'll get regime change. So what are we dealing [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=255.83999999999997s)]
*  with? We're dealing with a non-negotiable part of the deal. They can't have a nuclear program that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=261.76s)]
*  can make a bomb. Diplomacy is preferred, as Dick says, but force may be the only option. And I've [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=267.84s)]
*  said it as clearly as I can say, if diplomacy fails, Mr. President, President Trump, you've been [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=274.32s)]
*  great. Help Israel finish the job. Give them bombs. Fly with them if necessary. I cannot stress to you [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=280.32s)]
*  how, if you want to get Russia right, you want to make China be better, you want to convince [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=286.56s)]
*  international terrorism, we mean business, you got to finish the job with Iran. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=292.0s)]
*  Well, we'll see if there's any willingness to negotiate. So far we haven't seen much. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=297.68s)]
*  That's a big mistake on Iran's part. It's not on President Trump's. If we don't have negotiations, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=302.32s)]
*  it's not because of Trump. It's because of the Ayatollah. Or you can't necessarily bomb someone [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=306.96s)]
*  into concessions that they were not willing to make, right? Yeah, I don't think they have any [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=312.8s)]
*  desire to make concessions. If Iran miscalculates now, it will face the consequences. But there is [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=318.4s)]
*  a road to a deal. President Obama reached a deal far from perfect. President Trump ripped it up. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=325.36s)]
*  If it were in effect, maybe we could have stopped the Iran nuclear buildup, which has occurred. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=335.68s)]
*  There are close to 10 bombs now. But there is the possibility of diplomacy in the meantime. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=342.72s)]
*  The United States ought to provide the means for Israel to defend against this Iranian retaliation. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=348.64s)]
*  Just to clarify, when you say close to 10 bombs, you mean they would have enough nuclear fuel. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=353.6s)]
*  But as far as we know from the US assessment, they hadn't made the political decision to turn [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=358.64000000000004s)]
*  that into a weapon. We didn't hear that from the Senate Intel chair when they asked that. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=362.56s)]
*  What purpose is there for enriched uranium at 60% other than making a weapon? Why do you have 900 [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  pounds of this stuff if you don't want to make a weapon? Well, you know, the assessment was they [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=374.48s)]
*  wanted the leverage, right? Yeah, right. Whatever. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=378.32s)]
*  I want to ask you about the bipartisan work you are both doing, if I can. By the way, Iran and Russia. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=381.76s)]
*  We're bipartisan on this. We say the same. You are. Iran and Russia work together. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=388.88s)]
*  If I can just add one more point about Iran, because we're going to talk about Russian sanctions, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=392.88s)]
*  I think we ought to strengthen sanctions against Iran, which is a non-kinetic, a peaceful means of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=398.56s)]
*  exerting pressure. I'm hoping that perhaps Senator Graham and I... I will be your wingman. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=405.84s)]
*  We'll write the bill right here on television. China, if you're listening, stop buying Russian [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=410.23999999999995s)]
*  oil and stop helping the Iranians. You'd make the world a safer place if you would stop. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  They buy it because it's cheap, though. Yeah, they... Well, you know. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  Then they should pay a price for propping up Putin's war machine. We should crush their economy. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=422.79999999999995s)]
*  Okay. So tell me about that. So with the sanctions bill that you all are working on, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=427.44s)]
*  you have a veto-proof majority. You just need the Senate leader to put it to a floor, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=432.24s)]
*  and you need the president to tell him, go. What are you waiting for? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=437.2s)]
*  I think the president should call on the Senate to vote approval of the Russian sanctions bill, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=442.56s)]
*  literally tomorrow. He's on his way tonight to the G7 meeting. He will be sitting across from [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=451.04s)]
*  world leaders. Right now, very bluntly, the perception may be one of weakness in terms of [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=459.44s)]
*  America's position on Ukraine. He can be there in a position of strength. This bill will pass [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=466.32s)]
*  over when we has 84 evenly divided co-sponsors. It will get 90 votes on the floor of the Senate. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=470.96s)]
*  This moment cries out for presidential leadership. There is an urgency here. We've seen [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=479.84s)]
*  the neighborhoods decimated. People killed in their sleep. Women and children shot in the back [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=484.08s)]
*  of their heads and buried in mass graves in Bukha. Children who are kidnapped and reeducated, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  20,000 of them behind Russian lines. These atrocities are ongoing, and the people of [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=496.56s)]
*  Ukraine are bleeding and dying. So I am hoping that the president will affirmatively show [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=503.36s)]
*  leadership here and call on the Senate to vote. The majority leader could do it tomorrow. We have [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=510.56s)]
*  some technical issues to work out, but I really think the moment has come for President Trump [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=517.76s)]
*  to call on the Senate. But Senator Graham, President Trump tweeted yesterday that he did [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=524.0s)]
*  speak to Vladimir Putin, who called very nicely to wish me a happy birthday and talk about Iran. He [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=527.76s)]
*  said they're going to speak again this week. President Trump has put sanctions on Iran while [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=533.68s)]
*  talking to Iran. Why won't he put sanctions on Russia while talking to Russia? We have sanctions [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=538.32s)]
*  on Russia. Not new Trump sanctions. You know that. So I find it odd. So my Democratic friends are [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=543.2800000000001s)]
*  holding him back when it comes to Iran. We really appreciate you trying to do diplomacy. What am I [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  saying? Do diplomacy with Iran until it doesn't work. What am I saying with Russia? I don't mind [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=556.32s)]
*  you. I don't care if you go on vacation with Putin. I don't care how it ends. I want the war [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=562.1600000000001s)]
*  to end so we don't start new wars. I want Ukraine surviving when the war ends. I want Putin not to [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=566.8s)]
*  be overly rewarded for the invasion. To China, if you stop buying Russian oil cheap, and India, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=573.1999999999999s)]
*  the war machine would grind to halt. President Trump has tried diplomacy. And I will say this. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=580.9599999999999s)]
*  I talked to him last night. You've made very sincere efforts to get Putin to the table. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=586.64s)]
*  I think he's playing a game with you and the entire world. It is now time to change the game [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=593.1999999999999s)]
*  with Putin. I talked to President Trump last night. Stay tuned. If we do not have a breakthrough soon, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=599.12s)]
*  I would expect that these sanctions will move through the Senate and the House and to China. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=604.9599999999999s)]
*  If you want your economy ruined, keep buying Russian cheap oil. If you want to be a new nation [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=610.0s)]
*  in the eyes of the civilized world, change your behavior regarding Putin and the Ayatollah. Until [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=615.92s)]
*  you change your behavior, you're going to be seen as a problem, not a solution. So these sanctions [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=621.92s)]
*  are coming if Putin doesn't change. And to my good friend Dick, you've been a great ally. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=627.8399999999999s)]
*  If we can't get the Ayatollah back to the table, it is now time to end his nuclear program using [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=633.76s)]
*  military force jointly with Israel if we have to. If we get Iran wrong, good luck with Russia. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=640.4s)]
*  Senator Blumenthal, the bill that you put forward will put a 500 percent tariff, as I understand it, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=647.76s)]
*  on imported goods from countries that buy Russia's oil, their uranium, their gas, other products. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=653.0400000000001s)]
*  It had hit China. It had hit India. The U.S. is also trying to negotiate trade deals with them. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=658.4000000000001s)]
*  Is that getting in the way? I think there is really no obstacle to our moving ahead with these [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=663.0400000000001s)]
*  bone-crushing sanctions. Even if oil prices spike because of what's happening in the Middle East? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=672.1600000000001s)]
*  We are now energy independent when it comes to oil, the United States. Europe has weaned itself [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=677.44s)]
*  off Russian oil. We visited with President Macron. We've talked to Chancellor Mertz. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=683.76s)]
*  Europe is solidly behind these sanctions. And we've incorporated flexibility in this bill [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=691.36s)]
*  based on our national security for a potential waiver where our interests are concerned, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=699.6s)]
*  unforeseeably or unknowably right now. We've incorporated exemptions for our European allies [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=705.68s)]
*  who are aiding Ukraine in the billions of dollars, giving them a little bit more time to adjust. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=712.3199999999999s)]
*  This is a carefully constructed bill. They get 20 percent of their gas from Russia. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=718.7199999999999s)]
*  What he says is there are three categories. If you're not doing business with Russia, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=722.64s)]
*  you don't have anything to worry about. If you're doing business with Russia but you're [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=726.64s)]
*  helping Ukraine, you have a carve-out for 270 days. If you're doing business with Russia and [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=730.16s)]
*  not helping Ukraine, you're screwed. The president can waive part of all of this based on our national [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=735.2s)]
*  interests. But to the people who wonder, should we pay a price for our freedom we have in the past, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=741.5200000000001s)]
*  go to Arlington. Oil prices will go up if we confront Russia through our bill. Oil prices [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=746.32s)]
*  will go up if we try to confront Iran for their nuclear ambitions. But you pay now or you pay [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=752.5600000000001s)]
*  later. If we get Iran right and we get peace with Russia, Ukraine, not only do oil prices come down, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=758.4000000000001s)]
*  the world will be better off. So this idea of having freedom and not sacrificing never existed, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=765.0400000000001s)]
*  nor does it exist now. Senator, I want to ask you as well about what's happening here at home [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=771.0400000000001s)]
*  with the protests we have seen around the country and some of them at times turning violent. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=777.52s)]
*  There has been criticism of Democrats' policies on immigration. Do you think that this confrontation [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=783.44s)]
*  that we are seeing now between military forces, federalized and protesters is partly because [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=790.32s)]
*  of what Democrats have done to date? The use of military, whether it's the National Guard [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=799.6800000000001s)]
*  or the Marines, can be inflammatory and provocative. We had protests across the country yesterday [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=806.4000000000001s)]
*  that were entirely peaceful. I was at a number of them in Connecticut, in Hartford, in Farmington, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=814.72s)]
*  and elsewhere all around the country. I think this country knows how to do peaceful protests. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=821.4399999999999s)]
*  And the exceptions ought to be handled by the local police and prosecutors locally. I spent most [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=830.72s)]
*  of my life in law enforcement before I had this job. I was the chief federal prosecutor in [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=837.92s)]
*  Connecticut, then I was attorney general for 20 years. And the reliance on state and local police, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=841.92s)]
*  I think, is well founded. And I've supported, in fact, I've introduced a bill that would limit [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=849.4399999999999s)]
*  use of the Insurrection Act, would define better what is a rebellion and compel the president to [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=856.24s)]
*  come back to Congress for approval if he uses this kind of federal force. So I think that [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=863.12s)]
*  there are criticisms to be made of immigration policies. In fact, I favor comprehensive [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=871.4399999999999s)]
*  immigration reform. We need it. But you would call a local law enforcement to perhaps stand up more [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=875.92s)]
*  and deal with it at the local level? It's the local level where law enforcement happens in this [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=883.5999999999999s)]
*  country. We rely on state and local police. And that ought to be the way we enforce our laws in [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=890.16s)]
*  this country and emphasize the importance of peaceful protests, such as we saw yesterday [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=897.12s)]
*  around the country. All right. Senators, thank you for joining us for a bipartisan interview. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=903.6s)]
*  Rare, as we said. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrAU-gMdkEU&t=908.64s)]
