# Hamas releases U.S.-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og)
*  This is a CBS News special report on John Dickerson in New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=0.0s)]
*  The last living American hostage held by Hamas has been released and is now headed back to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=5.0s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=10.6s)]
*  Israeli-American Edan Alexander was freed after a deal between Hamas and the United [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=11.6s)]
*  States. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=16.64s)]
*  Alexander had been held in Gaza since the October 7th attack in 2023. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=17.64s)]
*  That's 584 days and people have gathered in Edan's hometown of Teneflay, New Jersey. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=23.48s)]
*  Foreign correspondent MTS Tayyab has been following the release today. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=31.32s)]
*  MTS? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=35.24s)]
*  John, we have a very dynamic situation unfolding. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=36.24s)]
*  As you say, Edan Alexander has been released from Hamas custody. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=39.56s)]
*  He was handed over to the Red Cross and we believe he is on his way into Israel or is [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=44.06s)]
*  potentially already in Israel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=50.08s)]
*  As we've been saying, this caps off a 17-month ordeal, which began on October 7th when Hamas [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=52.699999999999996s)]
*  carried out that devastating assault across southern Israel in which 1,200 people were [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=58.58s)]
*  killed, 250 people were taken hostage, including the 21-year-old who was born in New Jersey [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=63.81999999999999s)]
*  and was serving with the Israeli military. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=70.97999999999999s)]
*  And then he was, of course, as we've been saying, taken into Gaza, where over the last [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=73.78s)]
*  We have seen two videos of him, propaganda videos, for lack of a better phrase, in which [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=79.98s)]
*  he appeared to be in reasonable health. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=86.42s)]
*  But as we know, his mother and family have been carrying out this extraordinary campaign [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=89.82000000000001s)]
*  to try to release their son and the remaining hostages in Gaza. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=95.22s)]
*  And one would imagine very soon now he will be in the arms of his family. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=99.58000000000001s)]
*  John? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=103.86s)]
*  Extraordinary. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=104.94s)]
*  MT, has any other news on how this came about? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=105.94s)]
*  U.S. officials were obviously involved. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=109.7s)]
*  Any other reporting on how this happened? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=112.14s)]
*  Yeah, so let me just read to you a post on True Social, President Trump's social media [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=115.22s)]
*  website, where he said, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=121.78s)]
*  Now, we understand that this was the result of direct four-way talks, which led to the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=135.86s)]
*  release, again, with countries like the U.S., Qatar, Egypt and Hamas. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=141.54000000000002s)]
*  Now, we do understand that the U.S. has previously held similar talks with Hamas, but this is [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=146.58s)]
*  a very significant one. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=151.34s)]
*  It's being described by Hamas as a goodwill gesture. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=153.06s)]
*  As we know, President Trump will be traveling to the Middle East. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=157.10000000000002s)]
*  He will be visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, but interestingly, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=160.22s)]
*  he will not be visiting Israel. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=165.85999999999999s)]
*  Whatever the case, we have heard from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=168.06s)]
*  over the past several hours, where he said that this attempt to essentially put a pause [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=172.22s)]
*  to the fighting or look for some sort of meaningful ceasefire is not something they will be pursuing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=179.62s)]
*  He said that Israel is continuing to commit what he describes as all war objectives, and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=185.5s)]
*  that will be under fire. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  So for the crisis that we've been seeing in Gaza, which, of course, has inflicted so [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=194.38000000000002s)]
*  much damage across the Palestinian territory and the loss of so much life, at least according [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=198.98000000000002s)]
*  to the Israelis, that continues. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=204.14000000000001s)]
*  But there is some hopeful signs that these negotiations will continue. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=206.26000000000002s)]
*  We also understand that Prime Minister Netanyahu has asked for a delegation to be sent to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=209.54000000000002s)]
*  one of the mediating countries in order for those talks to carry on. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=215.22s)]
*  But John, as we've been saying, you can see those images now of supporters of Edan's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=219.46s)]
*  family with those Israeli flags, many of them breathing a sigh of relief, but very sad for [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=224.86s)]
*  the dozens of hostages who still remain in Gaza. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=229.94s)]
*  MTS Time in London reporting on the release of Edan Alexander, a 21-year-old, the last [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=233.14000000000001s)]
*  known living U.S. hostage. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=239.86s)]
*  Our coverage will continue on CBS News 24-7, your local news and tonight on the CBS Evening [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLsUGYT0Og&t=242.45999999999998s)]
