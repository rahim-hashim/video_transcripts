# UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell says Gaza is a "hellscape for children"
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY)
*  The Israeli death toll civilian and military stands at nearly 1,700 in the last year, according [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=0.0s)]
*  to the U.S.-funded National Defense University. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=4.92s)]
*  The impact of the war will be felt for generations, which is why we want to take a closer look [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=8.16s)]
*  at children in conflict. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=12.64s)]
*  In Gaza, at least 14,000 kids have died, another 12,500 injured, according to the UN. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=14.5s)]
*  Catherine Russell is the executive director of UNICEF, the UN agency that helps disadvantaged [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  children around the world. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=26.84s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=29.139999999999997s)]
*  I know you're deeply concerned, you've said, by what is happening right now in Lebanon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=31.02s)]
*  Thousands of children on the streets or in shelters because they've had to flee without [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=36.9s)]
*  supplies. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=40.66s)]
*  What does the speed of this escalation do to your ability to help these kids? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=42.86s)]
*  Well, I think the speed and intensity is shocking, honestly, and it does make it challenging [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=47.5s)]
*  for us. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=52.7s)]
*  However, we have been in Lebanon, we're on the ground there, we are doing a lot of work [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=53.7s)]
*  moving in tons of supplies, medical supplies and other supplies. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=57.94s)]
*  But I think the challenge is that the population, about a million people, have been displaced. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=61.54s)]
*  And so that kind of movement makes it very challenging to try to provide the services [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=67.58s)]
*  that people need. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=71.78s)]
*  But I think we're there, we're doing it, obviously we need more resources, it's always [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=73.25999999999999s)]
*  a challenge. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=76.7s)]
*  But I think I feel confident at this point that we can meet the needs, but it's taking [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=77.7s)]
*  a tremendous amount of effort on our part to do it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=82.66s)]
*  The UN refugee chief, one of your colleagues, said today that the strikes on Lebanon had [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=86.06s)]
*  violated international humanitarian law. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=90.58s)]
*  Is that affecting your workers? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=94.97999999999999s)]
*  I would say for humanitarian workers, the last year has been so challenging. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=98.3s)]
*  We have lost a record number of humanitarian workers around the world. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=103.5s)]
*  There are so many conflicts going on in so many places where they're so vulnerable. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=106.38s)]
*  And of course, as the head of this, my operation, I worry constantly about our teams there and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=110.78s)]
*  our staff there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=116.22s)]
*  And I think UNHCR, who you're referring to, they did lose two staff people in Lebanon. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=117.22s)]
*  And that's a crushing thing to happen because these people are so amazing and they risk [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=122.22s)]
*  their lives every day to try to help children and desperate people. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=127.02s)]
*  And to see that happen is really crushing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=130.85999999999999s)]
*  UNHRA told CBS that they are heading down the track to, quote, a man-made disaster [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=134.29999999999998s)]
*  again in Gaza. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=140.01999999999998s)]
*  I was told the food deliveries have been continuously declining since May. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=141.94s)]
*  There are law and order challenges. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=146.89999999999998s)]
*  That's part of the problem. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  One million people didn't get food in August. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=150.17999999999998s)]
*  That number now is 1.4 million. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=152.89999999999998s)]
*  How bad is the malnutrition and the hygiene and the mental health of kids there? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=156.26s)]
*  It's all terrible. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=161.78s)]
*  I think if you look at Gaza, really through the eyes of a child, it's a hellscape for [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=162.82s)]
*  children. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=167.7s)]
*  They've been moved multiple times. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=168.7s)]
*  They know people. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=170.34s)]
*  They're family members who've been killed. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=171.34s)]
*  They've been injured. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=173.14s)]
*  They don't have enough food to eat. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=174.7s)]
*  They don't have enough water. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=176.22s)]
*  They don't have clean water. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=177.5s)]
*  I think these children, you know, you mentioned it earlier, they're so traumatized by what's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=179.06s)]
*  happening. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=183.14s)]
*  And I think the notion that we can, even if we can get more supplies in there, the trauma [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=184.14s)]
*  that these children are suffering is going to have lifetime and even postgenerational [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=188.98s)]
*  challenges for them because it's just so profound and it's been almost a year of this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=194.57999999999998s)]
*  They really, it's hard to imagine what that's like for a child. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=198.89999999999998s)]
*  You know, you can't really imagine anything comparable for them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=201.94s)]
*  And I think they have no security. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=206.54s)]
*  They have no certainty in life. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=208.5s)]
*  They're just really suffering every single day. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=210.26s)]
*  But you were able to get polio shots into kids. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=213.14s)]
*  How come you can't get them food? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=216.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's such a good question. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=218.1s)]
*  I mean, first, I would say it's terrible that we had to go in and do polio vaccinations, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=219.42s)]
*  right? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=224.74s)]
*  There hadn't been polio in Gaza for years, decades, really. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=225.74s)]
*  And of course, we started to see some cases of it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=229.3s)]
*  That's because they're living in such terrible conditions. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=231.62s)]
*  The water is dirty and all the rest of it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=234.22s)]
*  So we were able, with other UN agencies, to go in and vaccinate children for polio. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  Vaccinated well over half a million children. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=241.34s)]
*  I mean, 500 million children. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=243.57999999999998s)]
*  It was a real success story. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=245.74s)]
*  And I think the important point about that is it shows that if the authorities there [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=247.06s)]
*  help us make it possible for us to do our work, we can do it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=252.42000000000002s)]
*  We can definitely do it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=256.26s)]
*  But we need more support so that there's security. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=257.5s)]
*  As you say, there is not security right now. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=260.66s)]
*  It's very dangerous to move things around. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=262.54s)]
*  The roads are a mess. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=264.78000000000003s)]
*  We get stuck at checkpoints. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=265.86s)]
*  I mean, it's just one logistical problem after another. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=266.86s)]
*  And I think the polio lesson is we can do it and they can help us do it if they choose [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=270.52s)]
*  to. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=275.14s)]
*  Coordinated international pressure to allow for it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=278.97999999999996s)]
*  Moving away from the Middle East and to Africa, I know Sudan is an issue you have been trying [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=280.86s)]
*  to put on the world's radar for some time. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=286.62s)]
*  Nearly four million children under five are acutely malnourished and there's a cholera [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=289.34s)]
*  outbreak. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=294.06s)]
*  Can you break through there, another war zone? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=295.14s)]
*  Sudan is the most alarming place for me at the moment because of the scale of it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=298.62s)]
*  It is the largest displacement crisis in the world and the largest hunger problem in the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=305.46s)]
*  world. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=309.94s)]
*  We have already declared that there is famine in part of Sudan. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=310.94s)]
*  Children are grossly malnourished and children are on the verge of famine in many places [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=314.9s)]
*  where it hasn't already been declared. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=319.5s)]
*  There's also incredible violence. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=321.65999999999997s)]
*  Children are moving constantly. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=324.09999999999997s)]
*  They're very vulnerable. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=325.53999999999996s)]
*  I was there several months ago and the stories I heard were heartbreaking of what children [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=326.94s)]
*  had seen and experienced of this. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=331.54s)]
*  Nineteen million children who live in Sudan, 17 million have been out of school for over [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=334.18s)]
*  a year. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=338.5s)]
*  Seventeen out of 19 million children are out of school. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=339.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=341.94s)]
*  For over a year. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=342.94s)]
*  What kind of life is this? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=343.94s)]
*  They can't get medical supplies. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=344.94s)]
*  It's really challenging for them. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=346.42s)]
*  But I will say this. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=348.22s)]
*  I met with some children in a camp that UNICEF supports and the amazing thing was they could [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=349.58000000000004s)]
*  still talk to me about the future, their hope for the future, which I, you know, I'm always [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=355.46000000000004s)]
*  struck by this that children are children everywhere and even in the most desperate [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=359.86s)]
*  places they can have hope. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=363.34s)]
*  But the international community has got to do better and in Sudan, everyone has got to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=365.06s)]
*  put pressure on the parties to stop the fighting and to stop making lives so miserable for [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=370.14s)]
*  children. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=376.65999999999997s)]
*  Catherine Russell, thank you. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=377.65999999999997s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKoyF-f0wHY&t=379.65999999999997s)]
