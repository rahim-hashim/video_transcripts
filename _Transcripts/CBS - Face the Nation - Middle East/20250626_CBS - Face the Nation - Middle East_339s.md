# New details revealed about U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear targets
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q)
*  The Trump administration is continuing to defend its strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Sources are telling CBS News a U.S. intelligence assessment of those strikes [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=5.04s)]
*  found they set back Iran's nuclear program by only a matter of months. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Secretary of Defense Pete Hexf forcefully pushed back against those claims. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=13.76s)]
*  That was at the Pentagon this morning and he said other intelligence reports backed up [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=17.52s)]
*  President Trump's statements that the sites were obliterated. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=21.28s)]
*  President Trump directed the most complex and secretive military operation in history [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=25.52s)]
*  and it was a resounding success resulting in a ceasefire agreement and the end of the 12-day [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=31.84s)]
*  war. Whether it's Director Radcliffe or Odi and I gathered, I read the statements at the beginning, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  they're the ones aggregating the intelligence and they're saying nuclear facilities were [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=43.6s)]
*  destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over a number of years. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=48.32s)]
*  And CBS News White House reporter Olivia Rinaldi joins us now with more on this. Olivia, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=52.0s)]
*  very good to see you. It was certainly a passionate press conference. Did we learn anything new about [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=56.24s)]
*  Operation Midnight Hammer and how this all unfolded? Well Nancy, it was actually fascinating in the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=60.56s)]
*  briefing despite the contention that we heard from the Secretary of Defense. We heard a lot from [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=66.4s)]
*  the Joint Chiefs of Staff leader General Cain and he essentially laid out how we got to this point, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=71.36s)]
*  which was that there's a group that does defensive threat assessments for the United States [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=77.36s)]
*  and 15 years ago they noticed that this facility, which they thought was [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=82.64s)]
*  Iran enriching uranium, was starting to be built underground. So they started the assessment of how [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=89.04s)]
*  they would conduct these attacks 15 years ago and it's been the same two people working on that job [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=94.56s)]
*  since then. Because of that they were able to notice that the facility was being built underground, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=100.88s)]
*  there were ventilator systems, there were entry points and exits, and that is how they essentially [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=106.16s)]
*  became able to make this bunker buster bomb. Because we had no weapons at the time that could [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=112.0s)]
*  penetrate that deep, about 300 feet deep into the side of a mountain, to destroy this site if they [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=118.08s)]
*  would eventually need to. Which, you know, last Saturday they made that call that this is something [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=124.72s)]
*  that they need to do. So because of that we learned a lot of details about this operation. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=129.84s)]
*  We know it's about 36 hours in the skies for those B-2 bombers and they dropped about 14, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=136.32s)]
*  30,000 pound bombs on various sites, three different sites in Iran. So a lot of details [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=142.48s)]
*  we learned there among the contention we heard from the Secretary of Defense. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=149.04s)]
*  And Olivia, we're also getting a look at the path forward from here at the White House today. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=152.88s)]
*  Press Secretary Caroline Levitt spoke about potential diplomacy with Iran. I want to ask [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=156.32s)]
*  you about that, but first let's take a listen. I can assure all of you we continue to be in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  close communication with the Iranians and through our intermediaries as well, namely the Qataris, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  who have been an incredible ally and partner throughout this entire effort. And as I said, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  this administration is always focused on diplomacy and peace. So Olivia, what do we know about the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=176.48s)]
*  sent of these talks between the administration and Iran? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, the president yesterday during that press conference at NATO said that there will be talks [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=184.96s)]
*  next week between the U.S. and Iran. This would be the first round of diplomacy that would happen [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=189.52s)]
*  since those strikes occurred last Saturday. So Caroline was asked in the briefing today [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=194.4s)]
*  if there is a meeting scheduled. She said at the moment there is no meeting scheduled between the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=199.36s)]
*  U.S. and Iran, but you heard her there say that there are still conversations happening between [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  the two governments, whether that's between intermediaries or others that are helping in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=209.52s)]
*  those conversations. And we know that Special Envoy Steve Wyckoff has met with the Iranians [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  at least five times in the last several weeks as we've been kind of getting to this point where [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  the strikes ended up happening. So as a result, we know that they are trying to work on diplomacy, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=225.12s)]
*  but there's no official meeting scheduled yet. And that is essentially where we're at for steps [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=230.88s)]
*  forward in the fallout from everything that has occurred within the last week, Nancy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=236.08s)]
*  And a lot has happened in the last week, Olivia. We also understand top national security officials [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=241.36s)]
*  are meeting with senators for a classified briefing on those strikes. What do we know about that? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=245.36s)]
*  Yeah, this was that briefing that was rescheduled from earlier in the week. We know the senators [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=250.96s)]
*  will be getting a briefing today that will include Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth talking about [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=255.28s)]
*  these strikes, their efficacy, and what this looks like for Iran's nuclear program. And I [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=260.24s)]
*  suspect a question that will be asked specifically by Democrats is why now, why did this need to be [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=265.36s)]
*  done now? What was the intelligence you saw at that moment that would require this to be done [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=270.56s)]
*  last Saturday, these strikes? Olivia, we always appreciate your time. Thank you very much. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=275.68s)]
*  Thank you. Earlier, we spoke with retired Marine Colonel Mark Kansian about that Pentagon press [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=280.24s)]
*  briefing, and he believes the weapons, quote, struck where they're supposed to strike and set [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=285.68s)]
*  back Iran's nuclear program, possibly pressuring the country to make a deal. But he also says the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=290.32s)]
*  new insight offer does not imply the full scale attack being touted by the Trump administration. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=295.68s)]
*  Political side, they are clearly using, you know, exaggerated and expressive language. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=301.92s)]
*  It's important to keep an eye on what the intelligence community and what the military [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=309.36s)]
*  is saying, because they are not willing to do that. In fact, General Cain was asked whether he was [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=314.4s)]
*  being pressured to change his views. And he said no, he was expressing his personal views. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=320.4s)]
*  In the meantime, Iranian lawmakers are moving forward with a bill to suspend the country's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog following these strikes on its nuclear sites. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=330.8s)]
*  The bill is now headed to the president for final approval. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOO-Ml5tL3Q&t=335.92s)]
