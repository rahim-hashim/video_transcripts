# Trump demands Iranian surrender as he considers U.S. engagement
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU)
*  Hello, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump is demanding an unconditional surrender from Iran, five days into the country's [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=2.72s)]
*  deadly conflict with Israel. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=7.86s)]
*  The president met with his national security team in the White House Situation Room earlier [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=10.06s)]
*  today as tensions escalate in the Middle East. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=14.72s)]
*  CBS News has learned President Trump is considering joining Israel in targeting Iranian nuclear [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=18.28s)]
*  sites. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=24.32s)]
*  Last week, Israel kicked off what it described as a multi-day operation with the goal of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=25.46s)]
*  destroying Iran's nuclear program. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=30.66s)]
*  The strikes have focused on Iranian nuclear sites and the capital city of Tehran. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=33.3s)]
*  Iran has responded by firing dozens of missiles toward Israeli territory, including the areas [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=38.34s)]
*  surrounding Israel's second-largest city, Tel Aviv. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=44.42s)]
*  In a series of posts on Truth Social Today, President Trump said, quote, we now have complete [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  and total control of the skies over Iran. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=53.34s)]
*  He later said in a separate post, quote, we know exactly where the so-called supreme leader [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=56.580000000000005s)]
*  is hiding, referring to the head of Iran. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=61.46000000000001s)]
*  The president goes on to say, quote, we are not going to take him out, at least not for [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=64.46000000000001s)]
*  now, but we don't want missiles shot at civilians or American soldiers. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=69.34s)]
*  Our patience is wearing thin. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=74.18s)]
*  CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams is on the ground in northern Iraq [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=76.62s)]
*  where some Iranians are fleeing their home country. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=81.66s)]
*  Holly? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=84.46s)]
*  Like other international journalists, we cannot get into Iran at the moment to report on the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=85.46s)]
*  conflict from the ground there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=91.42s)]
*  But here in Iraq, we've traveled to Iran's border where we've seen Iranians crossing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=93.34s)]
*  that frontier, some saying that they are fleeing Israeli airstrikes. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=98.12s)]
*  Now most of those Iranians did not want to speak to us on camera because they're worried [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=102.42s)]
*  about punishment from Iran's government when they go home. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=106.38s)]
*  What they told us off camera was fascinating. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=110.22s)]
*  They said that they were frightened, that they've never seen anything like this conflict [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=112.76s)]
*  and that many Iranians are stockpiling food and fuel. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=116.54s)]
*  There are also reports from inside Iran that many people are fleeing their homes and leaving [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=120.18s)]
*  the capital Tehran for their own safety. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=124.64s)]
*  Some of those Iranians we spoke to at the border told us they believe that the regime [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=127.7s)]
*  itself is frightened. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=131.7s)]
*  And one man even said he thought this conflict may bring down Iran's government. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=133.62s)]
*  Now that is extremely interesting because when Israel first launched its attack on Iran, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=138.7s)]
*  the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu essentially called on Iranians to rise up [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=143.89999999999998s)]
*  against their own government. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=148.94s)]
*  It's true that many Iranians hate the regime when mass protests have erupted, the Iranian [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=150.98s)]
*  regime has responded with deadly force. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=156.1s)]
*  Despite that, with their country now under bombardment, most of the Iranians we spoke [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=159.01999999999998s)]
*  to at the border seemed more focused on survival than revolution. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=163.7s)]
*  Holly Williams, CBS News, our bill in Northern Iraq. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=168.42s)]
*  CBS News national security coordinating producer James Laporta joins us now. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=173.57999999999998s)]
*  James, great to have you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=177.77999999999997s)]
*  What else have you learned about the Situation Room meeting and what the president is considering [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=179.82s)]
*  in regards to Iran? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  So, yes, today there was a meeting at the White House within the Situation Room where [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  considering his options over whether or not to join the Israelis in a potential strike [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=194.34s)]
*  on Iran. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=200.34s)]
*  Amongst those options is whether or not we would potentially send in our B-2 bombers [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=202.46s)]
*  to join Israel. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=208.78s)]
*  Israel has long wanted to strike at Iran's nuclear facilities, but they don't necessarily [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=211.5s)]
*  have the logistical means to do so or the capabilities to do so. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=218.5s)]
*  So the big question for President Trump today is whether or not to join the Israelis in [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=222.3s)]
*  that effort. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=227.18s)]
*  James, what military assets has the U.S. sent to the region that could play a role in any [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=228.82000000000002s)]
*  potential action? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=234.94s)]
*  So sure, in the past 48 hours or so we've seen multiple air refueling tankers sent to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=238.34s)]
*  the region, more than two dozen actually. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=244.3s)]
*  These are aircraft that can refuel fighter squadrons or B-2 bombers while they're in [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=248.58s)]
*  the air. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=253.94000000000003s)]
*  There is the Nimitz carrier group in the region with its guided missile cruisers and destroyers [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=257.1s)]
*  that are in the region. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=262.26s)]
*  Today we learned from the Defense Department that fighter squadrons in the region, so F-16s, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=264.42s)]
*  F-22s, F-35s, their deployment has been extended in the region. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=270.78s)]
*  So there's multiple assets there that, now the Defense Department will say that these [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=277.61999999999995s)]
*  are there for defense of American assets and interests. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=282.29999999999995s)]
*  However, these same assets can quickly become offensive. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=288.38s)]
*  All right, James, supported with the very latest on that Situation Room meeting today. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=291.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=296.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=297.34s)]
*  CBS News congressional correspondent Nicole Killian joins us now from Capitol Hill. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=298.82s)]
*  Nicole, some congressional lawmakers have introduced a bill to keep President Trump [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=303.41999999999996s)]
*  from attacking Iran without congressional approval. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=308.41999999999996s)]
*  What more can you tell us? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=312.02s)]
*  Yeah, well just to be clear, this is a resolution, not a bill, and there are actually several [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=313.41999999999996s)]
*  resolutions that have been proposed. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=317.53999999999996s)]
*  But one that is getting attention is that of Kentucky Congressman Tom Massey, which [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=319.34s)]
*  was co-sponsored with California Congressman Ro Khanna. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=323.38s)]
*  And that, as you mentioned, would prohibit the U.S. from being involved in any type of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=326.26000000000005s)]
*  conflict between Israel and Iran. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=330.86s)]
*  But there are also, as I mentioned, other resolutions as well with respect to war powers. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=334.46000000000004s)]
*  For instance, here in the Senate, Senator Tim Kaine also introduced a resolution this [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=341.42s)]
*  week that basically would require a debate and a vote in Congress before the U.S. were [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=346.54s)]
*  to take any potential action. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=351.70000000000005s)]
*  You also have Senator Bernie Sanders, who introduced the No War Against Iran Act to [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=354.0s)]
*  prohibit any U.S. federal funding from being used in any kind of military force, potentially [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=358.64000000000004s)]
*  if there was some involvement with respect to Iran. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=368.16s)]
*  So there are lots of measures floating around, most of them symbolic in nature, but nonetheless [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=370.64s)]
*  a sign that some in Congress don't want to see the U.S. dragged into a larger conflict here. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=376.88s)]
*  Nicole, on the flip side, what are some of President Trump's allies in Congress saying [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=382.8s)]
*  about the conflict? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=387.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, just to be clear, I mean, we did see today here on Capitol Hill Vice President [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=389.36s)]
*  J.D. Vance. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  He met with Senate Republicans for their lunch today where this issue of the conflict [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=394.88s)]
*  between Israel and Iran did come up. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, the Vice President tried to make clear that certainly the President remains [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=402.96s)]
*  concerned about the potential for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon and is concerned [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=407.6s)]
*  about Iran having enriched uranium. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=413.12s)]
*  So the President certainly wants to take precautions and make sure that that is a situation [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=415.36s)]
*  that doesn't grow, if you will. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=421.52000000000004s)]
*  We also saw the Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard here on Capitol Hill as well [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=424.56s)]
*  for a closed-door hearing with lawmakers. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=429.68s)]
*  This was more related to the budget, but certainly this issue did come up as well. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=432.8s)]
*  But before entering that briefing, Gabbard did say that her position is consistent with [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=436.64s)]
*  that of the president and that she did testify earlier this year saying that the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=442.4s)]
*  Intelligence Committee didn't — or the intelligence community, rather, didn't have [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=447.44s)]
*  enough information as of yet about Iran creating a nuclear weapon or didn't believe that Iran [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=452.47999999999996s)]
*  was creating a nuclear weapon. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=457.68s)]
*  So she continued to stand by that testimony and insisted that it is no different than [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=459.91999999999996s)]
*  what the president is currently saying in his current posture. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=464.24s)]
*  All right, Nicole Kellyanne, it's always great to see you. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxAGYtmpOU&t=469.76s)]
