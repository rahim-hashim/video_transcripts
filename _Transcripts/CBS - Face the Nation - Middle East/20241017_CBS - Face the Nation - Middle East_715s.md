# Yahya Sinwar, Hamas leader and top target after Oct. 7 attacks, killed in Gaza, Israel says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM)
*  This is a CBS News special report on Major Garrett in Washington. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=0.0s)]
*  We come on the air with breaking news from the Middle East. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=5.34s)]
*  The Israeli foreign minister says the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, has been killed. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=7.92s)]
*  Sinwar was one of three people killed during an Israeli military operation in southern [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=14.4s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=18.76s)]
*  Israeli officials examined dental images and DNA evidence to confirm Sinwar's identity [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=19.76s)]
*  and therefore his death. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=25.580000000000002s)]
*  Sinwar led Hamas since the summer and has been one of the key figures within the terror [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  organization's political and military clashes over the years with Israel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=33.12s)]
*  He is also significantly the alleged mastermind behind the October 7, 2023 attack in Israel, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=37.84s)]
*  which killed roughly 1,200 people. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=44.96s)]
*  Since then, Israel has engaged in a devastating ground military operation in Gaza to destroy [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=48.32s)]
*  Hamas and one of its other missions to quote, find and kill Sinwar. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=54.72s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Innocencio joins us from Tel Aviv. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  Remy, this has been talked about on social media for the better part of two hours. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=64.36s)]
*  We now, through the foreign minister, have what constitutes confirmation. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=69.7s)]
*  What else can you tell us? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=73.26s)]
*  Yes, that's right, Major. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  The foreign minister, Israel Katz, saying that this is a great military and moral achievement [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  and that they're also pushing back that this is everything that they wanted against the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=83.08s)]
*  evil axis led by Iran. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=86.6s)]
*  Images of Sinwar first started circulating around 3 p.m. local time here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=89.56s)]
*  It's now been about five hours or so since then. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=94.0s)]
*  Images of what appeared then to be a dead man curled up in a pile of rubble and with [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=96.88s)]
*  a deep gash across the top of his head. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=101.56s)]
*  The IDF then released a statement about an hour later saying that during operations in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=104.92s)]
*  the Gaza Strip, they killed three terrorists and then they started checking the possibility [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=109.48s)]
*  that one of them was, in fact, Yahya Sinwar. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  Tests were run on his DNA, his fingerprints were checked because Israel has those records [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=117.84s)]
*  from the time Sinwar spent in prison. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=121.7s)]
*  And now, interestingly, local Israeli media are reporting that Sinwar's killing may actually [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=124.28s)]
*  have been by chance that Israeli troops were clearing the area, saw these three people, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=129.0s)]
*  fired on them, and only when they went to inspect their bodies did they think that they [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=136.0s)]
*  think that one of the men looked like Yahya Sinwar. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=139.48s)]
*  And now we get that confirmation that it was. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=143.04s)]
*  And Remy, in the main, Sinwar has been not that visible above ground in Gaza, as I understand [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=146.44s)]
*  it, and that has been one of the complicating factors for the Israeli Defense Forces as [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=153.6s)]
*  it has carried out its campaign in Gaza. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=158.68s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=160.52s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=162.52s)]
*  It has been very difficult to try to track down where he is, of course. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=165.12s)]
*  And we're also trying to hear what Hamas has been trying to have in a kind of a reaction. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=168.68s)]
*  Hamas so far hasn't issued a statement so far. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=174.68s)]
*  But looking ahead, the first question for that group is who will lead Hamas now? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=176.72s)]
*  Israel killed Hamas' commander, we know, Mohammed Deif, back in July. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=183.72s)]
*  He was called the Osama bin Laden of Gaza and another mastermind of the October 7 attacks. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  We know that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran in July, the head of Hamas' political [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=192.24s)]
*  wing. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=197.0s)]
*  And many of these have been killed, along with thousands of Hamas fighters. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=198.04s)]
*  So if and when a new leader is decided, Major, the question then could be whether to try [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=201.04s)]
*  to strike Israel here in retaliation. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=205.9s)]
*  We know Hamas has been degraded over the past year, but we know it hasn't been destroyed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=208.8s)]
*  Or perhaps could the death of Sinwar bring Hamas to its knees in some way and then back [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=213.32s)]
*  to the negotiating table for talks. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=217.72s)]
*  But right now, we might expect that Hamas in Gaza and as we know they exist across the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=219.56s)]
*  Middle East is reeling and is in disarray. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=223.12s)]
*  Remy, please stand by. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=225.96s)]
*  I want to bring in our Face the Nation moderator and our chief foreign affairs correspondent, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=227.4s)]
*  Margaret Brennan. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  Margaret, what are you hearing from your sources and can you, for the American audience, contextualize [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  the importance of this moment? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=236.88000000000002s)]
*  Major, U.S. sources, Israeli sources tell us this is a game changer. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=238.72000000000003s)]
*  We now have from Israel Defense Forces, from top Israeli officials, the confirmation that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=245.32000000000002s)]
*  Hamas commander Yahya Sinwar, he was the architect of the October 7th attack on Israel, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=252.64s)]
*  is confirmed dead. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=258.56s)]
*  So to give Americans a sense of how significant this is to the Israelis, this is their Osama [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=260.44s)]
*  bin Laden. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=265.76s)]
*  And on Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces killed Sinwar and two other men in a raid [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=267.4s)]
*  in southern Gaza. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=273.08s)]
*  An Israeli security official told CBS Today the soldiers happened to notice that one of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=274.4s)]
*  the men just looked like Sinwar. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=279.84s)]
*  In other words, they got lucky here. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=282.67999999999995s)]
*  And because this wasn't a combat engagement, not a bomb drop from the sky, a combat engagement, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=286.02s)]
*  they were able to take DNA samples from the remains back to Israel and to confirm the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=291.08s)]
*  death. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=296.96s)]
*  They now have multiple sources of confirmation in the field and back in Israel that the DNA [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=297.96s)]
*  matches that of Yahya Sinwar. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=302.59999999999997s)]
*  So from this morning, from dawn, I am told by U.S. officials, they have been working [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=305.12s)]
*  to try to make this determination. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=309.96s)]
*  We know President Biden is traveling outside of the country, but throughout the morning [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=313.35999999999996s)]
*  he has been regularly updated aboard Air Force One. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  And at this point, all my reporting is that there was no U.S. role in the specific attack [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=320.52s)]
*  that killed Sinwar Wednesday. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=326.64s)]
*  For more than a year now, U.S. intelligence and Joint Special Operations Command have [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=329.74s)]
*  been side by side, hand in glove with the Israelis, trying to help them through intelligence [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=336.14000000000004s)]
*  sharing hunt down the leaders of Hamas, including Yahya Sinwar. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=341.90000000000003s)]
*  The top echelon of leadership has now been killed. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=346.98s)]
*  Sinwar was the mastermind responsible for that surprise attack October 7th, an insurgent [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=350.74s)]
*  attack against one of the most sophisticated military forces in the world. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=356.02s)]
*  It killed 1,200 Israelis. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=360.18s)]
*  His stated intent was to help Palestinians to shake off through force Israeli rule, but [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=362.9s)]
*  his actions also led to a war between Hamas and Israel that has so far killed 42,000 of [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=368.62s)]
*  his fellow Palestinians, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, the majority of them [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=375.62s)]
*  major women and children. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=381.09999999999997s)]
*  So this death is potentially a game changer for the conflict, but there are a lot of unknowns. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=383.94s)]
*  Remy mentioned some of them. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=388.74s)]
*  What happens to the roughly 100 remaining hostages Hamas took last year, four of them [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=391.28s)]
*  U.S. citizens? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=396.58s)]
*  Another wild card. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=398.9s)]
*  Who steps in to take over Hamas? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=399.98s)]
*  Will they be more willing to negotiate a deal with Israel? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=401.9s)]
*  How does this play out, by the way, in Tehran? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=406.54s)]
*  Remember, this conflict has spread through the region over the past year, and we have [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=409.94s)]
*  been on standby waiting for an expected Israeli retaliatory attack on Iran because of other [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=414.78000000000003s)]
*  assassinations the Israelis carried out against Hezbollah leaders, another militia, that one [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=419.98s)]
*  based in Lebanon. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=426.18s)]
*  In Gaza, Sinwar, 62 years old, major, he spent nearly two decades in Israeli custody because [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=428.5s)]
*  of his role in murdering Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=435.62s)]
*  He was freed by then Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu back in 2011 from prison as part [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=438.58s)]
*  of a hostage deal. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=445.28s)]
*  There is some historic irony here that we will shortly hear from the Israeli prime minister [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=447.18s)]
*  once again, Benjamin Netanyahu, that Yahya Sinwar, the man responsible for killing the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=453.03999999999996s)]
*  most number of Jews since the Holocaust, during the reign of Prime Minister Netanyahu, is [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=459.65999999999997s)]
*  now confirmed to be dead at the hands of Israel Defense Forces. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=466.34s)]
*  Margaret, I want to talk to you about what we can see on screen now, which are protests [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=470.5s)]
*  for those supporting the return of the remaining hostages to Israel. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=474.73999999999995s)]
*  This is spontaneous reaction within Israel to the announced death of Yahya Sinwar. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=479.65999999999997s)]
*  And as you mentioned, 90 or so hostages believed to still be alive. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=486.05999999999995s)]
*  Do you believe and do you have any source information this hour that suggests the death [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=490.38s)]
*  of Sinwar might in any way, since he was the principal interlocutor with not only Israel, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=495.9s)]
*  but Egypt, the United States and others involved in these ongoing negotiations, that there [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=501.34s)]
*  might be a better prospect of winning the return of those hostages in the aftermath [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=505.3s)]
*  of his death? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=510.9s)]
*  Major, I put that question earlier today to a number of U.S. officials who say a lot depends [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=511.9s)]
*  on the choices being made in the coming days by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=518.8199999999999s)]
*  I spoke to some Israeli sources as well who do see this as a moment of potential opportunity. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=525.9399999999999s)]
*  The prime minister could look at this and say that Israel has taken out the top echelon [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=532.5s)]
*  of Hamas leadership. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=537.8199999999999s)]
*  They could use that to declare victory and to wind down the conflict in Gaza. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=539.66s)]
*  Do they do that in a way that unlocks a deal with Hamas for the release of hostages? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=543.98s)]
*  That's the broader question. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=550.3399999999999s)]
*  For the families of those like the protesters that you see out there in the street, their [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=552.1s)]
*  number one priority is bringing home those being held against their will who have been [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=555.78s)]
*  there for more than a year now. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=560.46s)]
*  Margaret Brennan, thank you very much. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=562.38s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News' senior national security correspondent, Charlie Daggett, who [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=563.62s)]
*  joins us from the Pentagon. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=567.06s)]
*  There have been enormous or certainly significant measurable deployments of U.S. military personnel [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=569.06s)]
*  in the last year after the October 7th attack. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=573.92s)]
*  Charlie, what are you hearing there at the Pentagon? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=576.78s)]
*  Yeah, well, Major, just like everybody else, we've been waiting all day. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=579.0600000000001s)]
*  We heard the news this morning. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=582.22s)]
*  We've been trying to scramble for confirmation this will potentially impact U.S. forces in [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=583.46s)]
*  the area. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=588.7s)]
*  There are 40,000 U.S. forces there. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=589.7s)]
*  There's a strike—carrier strike group in the region, several destroyers. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=591.78s)]
*  Development just this week, there's been a battery, a THAAD battery, a missile battery, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=598.66s)]
*  which is to help out Israeli air defenses. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=602.58s)]
*  That's the first time we've seen U.S. troops in a so-called combat role inside Israel [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=605.78s)]
*  itself manning that missile battery. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=610.26s)]
*  So the United States is already forward-postured and connected to this, because all roads lead [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=612.9s)]
*  back to Iran. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=618.98s)]
*  Overnight the defense secretary announced a strike against Houthi targets in Yemen. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=620.6600000000001s)]
*  That is fairly routine. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=625.9200000000001s)]
*  What isn't routine was the use of B-2 stealth bombers, long-range, able to carry heavy [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=629.46s)]
*  ordnance. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=635.38s)]
*  And in his words, it's a unique demonstration to target facilities that our adversaries [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=636.38s)]
*  want to keep underground, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened or fortified, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=641.78s)]
*  and hit five underground targets. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=645.98s)]
*  So that's not just a message to the Houthis saying, we can reach you, we've got the [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=647.74s)]
*  reach and we've got the weapons to do it, but also a side message to Iran. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=651.58s)]
*  So they are already forward-postured. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=656.12s)]
*  Certainly there will be a raise of the alert because of what has happened, this very significant [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=658.66s)]
*  killing of Sinwar and the repercussions that that's going to have. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=664.14s)]
*  But they were already ready. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=668.34s)]
*  Again, as Margaret had said, what we're waiting for here is Israel's retaliation for Iran's [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=669.66s)]
*  bombardment on October 1st. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=675.38s)]
*  That would come first, and then we wait to see what Iran does to reply. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=678.02s)]
*  The world awaits. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=682.46s)]
*  Charlie Dagina at the Pentagon. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=684.1s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=685.5799999999999s)]
*  To summarize our breaking news from the Middle East, Israel's foreign minister says Hamas [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=686.5799999999999s)]
*  leader Yahya Sinwar is dead, killed during an Israeli military operation in southern [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ldvKVVEPMM&t=691.3s)]
