# Biden looks to secure hostage release, Gaza cease-fire deal before administration's end
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY)
*  STICKING WITH THE MIDDLE EAST NOW, THE SITUATION THERE IS TOP OF MIND FOR MANY AMERICAN VOTERS. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=0.0s)]
*  AND SOME ARE WATCHING AS THE WHITE HOUSE RENEWS ITS PUSH FOR A CEASEFIRE IN GAZA. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=4.18s)]
*  CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT NATALIE BRAND IS ON THE NORTH LAWN AT THE WHITE HOUSE. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=9.24s)]
*  AND SHE JOINS ME NOW TO TALK MORE ABOUT THIS. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=13.24s)]
*  So, Natalie, as you know, the president and others have been trying and failing to negotiate [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=15.0s)]
*  with Israel on this ceasefire deal for months. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=19.64s)]
*  We understand that the president wanted this to be sort of the centerpiece of his final [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=21.88s)]
*  months in office. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=27.76s)]
*  And right now it doesn't seem like he's any closer to getting that deal. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=29.8s)]
*  But, Vlad, it remains a top priority. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=34.04s)]
*  And as you heard from Secretary Blinken, there is a sense and a hope that with Hamas leader [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=37.64s)]
*  Sinwar gone, as the secretary said, there could be a new opportunity to kind of reenergize [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  these negotiations, the White House, the Biden administration doing everything it can publicly [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  and behind the scenes to try to move this ceasefire hostage release deal forward and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=56.82s)]
*  also try to in, you know, the president's remaining time in office, try to lay out the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=64.5s)]
*  Biden administration's vision, plans for what happens after the conflict ends. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=70.88s)]
*  That's why we are seeing the administration and the secretary of state engage this week [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=78.88s)]
*  Israeli partners and Arab partners to try to really discuss not only how to end the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=85.5s)]
*  current crisis, but what happens after. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=91.02s)]
*  As you know, the administration has long talked about a two state solution. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=94.74s)]
*  So now, you know, with weeks left, they're really trying to to lay out their vision and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=99.62s)]
*  move that forward. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=105.92s)]
*  Nicole, Natalie, we also heard from former President Trump over the weekend who claims [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=107.72s)]
*  Israeli prime minister calls him occasionally, including recently. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=112.62s)]
*  Does that complicate these negotiations for the Biden administration? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=119.42s)]
*  The timing of this flat is so unique, just less than two weeks from election day. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  And it can be confusing and kind of complicated if the two messages from the current president [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=130.66s)]
*  and the former president might be in conflict or at odds with each other. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=136.58s)]
*  Of course, we don't know what what's in those private conversations. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=140.73999999999998s)]
*  But at the end of the day, it's so important to remember that while Israel and Prime Minister [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=144.29999999999998s)]
*  Netanyahu, you know, listen to American partners, especially given all of the security [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=149.5s)]
*  assistance that the U.S. provides at the end of the day, Israel and the prime minister have [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=155.29999999999998s)]
*  said they are going to do what they need to do. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=159.14s)]
*  They believe to to further their national security interests. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=162.73999999999998s)]
*  So obviously, there's a lot of communication with the United States. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=166.42s)]
*  But what Israel does and how it does it is really, at the end of the day, a decision by [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=170.34s)]
*  Israel. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=176.98s)]
*  All right, Natalie Brand for us coming to us from the White House. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=177.98s)]
*  Thank you, Natalie. Appreciate it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBDhaM8JmY&t=181.54s)]
