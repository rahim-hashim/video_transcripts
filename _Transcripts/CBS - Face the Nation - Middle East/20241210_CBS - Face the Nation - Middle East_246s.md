# Israel reportedly carries out strikes in Syria after Assad regime's collapse
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A)
*  U.S. prosecutors have charged two former high-ranking Syrian officials with war crimes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=0.0s)]
*  They're accused of overseeing the torture of civilian detainees, including American [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=6.0s)]
*  citizens. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=10.44s)]
*  The downfall of the Assad regime in Syria has raised hopes that more information could [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=11.44s)]
*  come to light on the whereabouts of U.S. citizen Austin Tice. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=15.84s)]
*  Tice, a Marine veteran and freelance journalist, disappeared over 12 years ago while reporting [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=20.0s)]
*  on the Syrian civil war. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=26.2s)]
*  CBS News spoke with White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby and Tice's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=28.32s)]
*  family yesterday. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=34.0s)]
*  The events that unfolded over the weekend in Damascus may present an opportunity to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=37.04s)]
*  get a little bit more information about where he is, what condition he's in, and what we [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=41.64s)]
*  may be able to do to get him home. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=47.32s)]
*  It's a really unique moment over the course of the last 12 years that we've been advocating [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=48.88s)]
*  to bring him home. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  One of the things that we truly believe is in chaos there is opportunity. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=53.76s)]
*  So this is the moment to reach out to any and all organizations or individuals to do [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=58.16s)]
*  anything in their power, anything they can do to help us bring him home. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=64.16s)]
*  And for more on the Israeli reaction to events in Syria, we're joined by CBS News Foreign [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=69.12s)]
*  Correspondent Deborah Pater. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=74.44s)]
*  Deborah, great to have you with us this morning. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=76.16s)]
*  A Syrian war monitor is reporting that Israel has launched over 300 airstrikes over Syria [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=78.68s)]
*  since the fall of the Assad regime. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=85.04s)]
*  I know things are fast developing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=87.4s)]
*  What can you tell us about Israel's military response to what's happening in Syria? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=89.16s)]
*  Well, first off, Errol, the stunning collapse of the Assad regime took Israel by surprise [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=96.12s)]
*  like much of the Middle East. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=100.72s)]
*  But as you pointed out, they have wasted no time using the confusion of what exactly happens [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=103.2s)]
*  next in Syria to carry out those hundreds of strikes across Syria, including the capital [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=108.48s)]
*  of Damascus. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=115.08s)]
*  And that is, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=116.08s)]
*  It says it's documented more than 300 since the fall of the Assad regime. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=121.84s)]
*  Israeli warplanes have been targeting military facilities of the Syrian army. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  These include weapon warehouses, ammunition depots, airports, naval bases, and research [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=133.24s)]
*  centers. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=139.68s)]
*  And they say that this is to prevent weapons falling into the hands of extremists during [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=140.76000000000002s)]
*  this transition time. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=147.0s)]
*  But the Syrian rights group that you mentioned there says the strikes have destroyed all [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  the capabilities of the Syrian army and that Syrian land is indeed being violated. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=153.12s)]
*  Errol? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  Tell me more about what's happening inside Israel, because I understand Prime Minister [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=159.6s)]
*  Netanyahu has taken to the stand in an Israeli court. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  What can you tell us about what's happening there? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=168.24s)]
*  Well, absolutely. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=170.32s)]
*  This is a pivotal moment in this long-running trial marking the first time an Israeli Prime [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  Minister has taken the stand as a criminal defendant. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=179.12s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly sought to delay the proceedings in his corruption [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=183.72s)]
*  trial citing the ongoing war in Gaza and security concerns. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=189.58s)]
*  But today, he said he's waited eight years for this moment. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=194.02s)]
*  He has denied any wrongdoing and called the charges absurd. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=197.52s)]
*  It's an easy day in court for him on the stand, though, as he is only being questioned by [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=202.46s)]
*  his defence lawyer. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=206.66000000000003s)]
*  But it is definitely a low point in what is really his decades-long political career, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=208.62s)]
*  Errol. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=213.54000000000002s)]
*  He's obsessed with his image and wants to be seen as a respected international statesman. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=214.54s)]
*  The stand's in stark contrast to being in the dock. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=221.34s)]
*  Those critics have also sought to link his corruption trial to the war in Gaza, saying [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=224.66s)]
*  the allegations led the Prime Minister to attempt a contentious judicial overhaul last [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=228.98s)]
*  year that bitterly divided this country and created an image of weakness, which really [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=234.22s)]
*  encouraged the October 7 attack. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=238.7s)]
*  Errol? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=241.06s)]
*  Significant updates from your part of the world. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=242.06s)]
*  Deborah Pada, thank you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XWy2yNDH4A&t=244.06s)]
