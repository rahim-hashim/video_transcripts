# Examining state of U.S.-Israel relations amid pause on arms shipment
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M)
*  The White House late last night, after spending about three days denying or ignoring questions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=0.0s)]
*  about this, actually confirmed that there had been a delay of an arms shipment to Israel [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=5.14s)]
*  from the U.S. government. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=9.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, CIA Director Bill Burns is continuing ongoing, almost ceaseless efforts to try to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=10.6s)]
*  broker a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=16.22s)]
*  Burns met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem today. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=21.76s)]
*  Margaret Brennan joins me now here at the desk. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=25.44s)]
*  Margaret, of course, is our chief foreign affairs correspondent and the moderator of Face the Nation. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=27.92s)]
*  What is Bill Burns trying to do, Margaret? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=33.2s)]
*  Bill Burns is trying to do something that the Israeli government doesn't seem able to do, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  which is to get 132 hostages out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=39.24s)]
*  But really what's driving this is the idea that he can pause for some period of time [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=42.28s)]
*  the fighting, even in a limited way. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=47.16s)]
*  And the CIA director is not typically in the role of essentially being the top diplomat, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=49.64s)]
*  but he is in this case. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=55.16s)]
*  He's someone who knows the region well. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=56.31999999999999s)]
*  He's back in Cairo as of this hour, we know, to continue some of these technical talks. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  But if you noticed in that White House readout yesterday, it was President Biden who briefed [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=64.8s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, on the status of the hostage talks. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=70.0s)]
*  It is the U.S. really driving this and trying to force it because they also see it as the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  only way to get the fighting to stop in the short term, to allow in humanitarian aid to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=78.5s)]
*  stop the famine in the North and to allow for some kind of resetting of positions. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=83.52s)]
*  And how would you, Margaret, describe the status of the relationship between the United [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=89.36s)]
*  States and Israel at this moment? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  It feels fraught. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=96.0s)]
*  Well, I would say it is fraught when it comes to the Netanyahu government, most certainly. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  But the United States and Israel, in terms of their security partnership, as their IDF [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=102.32s)]
*  spokesperson came out and said today, is at an unprecedented scale. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=106.16s)]
*  I mean, Joe Biden, the president of the United States, just ushered through $26 billion in aid. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=109.36s)]
*  When we talk about this short term pause of these dumb bombs, the 3500 bombs, about half [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=114.08s)]
*  of which are 2000 pound munitions, this is a sliver of the amount of U.S. taxpayer weaponry [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=120.08s)]
*  that is provided to the Israeli military. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  And so when you have this kind of pause, it is a big deal simply because Israel was told [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=129.04s)]
*  in any way by the White House to slow their role, essentially, here when it comes to what [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=133.52s)]
*  they're doing in Rafa in southern Gaza. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=138.0s)]
*  But in the scale of things, it is not necessarily leaving them without the weapons that they need [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=140.56s)]
*  in this immediate moment in time. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=146.96s)]
*  And Senate Republicans are quick to argue that Israel is being left in the lurch. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=148.88s)]
*  But U.S. officials would say their stockpiles and their weaponsry and their surging of materials [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=153.2s)]
*  is continuing to happen. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=159.44s)]
*  And there's this ongoing conversation between the United States and Israel over the scope [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=160.88s)]
*  of whatever may happen in Rafa. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=165.28s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=168.4s)]
*  And you hear it's interesting, Major, this story has just become a U.S. domestic political [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=169.04s)]
*  story as well, because you also see half of congressional Democrats now signing on to say [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=174.56s)]
*  the United States should withhold offensive weapons, not defensive, not the Iron Dome, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=179.52s)]
*  not David Slane, not any of the things that would stop someone from bombing inside of Israel. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=184.48s)]
*  But to say to Israel, if you are fighting a just war, which is what Biden says, the Israeli [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=188.88s)]
*  government is waging here in terms of fighting Hamas, then you need to fight that just war in a [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=194.16s)]
*  just fashion and do so within the parameters of established international and U.S. law. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=199.84s)]
*  And these congressional Democrats, who just every single week we see a public letter saying [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=204.56s)]
*  that Israel is in violation of the Foreign Assistance Act by blocking aid. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=208.8s)]
*  You see these extremist settlers who just attacked delivery trucks from Jordan, for example, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=213.6s)]
*  that were going into Gaza. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=218.32s)]
*  You see political protests. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=220.16s)]
*  You see right wing ministers who just recently were in control of the delivery of aid and had [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=222.08s)]
*  blocked U.S. taxpayer provided flour from being allowed in. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=226.08s)]
*  You have layers and layers of problems within this very politically shaky right wing government. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=229.52s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu is trying to keep together at the same time he's trying to also [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  negotiate his relationship with the United States and some of the hardline positions that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=241.28s)]
*  are politically expedient to him, such as not necessarily leading first with the hostages, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  but rather with the war. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=251.68s)]
*  There's some real deep questioning within the Biden administration to get back to your [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=254.96s)]
*  initial question as to what his motivations are. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=259.52s)]
*  And if he is seeing clearly the end game that they believe the hostages should be a top priority, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  they believe that being able to strategically defeat Hamas is more important here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  And the minute we have left, Margaret, can you describe, as we know it, the situation for [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=275.04s)]
*  civilians trapped in this place of famine and heartache and devastation? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=280.48s)]
*  Major, I was just looking at a log of some of the footage that our producer Marwan Al Ghul [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=286.0s)]
*  helped to feed out so that we have eyes on the ground because international journalists [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=291.44s)]
*  are not permitted in with very few exceptions. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=296.16s)]
*  And only with Israeli military sensors are they allowed in at this point. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=298.48s)]
*  We don't get that unvarnished view unless it's because of these producers like Marwan. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  And what he fed out was absolute devastation. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=307.76s)]
*  Interviews with doctors at hospitals who said they cannot even get medicines at this point [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=310.32s)]
*  because that Rafa gate crossing has been blocked. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=314.4s)]
*  So Rafa is already under an aerial bombardment. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  This is already the most densely populated place in the world. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=320.32s)]
*  The U.S. says there are 1.4 million people there. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=323.28s)]
*  And when you hear those numbers, like the 35,000 that the Gaza Ministry of Health says, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=325.92s)]
*  the U.N. also says and the U.S. says are pretty accurate, that's only the bodies they found. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=330.0s)]
*  It doesn't account for the people under the rebel. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=335.36s)]
*  So when you hear 15,000 children, assume that's an underestimate. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=337.68s)]
*  That gives you a description of the level of devastation, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=341.52s)]
*  as does the word famine that I don't think we can fully appreciate [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=344.64s)]
*  being manmade in this portion of the world. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=348.0s)]
*  So that is what is driving some of these critics who are saying [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=350.24s)]
*  if the United States is going to be funding this war, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=354.72s)]
*  they want to be able to have a say in how it is prosecuted [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  and be able to stay in accordance with existing U.S. law, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=363.68s)]
*  like the Leahy Act and President Biden's own national security memorandum. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=366.88s)]
*  And stay tuned for that because he does have to report to Congress [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=370.0s)]
*  whether Israel is living up to the standards. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=372.96s)]
*  Maybe some delays in that, but that's expected any day now. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=375.76s)]
*  Unparalleled expertise and perspective. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  Margaret Brennan, as always, thank you so very much. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDUTUTuAc5M&t=380.15999999999997s)]
