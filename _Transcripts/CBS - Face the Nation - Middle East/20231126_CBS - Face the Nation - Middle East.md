# Gaza could possibly be "on the brink of famine," Cindy McCain says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc)
*  And we turn now to the executive director of the World Food Program, Cindy McCain, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=0.0s)]
*  also part of the United Nations. Director McCain, we just heard this ceasefire is bringing some aid [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=5.04s)]
*  into Gaza, but UNICEF just published some information saying that there is a life-threatening [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=13.44s)]
*  form of malnutrition in children that could increase by nearly 30 percent in Gaza. Weakened [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=21.76s)]
*  immune systems, weight loss, death from illness like common cold and diarrhea. They are talking [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=28.08s)]
*  simply about the children who make up half the population. What are you doing to prevent this [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=34.56s)]
*  from happening? Well, thank you for having me. First of all, the bottom line here is that we [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=40.08s)]
*  need to get more aid in, as has been said. We are looking at possibly being on the brink of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=47.68s)]
*  famine in this region. This is something that's not only terrific, but it will spread. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=55.84s)]
*  And with that comes disease and everything else that you can't imagine. Bottom line, we need more [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  trucks in, we need more aid in, we need to be able to have more access to be able to distribute the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=67.68s)]
*  aid. And hopefully maybe a longer time to do that, not just four days. We look forward to making sure [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=73.04s)]
*  that we can work with all of our partners on the ground and in the area to make sure that this can [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=81.52s)]
*  happen. And I want to thank the Egyptians for being so helpful in all of this. UNICEF also said [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=86.72s)]
*  approximately 30,000 children under the age of five in Gaza had stunted growth. And this was even [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=93.52s)]
*  before the war began. Right. Why? Well, the access for aid again prior to the war and then of course [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=99.92s)]
*  since the war has been an issue all along. And the ability to make sure that these children get the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=110.64s)]
*  proper nutrients, not just food, but the proper nutrients in this. It's a terrific situation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  It is a massive catastrophic event that is occurring and it will cross regions as it happens. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=124.8s)]
*  We have got to be able to get in there. And not only that, we have to make sure [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=132.4s)]
*  that we can safely have access to be able to feed the people that we need to feed. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=136.56s)]
*  So far we've fed about 110,000 since the ceasefire, but we need to do a lot more than that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=140.88s)]
*  For the next generations, no doubt. I know you are looking at the entire globe here [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=148.4s)]
*  and there is a lot of need right now. I read that the World Food Program had to cut off 10 million [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=154.88s)]
*  people in Afghanistan. In Africa, you have announced you have to end food aid for more [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=161.76s)]
*  than a million people in Chad, suspend aid in Nigeria, in Khar and Cameroon. How do you [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=167.44s)]
*  possibly prioritize need and how do you decide who to cut off? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  Margaret, it's something that keeps me awake at night and that's the honest truth. It's very [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=181.76s)]
*  difficult to do. But the problem is not just the ability to not be able to feed, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=187.76s)]
*  but the problem is the world needs to step up and help us. Cutting off 10 million people, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=195.84s)]
*  primarily women and children in Afghanistan, it's deadly. It will kill the country. So we've got [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=202.64s)]
*  to be able to make sure that we can get aid in and more importantly we need our countries around [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=210.0s)]
*  the world, not just the United States, but every country in the world, to step up and help us [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=214.16s)]
*  to feed people who cannot feed themselves. The last time we spoke you emphasized that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=219.6s)]
*  some countries could provide technology, advice on how to do it if they don't want to kick in [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=226.4s)]
*  money. China, of course, is one of those countries that's been pressed to do more here. Are you seeing [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=231.2s)]
*  anything more? Well, I'm seeing other countries, yes, step up and offer things and begin to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=237.68s)]
*  work with us on a daily basis to see how we can better improve, not just what we give, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=244.08s)]
*  but how it's grown and can be grown with less water, more technology. It's a series of things [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  to try to combat not only climate change, but the effects of COVID as well as conflict. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  It's a long-range prospect, but we do need the technology. And specifically, the crisis was [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which is such a breadbasket for the world. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=269.84s)]
*  How significant is that conflict now on supply? Well, as you know, it has managed to really [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=275.2s)]
*  devastate many countries, not just from not having enough grain to be able to distribute, but also [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=284.79999999999995s)]
*  enough money to be able to do that. The Russian invasion has caused catastrophic effects that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=292.0s)]
*  have dribbled all the way down through Africa, as was mentioned and so forth. Ukraine was very [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=299.44s)]
*  significant in all of this. We are getting grain out. As you know, it's going in different [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=305.68s)]
*  directions, but we are getting some out. But this is a catastrophic event, as I said, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=309.76s)]
*  and it's affected nearly every country in the world. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=315.68s)]
*  Well, Director McCain, we thank you for working on these hard issues and your time today. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKX5cboMdc&t=319.20000000000005s)]
