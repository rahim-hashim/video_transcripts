# Kamala Harris says Hamas leader's death gives us opportunity to end Gaza war
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM)
*  I'm told that Vice President Harris is speaking on this very topic, so we're going to head over there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=0.0s)]
*  ...are better off as a result. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=5.28s)]
*  Sinwar was responsible for the killing of thousands of innocent people, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=8.0s)]
*  including the victims of October 7 and hostages killed in Gaza. He had American blood on his hands. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Today, I can only hope that the families of the victims of Hamas feel a sense and measure of relief. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=22.16s)]
*  Sinwar was the mastermind of October 7, the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=30.96s)]
*  a terrorist attack that killed 1,200 innocent people and included horrific sexual violence [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  and more than 250 hostages taken into Gaza, including seven Americans living and deceased [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=47.36s)]
*  who remain in captivity. A terrorist attack that triggered a devastating war in Gaza, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=55.36s)]
*  a war that has led to unconscionable suffering of many innocent Palestinians [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=63.44s)]
*  and greater instability throughout the Middle East. In the past year, American special operations [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=71.2s)]
*  and intelligence personnel have worked closely with their Israeli counterparts to locate and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=78.8s)]
*  track Sinwar and other Hamas leaders, and I commend their work. And I will say, to any terrorist [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  who kills Americans, threatens the American people, or threatens our troops or our interests, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=95.36s)]
*  know this, we will always bring you to justice. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=104.08s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend itself, and the threat Hamas poses to Israel must be eliminated. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=107.44s)]
*  Today, there is clear progress toward that goal. Hamas is decimated and its leadership is eliminated. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  This moment gives us an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=127.36s)]
*  and it must end such that Israel is secure. The hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=134.08s)]
*  and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  And it is time for the day after to begin without Hamas in power. We will not give up on these [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=152.8s)]
*  goals, and I will always work to create a future of peace, dignity, and security for all. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=162.96s)]
*  I thank you all. Is the U.S. asking Israel to end the war now? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=170.96s)]
*  All right, we just heard the vice president speaking there. These are the first remarks [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=176.96s)]
*  that we're hearing really from the administration following the confirmation by Israel of the death [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=181.2s)]
*  of Yaya Sinwar, the architect of October 7th. She said that this is an opportunity to end the war. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=186.48s)]
*  An opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza, talking about the necessity to both ensure Israel's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=192.48s)]
*  security and self-determination for the Palestinian people. CBS News political director, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=199.2s)]
*  Finn Gomez, joins me now. Finn, what can we make of these comments by the vice president? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=205.04s)]
*  I think that in her comments here that we just heard on the death of Sinwar, I think, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  you know, in speaking with Democrats close to her campaign, they do believe that one of her [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=216.72s)]
*  strengths is foreign policy, and they do believe that she can be presidential in this space. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=224.55999999999997s)]
*  And I think what you saw today was, you know, an attempt to do that, and an attempt to do that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=231.11999999999998s)]
*  emphatically. I mean, as you mentioned her saying, it gives an opportunity to finally end the war in [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=237.76s)]
*  Gaza and also did also speak about the people in Gaza and how they can have that self-determination [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=242.72s)]
*  to have a Gaza without Hamas in power. And also I thought it was very notable that in her remarks [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=253.04s)]
*  just now, she said very, very emphatically again that this, you know, that it is also a warning [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=259.12s)]
*  to any terrorist that kills Americans, threatens our troops or our interests. Know this, we will [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=266.96s)]
*  always bring you to justice. And I think if there's a memorable takeaway line, Lana, in these very [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=273.36s)]
*  poignant and tough remarks here, I think it would be that line there. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=281.76s)]
*  Yeah, and especially describing to her constituency, the American people, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=285.76s)]
*  that Sinwar has American blood on his hands. Obviously, these comments come in an important [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=292.0s)]
*  moment in the Israel-Gaza war, but it also comes as we are so close to the U.S. presidential election. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=298.72s)]
*  Certainly, that moment looked presidential. I'm wondering if we've had any comments yet from the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=305.6s)]
*  Trump campaign. Not yet, but we do expect some. I did reach out to some senior advisors on the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  Trump campaign just before this segment with you. Usually, Lana, in the traditional sense of these [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=319.04s)]
*  presidential cycles, while something that, you know, there are many voters who assess foreign [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=330.56s)]
*  policy, it's not typically on the top of the list of top issues, right? I think in this cycle, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=335.76s)]
*  specifically, it has been the foreign policy and the respective approaches to foreign policy that [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=343.52s)]
*  we're seeing between these two campaigns is something that is significant. It's something that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=351.35999999999996s)]
*  many Americans are considering, especially in comparison to previous cycles. And it's not just [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=357.44s)]
*  Gaza, which has had a huge political imprint on the political landscape as well, even early on, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=362.96s)]
*  dividing the Democratic Party. You still see some division within that, within the party. But, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=371.12s)]
*  if you look at Ukraine, if you look, obviously, the war that is currently happening, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=379.12s)]
*  it is in the Middle East. I think with all this combined, early on, Afghanistan, all of it combined [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=387.2s)]
*  has brought this issue to the top of the list, near the top of the list. And I think that is also [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=394.0s)]
*  in a cycle with many unprecedented sort of places that we have seen so far. I think this is also [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=402.24s)]
*  something that should be regarded as unique to this cycle. All right. Finn Gomez, thank you. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=409.44s)]
*  Thank you, Lana. We will have continuing coverage of this major development in the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=414.88s)]
*  Israel-Hamas war just after a quick break. I'm Lana Zaks. Stay with us. You're streaming CBS News 24 7. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qbhyo7mHM&t=419.52s)]
