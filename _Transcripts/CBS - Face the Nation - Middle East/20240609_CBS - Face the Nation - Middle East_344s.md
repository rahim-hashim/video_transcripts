# "Famine could happen" in south of Gaza amid Israel-Hamas war, Cindy McCain says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw)
*  We're joined now by the executive director of the United Nations World Food Program, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=0.0s)]
*  Cindy McCain. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=4.92s)]
*  Good to have you here in person. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=5.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=7.48s)]
*  Now, overnight, we learned that that US pier off of Gaza that was set up by the military [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=8.48s)]
*  has reopened. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=13.86s)]
*  It had stopped functioning for a bit. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=14.86s)]
*  How is it going? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=18.54s)]
*  Because I know you are helping to oversee distribution. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=19.62s)]
*  Well, right now we're paused because I'm concerned about the safety of our people after the incidents [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=22.56s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=28.52s)]
*  We also, two of our warehouses, the warehouse complex, were rocketed yesterday. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=29.62s)]
*  So we've stepped back just for the moment to make sure that we're on safe terms and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  on safe ground before we'll restart. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=40.660000000000004s)]
*  But the rest of the country is operational. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=43.7s)]
*  We're doing everything we can in the north and the south. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=46.7s)]
*  How did your locations get rocketed? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=49.22s)]
*  I imagine you do de-conflict and share your locations with the Israeli military. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=52.1s)]
*  We are de-conflicted. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=56.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=57.64s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=58.660000000000004s)]
*  Did you lose any of your— [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=60.52s)]
*  We had one man injured, but everything else is fine. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=61.92s)]
*  Nobody else hurt. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=64.72s)]
*  But indeed, it's a kind of thing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=66.04s)]
*  That's why a ceasefire is necessary. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=69.28s)]
*  That's why we need to stop this so that we can get in at scale with our aid and other [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=71.36s)]
*  aid from other organizations as well. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=77.28s)]
*  We can't continue this in a way because what almost happened in the north with famine could [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  happen in the south. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=86.2s)]
*  And so that's what we're trying to avoid right now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=88.24s)]
*  And it's been very difficult just because of what's going on. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=91.88s)]
*  We've had looting inside the country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=96.0s)]
*  We've had various problems around with it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  There's always something going on. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=101.36s)]
*  It's very difficult to operate there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=102.88s)]
*  You mentioned just now the full-blown famine in the north. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=105.88s)]
*  When you said that, it got a lot of attention. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=111.44s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu was asked about your comments by NBC and said, quote, Cindy McCain, unfortunately, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=113.76s)]
*  is misinformed. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=120.04s)]
*  The Israeli government's been putting up pictures of food being brought into Gaza. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=122.76s)]
*  They dispute there is famine. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=127.4s)]
*  How does that square with what you are seeing on the ground? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=130.26s)]
*  When I made that comment, my people had seen it on the ground, not only evidence of it, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=133.42000000000002s)]
*  but the actual impact of it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=138.20000000000002s)]
*  Since then, they've allowed us to get more trucks into the north. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=140.48s)]
*  And so we're getting much more food in up there. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=143.84s)]
*  And that will stave it off. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  But listen, the bottom line here is I make choices every day to take food from the hungry [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  to give to the starving. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=154.04s)]
*  We need to ceasefire. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=156.12s)]
*  We need it now so that we can feed. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=157.16s)]
*  And this doesn't happen in the south. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=159.12s)]
*  We're right on the edge in the south of the same thing occurring. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=161.76s)]
*  You're on the edge of famine in the south of Gaza? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=164.67999999999998s)]
*  There's people that are very hungry and don't have access because of the danger, because [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=166.64s)]
*  they've been pushed into the center again. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  So we want to make sure that we can not just get in and feed, but do it at scale. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=174.6s)]
*  They need more than food, too. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  It's water. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=180.55999999999997s)]
*  It's sanitation. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=181.55999999999997s)]
*  It's medicine. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=182.55999999999997s)]
*  So it's all of the above, because famine is not just about starving. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  It's about all the other things, too. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=187.48s)]
*  And I know how difficult I've heard it is to help a child with stunted growth. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=189.6s)]
*  You just said you're taking from the hungry to feed the starving. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=197.24s)]
*  You are dealing with a lot in Sudan as well. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=200.0s)]
*  The United States said paramilitary forces murdered 100 people this past week, including [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=202.48s)]
*  children. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=209.0s)]
*  And I know the Biden administration says the world's not paying enough attention to Sudan. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=211.2s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=216.28s)]
*  And are they already at famine? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=217.28s)]
*  Well, Sudan has the real possibility of becoming the world's largest humanitarian crisis. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  We cannot get food in. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  We can barely get food in. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=229.52s)]
*  And we certainly aren't getting it in at scale. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=230.8s)]
*  And you see the results of what can happen if people aren't fed. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=233.56s)]
*  We're also coming into the lean season, which makes it very difficult many times for our [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=237.12s)]
*  trucks to even operate if they can get in. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=241.24s)]
*  We need more, in same role, we need more crossings. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  We need safe and unfettered access. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=246.94s)]
*  And that's the same for Gaza, by the way, safe and unfettered access and making sure [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=249.57999999999998s)]
*  that we can get in and make sure we can feed at scale. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=253.82s)]
*  Once again, it's about the agreements from various people and various factions and all [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=257.46s)]
*  of this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=262.78s)]
*  Bottom line is people are going to starve to death unless we can get in there. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=263.78s)]
*  We've been talking a whole week long about America's role in the world. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=266.94s)]
*  And the U.S. is still the largest donor to the World Food Program. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=271.74s)]
*  When you were here last June and we spoke, you said you were trying to encourage China [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=275.5s)]
*  to get involved with funding, but also get their expertise with technology and agriculture. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=280.86s)]
*  Are they stepping up at all? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  Are other countries stepping up? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=288.14000000000004s)]
*  Other countries are stepping up. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=290.14000000000004s)]
*  It's not to the scale that it was two years ago, but countries have stepped up. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=292.20000000000005s)]
*  And in the case of Sudan, a few more have stepped up to it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=298.70000000000005s)]
*  Sudan is a forgotten crisis and its implications being a destabilizing factor in that region [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=302.54s)]
*  can have catastrophic effects as it comes down the line. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=309.1s)]
*  So it's really imperative that we get the crossings open, that we have safe access, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=313.42s)]
*  that the various factions understand that we are humanitarian and we need to have the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=318.86s)]
*  access. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=324.38s)]
*  And to your point, U.S. intelligence has said that if this isn't acted upon, that it can [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=325.38s)]
*  contribute to the growth of terrorism. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=330.38s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=332.54s)]
*  Just like in Gaza. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=333.54s)]
*  People will do anything to feed their families. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=334.54s)]
*  And if it comes down to it, terrorism may be the choice they have to make. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=336.54s)]
*  Cindy McCain, thank you for sharing with us. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=342.65999999999997s)]
*  Thanks for covering it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hoYNfUAGYw&t=344.65999999999997s)]
