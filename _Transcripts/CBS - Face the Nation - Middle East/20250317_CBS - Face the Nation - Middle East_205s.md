# Houthis vow retaliation after U.S. targets rebel group in Yemen
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw)
*  Tensions are intensifying between the U.S. and Houthi rebels in Yemen after the Pentagon [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=0.0s)]
*  launched airstrikes targeting the Iran-backed militia group over the weekend. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=4.74s)]
*  Houthi officials say at least 53 people were killed, dozens more injured. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  The U.S. says it will keep attacking targets in Yemen until the Houthis stop their assault [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=12.8s)]
*  on global shipping in the Red Sea. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=17.12s)]
*  The rebel group is vowing to retaliate. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=19.04s)]
*  CBS News' senior national security correspondent Charlie Dagana is in Washington with more. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=21.2s)]
*  U.S. officials tell CBS News the first wave of attacks happened on Saturday. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=25.48s)]
*  Then the following day, a U.S. fighter jet shot down around a dozen drones launched over [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=29.96s)]
*  the course of several hours. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=34.24s)]
*  The Houthis then claimed to have fired a ballistic missile that hit the U.S. as Harry S. Truman, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=36.08s)]
*  which is operating in the area. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=41.32s)]
*  Officials tell Us a missile was aimed at the aircraft carrier, but it fell well short, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=43.32s)]
*  crashing into the water. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=47.64s)]
*  Houthi officials say at least 53 people were killed in Yemen as a result of the strikes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=49.32s)]
*  The U.S. has warned more attacks will continue if the Houthis do not stop threatening to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=53.68s)]
*  target shipping lanes in the Red Sea. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=58.76s)]
*  Charlie Dagana, thank you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=61.48s)]
*  CBS News' Middle East reporter Courtney Kaley joins me now in Studio 57. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=62.88s)]
*  So the Iran-backed Houthi rebels are vowing to retaliate. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=66.84s)]
*  They've already launched two unsuccessful attacks on the USS Truman in the Red Sea. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=69.88s)]
*  What can we expect in the next hours, days, weeks? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=74.64s)]
*  Well first of all, what Charlie Dagana did was he quoted what President Trump said on [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=78.76s)]
*  Truth Social, that he's going at Iran. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=82.48s)]
*  He's targeting Iran directly. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=85.76s)]
*  So it's not the Yemenis, he says, the Houthis, which don't represent the Yemenis, but he [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=87.9s)]
*  said it's Iran. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=93.58000000000001s)]
*  Iran is backing this fundamental group. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=94.58000000000001s)]
*  And Iran is now in the back, is peddling back. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=98.7s)]
*  And even the chief of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard said, we have always declared, and we [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=101.9s)]
*  declare today, that the Yemenis are an independent and free nation in their own land, which basically [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  means you're on your own. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=112.86000000000001s)]
*  So already we've seen Hezbollah decimated Hamas. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=114.86s)]
*  The Houthis started these strikes in October 2023 in support of Palestinians in Gaza, and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=119.06s)]
*  they've continued this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=125.82s)]
*  We've seen a change in the administration. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=126.94s)]
*  We've seen changes with Israel and those strikes. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=128.46s)]
*  And what we're really seeing is a much bigger geopolitical situation than just this small [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=131.38s)]
*  country. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=137.54s)]
*  What is the end game for the Houthis? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=138.54s)]
*  Well, the end game for the Houthis is really unclear to actually rule and take over southern [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=140.61999999999998s)]
*  Yemen potentially. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=144.94s)]
*  And they are not represented by the Yemeni people, say they do not and are not represented [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=146.89999999999998s)]
*  by this. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  They've been at war basically with Saudi Arabia for over a decade, approximately a decade [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=153.01999999999998s)]
*  now. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=157.73999999999998s)]
*  And there's been this Shia-Sunni battle playing out there like it has in many other countries. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=158.73999999999998s)]
*  But since the Hamas massacres, since the decimation of Hamas and Hezbollah, it's now the Houthis [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=163.38s)]
*  that are still getting that Iranian support, even though the Iranian Revolutionary Guard [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  Chief said no. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=174.62s)]
*  And what President Trump looks like he's trying to do is say, Iran, stop it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=176.14s)]
*  He's already sent a letter to Iran saying he wants to engage in nuclear talks. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=181.01999999999998s)]
*  And tomorrow in Riyadh, the one thing that people don't know about this, because it's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=184.45999999999998s)]
*  complicated, is that Russia was backing the Houthis when Biden was backing Ukraine. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=188.62s)]
*  And Russia was backing the Houthis through the Iranian intermediaries. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=194.68s)]
*  So I'm sure out of the long list of things they're going to talk about, they will be [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=198.5s)]
*  addressing that as well. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=202.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=203.3s)]
*  Courtney and Keely, thank you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN24MLQ0stw&t=204.3s)]
