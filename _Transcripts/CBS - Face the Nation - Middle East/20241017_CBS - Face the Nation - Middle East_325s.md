# What we know about Israeli operation that killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI)
*  Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us here on CBS News 24-7. I'm Lana Zach. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=0.0s)]
*  Today has the potential to be a major turning point in the Israel Hamas war. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=5.2s)]
*  Israeli officials confirmed Hamas leader and October 7th architect Yaya Sinwar [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=10.0s)]
*  is dead. The IDF says it killed three militants in an operation earlier and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=14.68s)]
*  used dental records and DNA evidence to confirm one of them was in fact Sinwar. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=19.36s)]
*  Hamas has yet to confirm his death. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=23.68s)]
*  spoke earlier urging Hamas to take down their weapons and to release the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=28.36s)]
*  remaining hostages. He went on to say that releasing the hostages would bring [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=32.4s)]
*  the end of the war closer. Senior National Security correspondent Charlie [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=36.56s)]
*  Daggett is at the Pentagon with more. Charlie what are you hearing from your [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  sources there at the Pentagon? Well throughout the morning they've been [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  tracking this. They've been tracking the information coming out from their IDF [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=49.68s)]
*  colleagues about the killing of the suspected killing at that point of Sinwar. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=53.28s)]
*  And I think we have to remember as the vice president pointed out earlier just [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=59.0s)]
*  moments ago, US special operations and intelligence surveillance reconnaissance [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=63.72s)]
*  has very much been involved in the tracking of Sinwar. He's been public [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=69.2s)]
*  enemy number one and remember he's got blood on his hands for American deaths. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=73.56s)]
*  So this is very much a joint venture for the United States and Israeli forces on [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=77.8s)]
*  the ground certainly in terms of the the intelligence sharing. So they were [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=82.48s)]
*  tracking Sinwar all along. So yes this would be something of a victory here [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=86.56s)]
*  because again this is not a person who's not only responsible for the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=91.56s)]
*  killing of Israelis but killing for American citizens as well. I'm [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  wondering if you can tell us anything more about given the US's role in [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=98.92s)]
*  targeting Sinwar and other Hamas leaders what we have been able to ascertain [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=102.48s)]
*  about this operation, about the status of any remaining hostages that are along [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=106.68s)]
*  the way. Is Sinwar alive? Yeah well that's the key question in terms of the hostages. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=112.44s)]
*  So in terms of Sinwar, yes they had been tracking him. They knew that he was in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  that area but as we're learning and we're getting this information from the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  IDF because they have eyes on here as they like to put it to see an [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=124.96s)]
*  overwatch of what's going on but they don't have the sort of granular detail [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=129.76s)]
*  on the ground to know and we're going to have a press briefing in just a few [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=133.2s)]
*  minutes. They may get more details about specifically how much they knew about [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=136.56s)]
*  that but they were tracking Sinwar and they knew he was in that region but as [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=140.4s)]
*  we understand this wasn't a targeted killing like what we saw in Lebanon with [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=144.84s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader or Ismail Kha'niya in Iran. So this wasn't a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=150.52s)]
*  strike specifically aimed at taking Sinwar out. And Charlie what else are we [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=159.24s)]
*  hearing from US and Israeli officials particularly about where we go from here? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=166.92s)]
*  Well it's a good question. So we've got a very brief statement from the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=172.0s)]
*  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. He spoke with Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=177.92s)]
*  Gallant. This just came out moments ago today to discuss the reporting of the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=182.04s)]
*  killing of the Hamas leader Yaya Sinwar. This we hear repeatedly. Secretary [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=185.72s)]
*  Austin reaffirmed US support for Israel's right to defend itself, reiterated, but [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=190.56s)]
*  this is where it changes. So he's talking about the THAAD missile defense system. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=194.32s)]
*  Now that's new. That's the first time a missile defense system has been, a US [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=197.96s)]
*  missile defense system has been sent to Israel. It will be operational soon. It [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=202.2s)]
*  will be manned by US personnel, so US boots on the ground in Israel all [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=206.68s)]
*  waiting for a counterattack from Iran because where Israel is positioned now, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=212.04s)]
*  I have to take you back to October 1st, Iran launched an attack with 180 [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=217.6s)]
*  ballistic missiles and cruise missiles much more than many had expected. One of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=223.48s)]
*  the reasons that they've given us here for sending in that missile battery. So [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=228.6s)]
*  where we stand is Israel is still on path to retaliate to Iran for that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=233.23999999999998s)]
*  bombardment. Iran has already said that they will counterpunch, they will [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=239.72s)]
*  retaliate back. Now the question is where we've got Sinwar, is that going to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=244.28s)]
*  provoke the Iranians even more? So if we might see an attack before Israel's [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=249.28s)]
*  attack, and I know we're going back and forth, but that's where it is. What we're [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=254.04s)]
*  all waiting for is Israel's counterattack for what happened on [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=257.36s)]
*  October 1st and then what comes after that. But you know the the scores are [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=260.48s)]
*  being settled here throughout the region. The Israelis have taken out not [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=266.88s)]
*  just Sinwar, but Nasrallah taking taking out Hezbollah leadership and not just [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=271.48s)]
*  Sinwar, but pretty much all of his deputies have been killed as well and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=276.76s)]
*  Haniyeh. So the Israelis, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said moments ago, you [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=281.88s)]
*  know, this isn't like a ceasefire, maybe an opportunity to see if there are more [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  level-headed thinkers within the Hamas organization that might be more open to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=291.88s)]
*  hostage negotiations. But this does not necessarily mean that Israel's war is [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=295.88s)]
*  over. Remember, and I keep saying this, Israel didn't begin this war [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=301.24s)]
*  against Hamas with the objective of defeating Hamas. It was to destroy Hamas. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=306.24s)]
*  So that fight will continue. All right, a lot of good context, particularly that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=312.44s)]
*  reminder about Israel's pledge to respond to Iran. Charlie Dagata, thank you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=317.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo-6vUeCiJI&t=323.72s)]
