Video Description: Israeli forces pressed ahead with heavy bombardment in Gaza overnight Sunday while the head of the U.N.'s World Food Programme warned that half of the population in Gaza faces starvation and a severe lack of clean water. While it's too early to know the outcome of the war, the next big question is who will rule the territory next — and the answer may lie in the West Bank. Charlie D'Agata reports from Tel Aviv.

# Heavy bombardment overnight in Gaza amid discussions over postwar governing plans
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [December 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84)
*  We want to go first to our Charlie Dagata reporting from Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=0.0s)]
*  The southern city of Khan Yunis in flames from a bombardment Israel says is aimed at hunting down [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=5.12s)]
*  Hamas leaders. And with the U.S. alone in vetoing a U.N. Security Council ceasefire proposal, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  anti-American sentiment is higher than ever. These weapons and rockets are made in America, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  says resident Abu Abed Youssef. They support Israel to kill the youth, children and women. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=25.92s)]
*  Even as Israel's military chief tells forces we need to press even harder, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=33.2s)]
*  the head of the U.N.'s World Food Program warned today half the population in Gaza faces starvation [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=39.84s)]
*  and a severe lack of clean water. Save the Children says deaths from starvation and disease [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=47.84s)]
*  might top those killed in bombings. It's becoming too dangerous for aid agencies to operate, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=55.44s)]
*  says spokesperson for the U.N. in Gaza, Juliet Tumi. We have come to a point where we're not [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=62.16s)]
*  sure if we are able to fulfill our mandate and provide assistance to people in need in Gaza. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=70.48s)]
*  This is unprecedented. It's too early to know exactly how the war in Gaza ends. The next big [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=76.08s)]
*  question is who governs the territory next and the answer may lie here in the West Bank. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=83.44s)]
*  We're told post-war plans are already being drawn up with the West Bank's Palestinian authority. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=91.28s)]
*  Can I just confirm that you are in conversations with the United States about the future of Gaza? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  Yes. That's confirmed. Yes, there are discussions. They have ideas. Okay. And we have ideas. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=103.44s)]
*  But those ideas may not be the same. According to Minister of Social Affairs, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=110.32s)]
*  Ahmed Majdalani, their plan would include an element of Hamas as a junior partner, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=114.63999999999999s)]
*  despite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's insistence Hamas must be completely destroyed. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  Maybe Israel, they can destroy his military forces and capability, but they cannot destroy Hamas [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  as an organization. An organization accused of mass murder and still holding more than 130 hostages. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=140.16s)]
*  And families are still no closer to knowing their fate as the season of Hanukkah began. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=152.96s)]
*  Instead of joy, nightly vigils like this one in Tel Aviv. There's not much to celebrate [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=158.96s)]
*  until their loved ones come home. With our colleagues inside Gaza reporting heavy [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=166.56s)]
*  fighting overnight, the UN says it's impossible to get aid into southern Gaza. But Margaret, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=172.72s)]
*  an Israeli military official we spoke to insisted there is a safe corridor leading from the Rafa [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=178.96s)]
*  crossing to so-called safe zones, but the UN just isn't using it. Charlie Dagata, thank you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGyXjQtBq84&t=184.72s)]
