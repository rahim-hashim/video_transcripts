# How U.S.-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander's release was secured
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM)
*  after 19 months in the hands of Hamas, American Idan Alexander is now free. He [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=0.0s)]
*  was released just a short time ago in a handover to the Red Cross at the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Gazan border. Now the dual U. S Israeli citizen was released in a deal aimed [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=10.6s)]
*  at getting a ceasefire in the conflict and resuming delivery of aid into Gaza. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=15.32s)]
*  It is believed there are 24 remaining living hostages of the original 251 [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=20.8s)]
*  taken by Hamas in its attack on Israel on October 7th 2023. Alexander, who is [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=26.88s)]
*  now 21 years old, grew up in New Jersey before moving to Israel, where he was [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=33.32s)]
*  serving in the Israeli military when he was abducted during the Hamas [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  orchestrated attack that sparked the war in Gaza. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=40.98s)]
*  Hundreds there cheering at a watch party for Alexander's release. Family, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=51.08s)]
*  friends and supporters. A huge screen was set up for the crowd showing Israeli [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=55.08s)]
*  news coverage of that release. Crowds began gathering early this morning as [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=59.8s)]
*  word spread of Alexander's impending release. Now the Israeli Defense Forces, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=64.24s)]
*  the idea of just released a statement on need on Alexander's release. It says in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=69.12s)]
*  part quote, the returning hostage has just been transferred to IDF forces in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=73.16s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. The returning hostage is currently being accompanied by IDF [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=77.44s)]
*  special forces on his return to Israeli territory, where he will then undergo an [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=82.08000000000001s)]
*  initial medical assessment and meet with his family. All right for how this is [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  all playing out over the White House. Let's go to CBS News White House [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  reporter Willie James inman Willie. Great to be with you. President Trump has [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  been teasing the release of a Don Alexander for days now, including just [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=97.16000000000001s)]
*  hours before the actual release. How did his administration secure this moment? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=101.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, Liz and happy Monday to you. Well, certainly welcome news for [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=107.4s)]
*  Alexander's family. Mr Alexander's family with his release. The president [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=111.68s)]
*  talked about this earlier today. We know that Steve Wyckoff, his special envoy [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  was in the region and currently still in the region to receive Mr Alexander and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  check about his condition. We know that the White House has been really pushing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  for not only the release of a Don Alexander, but also the release of the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=132.98000000000002s)]
*  remains of the Americans who have been held by Hamas. The president touched on [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=137.70000000000002s)]
*  that earlier talking about how the families have really advocated for the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=143.54000000000002s)]
*  release, even expressing personal pleas directly to him. Also to his national [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=147.52s)]
*  security team. We know that that has happened not only with the Biden [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  administration, but with the Trump administration as well. We have seen [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=155.18s)]
*  the families come here time and time again to advocate for the release of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=158.22s)]
*  the remaining hostages. Do you want to bring up a post from the president [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=162.10000000000002s)]
*  himself that he posted just a while ago? He said, Don Alexander, the last [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=166.18s)]
*  living American hostage is being released. He goes on to say congratulations [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=170.38s)]
*  to his wonderful parents, family and friends. We know, of course, that the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=174.22s)]
*  president is headed to the Middle East. Certainly conversation surrounding a [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=178.98000000000002s)]
*  more lasting ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas will be a top [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=184.72s)]
*  conversation with the leaders in the region that the president meets. He's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=189.38s)]
*  going to travel to three different nations, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=193.06s)]
*  United Arab Emirates over the next couple of days. Liz. All right, so let's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=196.74s)]
*  talk a little bit about this four day trip. Willie, I mean, you mentioned [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=200.58s)]
*  cutter is on the list and that country recently gifted the president a plane [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=203.66s)]
*  that he says he will use as Air Force one. I can imagine there are some [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=208.94s)]
*  limitations, legal limitations to gifts of this magnitude. And I know he's [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=213.7s)]
*  getting some criticism on both sides of the aisle for this. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=218.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, this raised a lot of eyebrows as we reported this story out yesterday. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=222.45999999999998s)]
*  And now the jet itself is 7 47 dash eight for those aviation enthusiasts [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=227.61999999999998s)]
*  out there is a more updated modern version of the 7 47 that traditionally [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=232.26s)]
*  it travels with the president that the president president travels aboard on [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=237.61999999999998s)]
*  those long distance flights. So that's the bigger jet with the four engines [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=241.76s)]
*  essentially there. This would be a more modern version of that plane. The [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=246.05999999999997s)]
*  president has really blasted Boeing for delays of the new Air Force one. That [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=250.78s)]
*  certainly won't come to fruition anytime soon. And this jet that the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=257.14s)]
*  Qatari royal family has donated says they will donate. Now Qatar is actually [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=261.47999999999996s)]
*  saying, Look, this is still under consideration. No decision has been [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=266.26s)]
*  made yet. They released that statement when I asked them about the situation. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=271.82s)]
*  But the president himself is pushing back against this notion about this [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=276.9s)]
*  multimillion dollar gift. Listen to what he said a little bit earlier. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=281.53999999999996s)]
*  As cutter asked for anything in exchange for that $400 million luxury jumbo jet. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=286.21999999999997s)]
*  And how can the American people be so sure that they will not in the future? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=292.61999999999995s)]
*  Well, I think what happens with the plane is that you know, we're very [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=295.97999999999996s)]
*  disappointed that it's taking Boeing so long to build a new Air Force one. You [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=298.86s)]
*  know, we have an Air Force one that's 40 years old. And if you take a look at [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=302.46000000000004s)]
*  that compared to the new plane of the equivalent, you know, stature at the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=306.42s)]
*  time, it's not even the same ballgame. I could be a stupid person to say, Oh, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=310.5s)]
*  no, we don't want a free plane. We give free things that will take one too. And [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=314.34000000000003s)]
*  it helps us out because again, we're talking about we have 40 year old [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=318.90000000000003s)]
*  aircraft. The money we spend, the maintenance we spend on those planes to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=322.90000000000003s)]
*  keep them tippy top is astronomical. You wouldn't even believe it. So I think [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  it's a great gesture from guitar. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=331.62s)]
*  No, the reason why the president is talking about the money we spend on [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=336.16s)]
*  these planes is so astronomical is because of the amount of money it takes [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  to secure these planes. And they're specially modified jets are not like [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=343.96000000000004s)]
*  the 7 47s commercial jets are. They're similar, but there's so many [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  modifications that go into essentially making this the White House of the sky [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=353.8s)]
*  and the president wouldn't be able to fly this jet back home. In fact, he's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=359.24s)]
*  not doing so on this trip because it would need to be modified. It would need [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=362.32s)]
*  to be checked if it indeed does transfer to from the Qataris to the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=366.34000000000003s)]
*  Department of Defense. So it will be quite a lengthy amount of time. But in [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  terms of the legality of this, the White House says that they're going to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=377.06s)]
*  follow the law. They're saying essentially that they're still going [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  to follow the law, but they're not going to be able to get through the legal [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=382.59999999999997s)]
*  process with this. The emoluments emoluments clause essentially says that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=384.08s)]
*  you cannot accept a gift from a foreign power without permission from Congress. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  So Congress members of Congress have been saying that you need the permission [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=393.47999999999996s)]
*  from them to be able to accept this type of gift, especially what would [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=397.84s)]
*  essentially be the largest and most expensive gift any president has [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=402.82s)]
*  received in American history. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRG02YO_ckM&t=407.67999999999995s)]
