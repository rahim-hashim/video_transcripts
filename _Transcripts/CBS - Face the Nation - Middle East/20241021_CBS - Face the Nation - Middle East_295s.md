# U.S. probing alleged leak of Israel's retaliation plans against Iran
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg)
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday that the U.S. is investigating a security breach [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=0.0s)]
*  that led to the alleged leak of classified documents about Israel's plans to attack Iran. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=4.72s)]
*  The materials became public over the weekend on the messaging app Telegram. The documents, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=9.76s)]
*  first reported by CNN and Axios, detail weapons transfers allegedly intended for a strike on Iran. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=14.48s)]
*  They also say the U.S. is aware of recent Israeli military exercises [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=21.2s)]
*  conducted in preparation for a possible Iranian attack. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=25.04s)]
*  A retaliatory Israeli strike has been expected since Iran fired nearly 200 [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  missiles at Israel earlier this month. Iran says those airstrikes were in response to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=33.28s)]
*  Israel's increased attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon, including the assassination of the group's leader. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  For more on this, I want to bring in CBS News' senior national security correspondent, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=44.08s)]
*  Charlie Dagata. Charlie, thank you for being here. How serious is this leak? How does something like [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  this happen? Well, it's serious and it's obviously sensitive. Defense officials I spoke with here [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  will only say they're looking into it. The question is, was it a leak or was it a hack? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=57.84s)]
*  And if that's the case, where will there be more of them? It first popped up over the weekend [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  on that text app that you said that had previously posted pro-Iranian content. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=68.72s)]
*  Now, they first said it came from a whistleblower at the Department of Defense after saying it was [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=74.72s)]
*  originally a leak from U.S. intelligence. But the Biden administration and others have called it [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=80.08000000000001s)]
*  very concerning. Now they'll have to figure out the source of that leak and try to make sure this [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=85.28s)]
*  isn't the first of many, as we have seen in the past. And if it's legit and we're not being steered [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=89.36s)]
*  away, that it's not, it's not only highly classified information, but it shows how closely [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=94.72s)]
*  the United States is monitoring Israel. So how does this affect how and when Israel might strike at Iran? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, there's not a lot here. I've got the two pages. That's a big giveaway or necessarily [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=107.12s)]
*  compromises Israeli forces. It describes like the positioning and repositioning of weapons, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=113.12s)]
*  getting missile launchers and drones into place, moving some of their own missiles out of harm's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=119.76s)]
*  way. Dispersing is how they described it to keep them safe from an Iranian counterattack. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=124.4s)]
*  At least in these two documents, it isn't like a detailed layout of Israeli forces. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=130.24s)]
*  It's more of a broad overview of Israeli readiness to strike Iran. It is recent. It was October, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=135.36s)]
*  15th and 16th, according to these documents. But for us, it's telling us what we've been told [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=143.12s)]
*  and reporting for several days now, that Israel is and has been in position to launch a significant [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=148.72s)]
*  attack on Iran in retaliation for that Iranian bombardment on October 1st. Are there any [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=155.44s)]
*  indications Israel could use nuclear weapons against Iran? Well, we're not going to read [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=161.28s)]
*  chapter inverse of these documents for obvious operational security reasons, and they're [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=168.4s)]
*  technically classified if they're legit. But there is one single reference to that, which reads, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=172.64s)]
*  we have not observed indications that Israel intends to use a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  What's interesting about that, while it's widely accepted that Israel has nuclear capacity, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=183.68s)]
*  the Israelis have never officially acknowledged that. The U.S. and Israel have always shared a [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  very close-knit relationship. How does this leak affect that? Well, it's not going to help. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=194.48s)]
*  It shouldn't be much of a surprise that the United States has been using its vast [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=200.39999999999998s)]
*  surveillance and intelligence capabilities to get a handle of what's going on in the country and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=204.72s)]
*  outside the country. First and foremost, and we're told that all the time, this is all about the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  protection of tens of thousands of U.S. forces across the region. But there's been frustration, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=213.92s)]
*  some made public, some not, from the White House on down that Israel has been less than forthcoming [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=221.12s)]
*  about informing the U.S. of major operations, like killing Hezbollah leader Hussein Nasrallah. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=226.0s)]
*  The Israeli defense minister was informing the U.S. defense secretary of that operation while it was [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=232.56s)]
*  underway. He was on the phone to him. So the U.S. has sent considerable weapons to the area to defend [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=239.44s)]
*  Israel, including that new THAAD missile defense system. And let's face it, a major strike in Iran [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=244.88s)]
*  has the potential to draw U.S. forces closer into this fight. What are you watching for in the next [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=251.04s)]
*  few days? I think we'll look for movement. What we have been told and we've been asking, we've been [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=256.48s)]
*  asking pretty much on the hour, is it going to happen now? Is it going to happen? And events kind [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=261.92s)]
*  of got in the way, including, you know, the killing of Sinwar last week. But as I said, I just need to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=266.32s)]
*  nail down the fact that those Israeli weapons to launch an attack like the kind that we're [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=274.08s)]
*  expecting, the scale of the attack in terms of drones, in terms of missiles, in terms of their [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=280.08s)]
*  own self-defense, is already set to go. Just waiting to pull a trigger. But, you know, we're [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=284.8s)]
*  told that may not be that far away. Charlie Dagada at the Pentagon, thank you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTJD1nM7-fg&t=290.15999999999997s)]
