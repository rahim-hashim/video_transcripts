# Biden vows "ironclad" support for Israel amid fears of Iran attack
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00)
*  The White House said Thursday it has warned Iran against any retaliatory attack on Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=0.0s)]
*  An Israeli strike last week on the country's consulate in Syria killed several senior Iranian [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=6.68s)]
*  commanders. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=11.72s)]
*  Iran's supreme leader said the attack in Damascus was equivalent to an attack on Iran [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=12.72s)]
*  itself. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=17.56s)]
*  U.S. and Israeli officials are now preparing for Iran to respond. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=18.56s)]
*  And despite differences over the handling of Gaza, President Biden has promised Israel [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=21.68s)]
*  That's his word. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=27.48s)]
*  Support against Tehran. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=29.080000000000002s)]
*  CBS News national security correspondent David Martin joins me now from the Pentagon. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=30.64s)]
*  David, when, when, do we have any sense of what this attack could look like, when it [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=34.88s)]
*  might come? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=39.6s)]
*  Right now, John, U.S. intelligence is monitoring Iran as it makes preparations for a major [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=41.84s)]
*  drone and missile attack against Israel that could come really at any time, perhaps within [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=49.16s)]
*  the next 24 hours. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=56.04s)]
*  And by preparations, I mean moving missiles from out of their storage sites into launch [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=58.24s)]
*  position and putting air defenses on high alert in anticipation of an Israeli counterstrike. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=65.28s)]
*  Now Iran has said that that attack on their consulate in Syria was the same thing as an [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=75.12s)]
*  attack on their soil. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=82.32s)]
*  So Iran seems determined here to take it, take the war back to Israel. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  So we are really at a high stakes moment here, perhaps the highest since October 7th. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=91.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=99.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=100.28s)]
*  Now does it, what kind of capability does Iran have for confrontation with Israel? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=101.28s)]
*  I mean, could it be a, this is going to seem absurd, but a measured strike or what just, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=106.64s)]
*  what does one expect from an Iranian attack? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=111.96s)]
*  Iran has about 75 to 100 ballistic missiles that have a great enough range to reach Israel. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=115.6s)]
*  So that's a significant threat because each one of those missiles can carry a 1,000 pound [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  warhead. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=131.72s)]
*  But you have to remember that Israel has a significant air defense. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  We've seen them use their Iron Dome system against Hamas rockets and it has other systems [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=138.0s)]
*  called Aero and David Sling, which are capable of intercepting longer range ballistic missiles [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=146.28s)]
*  of the kind that Iran might fire. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=155.12s)]
*  But that first volley is only the start of a battle because if Iran strikes Israel, Israel [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=158.2s)]
*  is almost certainly going to strike Iran and Israel with its American made F-35 stealth [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  fighters is certainly likely to come out ahead in an exchange like that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  But the bottom line here, John, is nobody wins if this war becomes a war between Israel [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=179.83999999999997s)]
*  and Iran. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=187.23999999999998s)]
*  And finally, David, on the US question, I mean, so sort of two questions at once. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  But how does this raise the threat for US forces in the region? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=193.64s)]
*  And there's always been a challenge with the US in terms of Israeli responses when it comes [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  to Iran, fearful that they're going to overshoot and do too much. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  How does that get managed? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=207.16s)]
*  Well you've heard the president say that in this case US support for Israel is ironclad [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=209.55999999999997s)]
*  And that means providing Israel with the intelligence and the weapons it needs to take on Iran directly [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=218.64s)]
*  state to state. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=229.32s)]
*  Now, in Iran's eyes, that of course will make the US and all the American troops who [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=230.32s)]
*  are based in the Persian Gulf, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, not Yemen, excuse me, Iraq and Syria, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=237.28s)]
*  that will make them all legitimate targets, whether Iran decides to go after them directly [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=246.96s)]
*  or whether it prefers to use its proxies against American troops, proxies like Hezbollah and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=254.36s)]
*  the militias in Iraq and Syria. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=264.72s)]
*  This war we are on the brink of right now could be a major turning point in this whole [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=268.8s)]
*  series of disasters which began on October 7th. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=275.96s)]
*  A very, very sober moment, David Martin, at the Pentagon. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=279.76s)]
*  Thank you very much, David. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTstM345V00&t=282.84s)]
