Video Description: CIA Director Bill Burns met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel Wednesday, but it's unclear how the meeting went or where cease-fire talks stand. The meeting comes after the U.S. paused a shipment of bombs to Israel due to concerns they could be used in Rafah, a senior Biden administration official told CBS News. CBS News' Ramy Inocencio and David Martin have more.

# CIA director, Israel's Netanyahu meet as U.S. pauses shipments of some weapons
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ)
*  All right, the director of the CIA, that's William Burns, met with Israeli [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel today. That's right. The talks [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=3.22s)]
*  coincide with the U. S. Is growing optimism over the ongoing ceasefire [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=6.86s)]
*  negotiations in Cairo. Israel has reopened a key crossing in Gaza [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  following Hamas's deadly rocket attack earlier this week. The move allows [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=14.94s)]
*  additional humanitarian aid to enter the war torn enclave. Israeli tanks rolled [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=18.86s)]
*  into the Gaza signed of the Rafa border crossing yesterday and seized control. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=23.5s)]
*  Meantime, a senior Biden administration official tells CBS News that the U. S. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=27.799999999999997s)]
*  is now pausing a shipment of bombs because of concern they could be used [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=32.32s)]
*  in Rafa. CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Innocencio is there following [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=37.28s)]
*  these developments from Tel Aviv. So, Remy, let's start with CIA director [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=41.8s)]
*  Bill Burns. He met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today in Israel. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=45.84s)]
*  Anything you can tell us about how those talks went? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=49.4s)]
*  Lana, good to speak with you. Frankly, not very much actually when we're talking [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=51.4s)]
*  about the CIA chief. Basically, CBS News can confirm that Bill Burns did meet [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=58.22s)]
*  with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We have not heard any official [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=63.339999999999996s)]
*  statements come out of it and frankly we may not hear any official statements. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=67.18s)]
*  With that said, there have been local media reports. Reuters, for example, said [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=71.3s)]
*  that the two, according to a senior Israeli official, talked about the possibility [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=76.76s)]
*  of pausing the operations happening in Rafa in exchange for some hostages. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  The well-regarded local newspaper Haaretz said that it doesn't appear that there is [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=87.36000000000001s)]
*  any breakthrough in talks, but they did say that the Israeli delegation that only [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=92.48s)]
*  got to Cairo yesterday will stay on. Another regional news outlet said that the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=97.16000000000001s)]
*  Hamas delegation though in Cairo is set to leave tonight. All this to say is that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=103.28s)]
*  there is a lot of talk, some movement, and we'll just have to see what happens [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=108.06s)]
*  over the next couple days. But just to hammer this home, what people say may [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=113.94s)]
*  not actually mean what they say in terms of eventually what their goal is. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=118.98s)]
*  And let's drill down on that a bit more, Remy, because Rafa is the focal point of the war now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=124.22s)]
*  We saw this footage of tanks rolling in. The complication is that this is also a [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=129.86s)]
*  key humanitarian entry point into Gaza. So where does any of that stand now? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=134.18s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. Well, according to an idea of spokesperson, they said that Israeli [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=142.58s)]
*  soldiers are continuing their operations in eastern Rafa and that they say [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=148.3s)]
*  they've identified four Hamas battalions that they're trying to target. But, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=153.58s)]
*  Ariel, to your point about the humanitarian aspect of these things, while the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=158.5s)]
*  operations for Israel's military carry on, the United Nations has said that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=162.82000000000002s)]
*  fuel is an issue. For example, the three hospitals that are still operating in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=168.18s)]
*  southern Gaza only have a few more days of fuel, which means that any procedures [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=174.22s)]
*  that need to be done for the wounded that are coming in from these military [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=180.62s)]
*  strikes will at some point have to be done without electricity, potentially [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=183.62s)]
*  in the dark. The UN does say also that about 50,000 people in Rafa have now [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=187.78s)]
*  evacuated from the city and from the region, but our own CBS News producer, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=194.9s)]
*  Marwan Alghul, who is in Gaza, has said that there are about 250,000 people in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=200.94s)]
*  the region, which means that there are only about 20% of those people who have [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=206.14s)]
*  left, meaning that there's still a lot of people left in terms of what might [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=209.74s)]
*  happen to them as these Israeli strikes carry on. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=213.56s)]
*  Well, I want to talk a little bit more about humanitarian aid specifically [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=216.16s)]
*  because the U.S. military has completed that floating pier on Gaza's coast. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=221.0s)]
*  That's going to be used to get aid into the territory, but do we know anything [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=226.08s)]
*  more about when those shipments are actually expected to begin? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=229.72s)]
*  Right. No, we haven't gotten any official word just yet about those shipments by sea, and the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=234.28s)]
*  potential reason for this, what we're being told, is that there is a weather [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=241.28s)]
*  forecast of high winds and that has a knock-on effect of having high seas on [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=245.12s)]
*  the Mediterranean. We were at the port of Ashdod earlier today, that's about 30 [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=250.88s)]
*  miles south of Tel Aviv, and what we saw there was that's where the the pier is [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=256.36s)]
*  being completed. We understand that that has now been completed according to the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=263.04s)]
*  Pentagon, and once the seas, the winds die down, it's expected to be towed to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=266.4s)]
*  the Gaza coast, and from there, once it's installed onto the shore, the Pentagon [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=272.35999999999996s)]
*  also says that there is a U.S. flagged cargo ship that's about a couple hundred [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=276.96s)]
*  miles north of here in Cyprus that will then make its way and be the first aid [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=281.79999999999995s)]
*  delivery by sea to Gaza. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  All right, Remy Inacentio, thank you Remy. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  Thanks Remy. Now we want to bring in CBS News National Security Correspondent [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=290.41999999999996s)]
*  David Martin, you see him there joining us from the Pentagon. David, this seems [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=294.56s)]
*  unprecedented, explain more about what we know of the U.S.'s decision to postpone [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=298.44s)]
*  or pause this delivery of military weapons to Israel. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  Well let me just add the first, the latest development, which is that Defense [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  Secretary Austin, who is testifying on Capitol Hill this morning, has just [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  confirmed that the U.S. indeed has paused what he calls one shipment of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  high-payload munitions. Now the most important thing to know about that is [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=324.08s)]
*  that this sends the message that U.S. support for Israel, which the Biden [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=329.47999999999996s)]
*  administration has repeatedly said is ironclad, is no longer [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=336.52s)]
*  unconditional. And specifically what has happened is that the U.S. has paused a [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=343.24s)]
*  shipment of 1,800 2,000 pound bombs and 1,700 500 pound bombs and has explicitly [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=350.2s)]
*  linked that pause to the Biden administration's opposition to Israel's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=359.56s)]
*  plans for a ground invasion of Ra'a. Weapons shipments are the one real source [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=366.48s)]
*  of leverage the U.S. has over Israel and now for the first time since the war [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=374.76s)]
*  with Hamas began they have used it. Well on that then David, I'm wondering what [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=381.12s)]
*  this potentially means for the status of other military shipments to Israel. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  Future deliveries are quote-unquote under review and those are future [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=393.08s)]
*  deliveries of specifically kits that make those 2,500 pound bombs precision [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=400.12s)]
*  guided and make them easier to use in urban areas which is what the U.S. does [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=408.96s)]
*  not want to see. Now Secretary Austin said no decision has been made on either [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=415.68s)]
*  the one shipment that's been paused or on any of these future deliveries but [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=421.8s)]
*  weapons shipments are now on the table and what else is on the table is [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=428.44s)]
*  Republican criticism most vociferously this morning from Senator Lindsey Graham [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=434.23999999999995s)]
*  who called any holdup of shipments to Israel in his words obscene and absurd. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=441.52s)]
*  All right David Martin thanks for that update joining us from the Pentagon. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt7mLrkCdQ&t=449.28s)]
