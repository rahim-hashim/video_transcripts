Video Description: The Trump administration claimed it "obliterated" Iran's key nuclear sites, but CBS News is learning that may not be the case. A preliminary intel assessment finds U.S. strikes on three Iranian facilities over the weekend only set back the country's nuclear program by a few months. CBS News' Nancy Cordes and Charlie D'Agata have the latest.

# Iranian nuclear sites damaged, but not destroyed by U.S. strikes, sources say
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c)
*  Hello, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=0.0s)]
*  The Trump administration claimed it, quote, obliterated Iran's key nuclear sites, but [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=2.0s)]
*  CBS News is learning that may not be the case. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=6.28s)]
*  A preliminary Intel assessment finds U.S. strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  over the weekend only set back the country's nuclear program by a few months. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  That insight comes as President Trump is in the Netherlands for the NATO summit, although [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  the meeting is likely to be overshadowed by developments in the Middle East. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=22.44s)]
*  The president said late yesterday that Israel and Iran had agreed to a complete and total [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=26.28s)]
*  ceasefire after nearly two weeks of fighting. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=31.04s)]
*  Both sides were still trading strikes up to the moment the agreement went into effect. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=34.36s)]
*  Israel says an Iranian missile killed at least four people before the ceasefire took hold. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=38.92s)]
*  Israeli officials also claim Iran launched more attacks after the deal was announced, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=44.52s)]
*  which Iran denies. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=48.84s)]
*  In response, Israel's defense minister said he instructed the military to resume attacks [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  on Iran's capital city. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=55.16s)]
*  At the White House this morning, President Trump accused both sides of endangering their [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=56.72s)]
*  chance for peace. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=60.9s)]
*  We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  don't know what they're doing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  But after speaking directly with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Trump [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=71.88s)]
*  wrote on Truth Social, quote, Israel is not going to attack Iran. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  All planes will turn around and head home, adding, nobody will be hurt. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=80.32s)]
*  The ceasefire is in effect. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=84.52s)]
*  We have CBS News team coverage on this story. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=86.24s)]
*  Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes is at the White House. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  Senior National Security correspondent Charlie Dagata is at the Pentagon. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=91.6s)]
*  And Senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe is following President Trump in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=95.08s)]
*  the Netherlands. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=99.44s)]
*  Nancy, I want to start with you at the White House. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=100.44s)]
*  What more are we learning about the damage assessment from this weekend's strikes on [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=102.41999999999999s)]
*  Iran? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  Tom, according to three sources who have spoken to CBS News, this preliminary assessment, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=107.2s)]
*  which was conducted by the Defense Intelligence Agency, indicates that these nuclear sites [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=112.44s)]
*  that were hit by U.S. bombs and missiles this weekend were severely damaged but were not [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=118.44s)]
*  destroyed, and that it will take anywhere from a few months up to a little less than [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=124.44s)]
*  a year for the Iranians to get back to work. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=130.52s)]
*  According to our sources, the assessment indicates that the bunker-busting bombs did cave in [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=135.28s)]
*  the entrances to the Fordow nuclear facility, but that the actual uranium-enriching infrastructure [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  is buried so far underground that it remains largely intact, and that it's just a matter [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  the Iranians being able to dig out those entrances, restore electricity and water service [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=158.08s)]
*  to the site, and then they can get back to work. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=164.56s)]
*  And this is obviously a crucial development for a couple of reasons. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=168.12s)]
*  First of all, President Trump has been insisting that the nuclear facilities were obliterated, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=172.44s)]
*  and this assessment, according to our sources, would indicate otherwise, although it is important [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=179.0s)]
*  to note this is a preliminary assessment based on signals intelligence, based on satellite [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=184.04s)]
*  imagery, and so things could still change. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=189.76s)]
*  But it is also, Tom, sure to fire up Democrats who already had big questions about the justification [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=194.0s)]
*  that President Trump was using to launch these strikes in the first place. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=201.76s)]
*  They say that the intelligence did not indicate that Iran was as close to producing a nuclear [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=206.32s)]
*  weapon as Trump claimed that the country was. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=211.76s)]
*  And now they're going to have big questions about the claims Trump is making about the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=215.44s)]
*  success of this strike, too. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, one other big question, as you mentioned, Nancy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=221.64s)]
*  What is the president doing to try to keep this fragile ceasefire intact? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=224.56s)]
*  Well, the president railed against both Iran and Israel this morning in an expletive, laided [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=229.88s)]
*  commentary to reporters before he got on Marine One and the Air Force One to head to NATO, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=239.56s)]
*  really threatening them that they needed to both cease firing upon one another immediately [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=246.4s)]
*  to sort of make good on the ceasefire that he claimed he had brokered the night before. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=254.84s)]
*  He now appears to be more positive, says that both sides have called off their final strikes, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=260.12s)]
*  and he now believes that in the future, if this ceasefire holds and the end of the war, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=269.0s)]
*  this 12-day war, as he calls it, is near, that perhaps in the future the U.S. and Iran [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=276.6s)]
*  can even be trading partners and that perhaps in the future the U.S. can be purchasing Iranian [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=282.76s)]
*  oil. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=288.56s)]
*  Certainly a tense situation, something many around the world are watching very closely. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=289.56s)]
*  Nancy Cordes for us at the White House. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=292.76s)]
*  Nancy, thank you. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=294.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=295.6s)]
*  Let's now turn to CBS News senior national security correspondent Charlie Daggett. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  He's at the Pentagon. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=300.44s)]
*  Charlie, good to see you. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=301.44s)]
*  What is the Pentagon saying about the damage done to Iran's nuclear program? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=302.44s)]
*  There's a lot we don't know, right? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=307.44s)]
*  Well, there's a lot we don't know and some that looks like we do know. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=309.04s)]
*  And really, it depends on who you talk to. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=313.36s)]
*  But the official line from the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, not rowing it back, still the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=315.04s)]
*  same as the president, Iran's nuclear program has been completely obliterated. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=319.56s)]
*  Obviously, that appears from the preliminary assessment to be at odds. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=323.44s)]
*  That tells a different story. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=327.4s)]
*  The White House has already pushed back, calling it flat out wrong. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=328.4s)]
*  So we reached out to the defense secretary's office today and we got this statement. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=331.68s)]
*  Based on everything we've seen and I've seen it all, our bombing campaign obliterated [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  Iran's ability to create nuclear weapons. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=341.24s)]
*  Our massive bombs hit exactly the right spot at each target and worked perfectly. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=348.08s)]
*  So anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the president [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=352.2s)]
*  and the successful mission. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=357.76s)]
*  So we'll expect to hear more from that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=359.68s)]
*  And we expect to get that full report, as Nancy said, the full report from the Defense [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  Intelligence Agency in the coming days. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=365.76s)]
*  And we expect also to get some more details as far as exactly how much damage was done [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=368.68s)]
*  there. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  So, Charlie, we heard from Nancy saying that the president had struck a much more optimistic [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  social, about the ceasefire deal between Israel and Iran. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=379.58s)]
*  But can you get us up to speed? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=383.78s)]
*  What's the status of that as we speak? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=384.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, well, Tom, so he was very angry this morning, you know, he's used those expletives [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=386.85999999999996s)]
*  because both sides were firing each other overnight. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=392.06s)]
*  You know, so when he was heading to the summit, he was very angry at what was happening because [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=395.46s)]
*  he believes that both sides violated the ceasefire. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=402.5s)]
*  But tonight, the truce remains intact. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=405.98s)]
*  It appears to be holding, but, you know, it comes after a heavy barrage from both sides, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=410.5s)]
*  because it seemed that both sides had violated it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=415.3s)]
*  And sometimes, you know, I've seen a lot of these ceasefires, and you immediately hear [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=417.72s)]
*  ceasefire violations right after that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=420.66s)]
*  It happens in Ukraine, it happens in Israel against Hamas, and obviously it's happened [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=423.06s)]
*  with Israel against Iran. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=428.1s)]
*  Part of it's because it was kind of vague as far as how it was supposed to be phased [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=429.78000000000003s)]
*  out. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=433.82s)]
*  And it also, believe it or not, it sometimes comes down to time zones. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=434.86s)]
*  You know, what does midnight mean in Israel? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=438.62s)]
*  What's midnight in Iran? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=441.06s)]
*  But there were waves of attacks, attacks that went back and forth, claiming civilian lives, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=442.65999999999997s)]
*  firing missiles into Israel. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=447.74s)]
*  Four civilians were killed there. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=449.38s)]
*  So it's not uncommon for both sides to get their last shots in. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=450.86s)]
*  That always happens. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=453.78s)]
*  But tonight, there's a tenuous ceasefire. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=456.34s)]
*  It appears to be holding. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=459.74s)]
*  It is fragile, but holding for now. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=461.1s)]
*  Tenuous and fragile, indeed. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=463.46s)]
*  I'm Charlie Dagadov reporting for us from the Pentagon. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=464.58s)]
*  Charlie, thank you for that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3Q2TpHK3c&t=466.78s)]
