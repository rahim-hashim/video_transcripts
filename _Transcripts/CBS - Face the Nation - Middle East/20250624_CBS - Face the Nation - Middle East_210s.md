# Expected congressional security briefings on Israel-Iran conflict canceled
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64)
*  Welcome back. Security briefings that were planned for today for members of Congress [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=0.0s)]
*  on the rising tensions between Israel and Iran have now been canceled. Some legislators [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=4.28s)]
*  on both sides, they have called for a vote to reassert Congress's power to declare war [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=9.84s)]
*  after the missile strikes ordered by the White House on Iranian nuclear facilities over the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=15.38s)]
*  weekend. So I want to bring in CBS News congressional reporter Torian Small. Good to see you today, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=19.76s)]
*  Torian. So what's the latest on the hearings and why they were canceled in the first place? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=25.24s)]
*  Yeah, Mugo, just under an hour, Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader for Democrats [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=31.8s)]
*  here in the Senate, had a press conference where he fumed about this postponement of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=38.36s)]
*  this classified briefing, saying that even though the Trump administration is willing [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=44.0s)]
*  to offer up Secretary's Hegseth and another member of the administration to testify later [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=48.72s)]
*  this week, he says it's insufficient. And quite frankly, he said he didn't get an explanation [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=55.8s)]
*  as to why the administration was choosing to delay this briefing. What he's saying, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=61.76s)]
*  though, that this is a clear violation of accountability and won't allow Congress to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=66.56s)]
*  do its oversight. He also talked about how he received the call from the administration [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=73.16s)]
*  when those strikes happened, saying he was insufficiently given information as to why [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=79.32s)]
*  and where this was happening. He's saying it's high time for Congress to act, which [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=85.16s)]
*  is why we saw three Democrats this week put forth a war powers resolution before that, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=90.16s)]
*  a bipartisan resolution by Representative Thomas Massey, a Republican and Ro Khanna, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=95.32s)]
*  a Democrat, including quite a few members of the Progressive Congressional Caucus. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=100.44s)]
*  Thomas Massey has since walked that back, saying that he would reconsider whether or [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=104.6s)]
*  not to move forward with that war powers resolution. But at the same time, we have Republican [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=109.16s)]
*  leadership in both the House and the Senate, saying that it's unnecessary. Senator, Speaker [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=113.64s)]
*  Mike Johnson saying it could potentially be unconstitutional, though, which we hear from [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=118.2s)]
*  Democrats who say that that just isn't the case. Okay, Torian, let's talk interest rates [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=122.84s)]
*  because Fed Chair Jerome Powell testified earlier this morning on Capitol Hill. What [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=128.72s)]
*  did he say about the potential for a rate cut moving forward? Yeah, he said based off [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=132.96s)]
*  of analysis that he's receiving from economists, not just within the Fed, but also outside, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=139.04s)]
*  there are concerns that the economy is heading in the wrong direction and that inflation [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=146.6s)]
*  is likely to tick upwards. And he was putting the blame almost solely on President Donald [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  Trump's terror, saying the impact of that is unknown, but he is taking caution and hesitancy [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=159.52s)]
*  in moving forward, which is why we're not seeing a change in the interest rate just [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=165.44s)]
*  yet. Ahead of his testimony, we heard from President Donald Trump in a true social post [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=169.84s)]
*  calling him, him being Jerome Powell, that is hardheaded and saying that he should consider [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  resigning. This, of course, is a longstanding beef between the two. Jerome Powell didn't [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=181.44s)]
*  necessarily comment on that, but did maintain during this hearing that he believes he's [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=185.92s)]
*  acting in the best interest of the United States economy. Again, he's pointing to inflation [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=191.12s)]
*  that is potentially on the horizon because of these tariffs, these broad and sweeping [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=197.08s)]
*  tariffs that Donald Trump has imposed. All right, Torian Small, thank you so much. We [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=202.2s)]
*  always appreciate seeing you here in 24 seven. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HlNLT6t64&t=207.44s)]
