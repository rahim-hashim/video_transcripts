# Head of UN refugee efforts in Gaza says "number one concern" is clean drinking water
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY)
*  We're going to have to leave it there and turn to one of the crises right now out of the Middle East with the Israel Hamas conflict. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining us is Scott Anderson. He is the director of the UN's refugee efforts in Gaza. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  UNRWA is the largest relief agency for Palestinian refugees, and he joins us right now from Amman, Jordan. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=11.72s)]
*  Scott, I know you were in the U.S. Army. You served two tours in Afghanistan. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=18.92s)]
*  From what you've seen in Gaza, how does it compare? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=24.92s)]
*  Sorry, I cannot hear Scott right now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=30.0s)]
*  Sorry. I was going to say Gaza is much worse, Margaret, than Afghanistan was. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=34.0s)]
*  I mean, everywhere you go, the scale of destruction just really defies description. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=42.0s)]
*  It looks like something out of a post-apocalyptic movie. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=46.0s)]
*  Most places you're looking at 90 to 100 percent destruction, with the infrastructure suffering much worse. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=51.0s)]
*  So I never saw anything quite like that in Afghanistan that we're seeing now in Gaza. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=57.0s)]
*  The USAID chief, Samantha Power, said conditions are worse now in Gaza than ever before. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=62.0s)]
*  She said that was due to the Israeli military operations and closed crossings. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=69.0s)]
*  What exactly is the humanitarian situation right now? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=74.0s)]
*  So what you have is 2.2 million people that have all been displaced at least once. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=79.0s)]
*  Most have been displaced multiple times. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=83.0s)]
*  In Rafa, head of the operation, we had over a million people again displaced to Khan Units, to Derebella. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=86.0s)]
*  And what they're lacking is really just basic necessities that we all kind of expect. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=93.0s)]
*  They need food, they need access to water, they need access to showers, access to toilets, access to medical care. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=96.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, because of a variety of factors, we're unable to import everything that's needed [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=102.0s)]
*  to make sure that everybody has the basic necessities that they need to get through every day. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=109.0s)]
*  Nineteen different aid organizations released a letter this week saying Palestinians are surviving on less than 3 percent of their daily water needs. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=114.0s)]
*  Hepatitis is spreading. Medical evacuations have been halted. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=122.0s)]
*  Virtually every hospital has been issued evacuation orders. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=127.0s)]
*  The Pentagon said it has suspended air drops of food because of the Israeli military action. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=131.0s)]
*  We know the pier is not really operating. Who exactly is impeding the delivery? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=137.0s)]
*  I think it's a variety of things, not just one person that you can point to. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=142.0s)]
*  The bulk of our aid comes in through Karim Shalom. It all comes through Egypt, starts at Port Said, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=148.0s)]
*  goes through the Sinai to Al-Arish, and eventually makes its way to Karim Shalom where it's brought in then by us [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=154.0s)]
*  to the Palestinian side and then onward for the last mile distribution within Gaza. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=160.0s)]
*  There's a lot of steps that have to go perfectly right for all that to work. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=165.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, not everything has gone right. For a time, Egypt was not sending trucks. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=169.0s)]
*  We had 80,000 metric tons of aid in country we couldn't access. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=174.0s)]
*  We've been perpetually playing catch-up on the aid situation since October. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=180.0s)]
*  Not everybody has a tent that needs one, so you have people sleeping outside still as we're eight months after the start of the conflict. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=186.0s)]
*  You highlighted correctly our number one concern at this point, which is access to clean drinking water. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=193.0s)]
*  Without that, in addition to hepatitis, you have things like cholera and other diseases that can become very prevalent. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=198.0s)]
*  We could see an outbreak happen very soon. It's something that concerns us. Additionally, it's getting hot. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=203.0s)]
*  It's summer. Essentially, you're in a desert. If people don't have access to clean drinking water, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=209.0s)]
*  that's a problem for dehydration as well as for disease. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=214.0s)]
*  I know you are with the UN, so you can't talk about politics and policy, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=218.0s)]
*  but President Biden did make this address Friday talking about a proposal for a ceasefire and hostage deal. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=223.0s)]
*  He said it would come with 600 aid trucks per day to enter Gaza with supplies, with shelter and the like. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=231.0s)]
*  Who's going to be doing all of that distribution? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=240.0s)]
*  I mean, it would be the entire international humanitarian community because of the scale. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=244.0s)]
*  Currently, UNRWA feeds a little over half the population. We're feeding about 1.3 or 1.4 million people every day. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=248.0s)]
*  But it would be us along with the rest of the UN and all our partners. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=256.0s)]
*  I would say we very much welcome a ceasefire. It's time for the hostages to go home to their families. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=259.0s)]
*  Time for more aid to start coming in, and then hopefully we can start rebuilding Gaza. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=264.0s)]
*  Scott Anderson, thank you for telling us what you are seeing and experiencing on the ground. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7MC9YsupWY&t=269.0s)]
