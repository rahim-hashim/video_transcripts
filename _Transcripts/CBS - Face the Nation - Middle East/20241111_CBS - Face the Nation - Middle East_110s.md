# Israel works to increase aid into Gaza as U.S. deadline nears
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [November 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k)
*  Palestinian health officials say at least 40 Palestinians in Gaza were killed Sunday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=0.0s)]
*  in multiple Israeli strikes. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=5.2s)]
*  One of those strikes damaged a three-story building in the northern part of Gaza. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=7.36s)]
*  Israel claims terrorists were operating in the area and posed a threat to Israeli troops. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=11.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel faces a Wednesday deadline to comply with the Biden administration's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=16.12s)]
*  deadline to increase aid to Gaza or face restrictions on American military support. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=20.52s)]
*  CBS News' senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer is at the Israel-Gaza border, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=25.88s)]
*  where some aid trucks are passing through. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=30.0s)]
*  Behind me you can see food aid in Israel ready to be driven into Gaza. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=32.12s)]
*  There's wheat flour to make bread. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=38.44s)]
*  We've got blankets, toilet paper, essentials. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=41.48s)]
*  It's a cumbersome business because the trucks will have to drive through the heavily guarded border, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=44.96s)]
*  unload and then have Palestinian trucks pick it up, reload it and distribute it further inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=50.68s)]
*  Today, about 150 trucks are going to cross into Gaza through four crossings. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=60.6s)]
*  Under pressure from the Americans, the amount of aid is slowly increasing from a low in October of about 30 trucks a day. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=67.64s)]
*  We're up to 150. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=76.36s)]
*  A new crossing is supposed to open, says Israel, although they haven't told us when. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=78.36s)]
*  But that's still 200 trucks short of the American target of 300 trucks a day. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  And in a letter, the U.S. has warned that if Israel doesn't meet that aid target, it risks losing defense assistance. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=91.28s)]
*  It will face a reduction in the amount of military aid coming in that allows it to continue to fight this war. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=100.08s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=107.44s)]
*  Elizabeth Palmer, thank you. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqCQyD1f3k&t=108.44s)]
