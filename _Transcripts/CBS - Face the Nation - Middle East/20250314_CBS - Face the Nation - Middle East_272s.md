# Hamas agrees to release U.S.-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg)
*  We begin with some breaking news out of the Middle East this morning where Hamas is saying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=0.0s)]
*  that they're agreeing to release living American Israeli hostage, Eden Alexander, as well as [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  the bodies of four other deceased hostages. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=9.28s)]
*  I want to get right to CBS News foreign correspondent Rami Nissencio, who's in Tel Aviv with the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=11.6s)]
*  late breaking details. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=16.36s)]
*  So Rami, what can you tell us? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=17.44s)]
*  Vlad, good to see you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=19.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=22.04s)]
*  And a reminder that Eden Alexander is believed to be the last living American hostage that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=23.04s)]
*  Hamas is holding. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=26.96s)]
*  Case 21 from New Jersey and joined the Israeli military as a dual citizen. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=28.32s)]
*  As for the remains of the four dead hostages that Hamas says that it could release, they're [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=32.52s)]
*  referred to by Hamas as having dual citizenship as well, but their identities so far haven't [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  been made public. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=40.88s)]
*  And Hamas is saying that all this is in response to a proposal from mediators yesterday to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=42.7s)]
*  restart negotiations. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=48.16s)]
*  They said that they responded positively and that they want to hammer out an agreement [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=49.96s)]
*  looking ahead to a second phase to end this war. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=53.36s)]
*  In that statement, they haven't given any demands, but we might expect they'll ask for [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=57.32s)]
*  the release of more Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=61.8s)]
*  So far about 2,000 had been released in the first phase. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=64.72s)]
*  Also the resumption of aid into Gaza. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=67.56s)]
*  We're now in day 14 of aid and medical supplies not going into the Strip and possibly, just [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  possibly Vlad, holding Israel to withdrawing from Gaza, which was in the original framework. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=74.2s)]
*  So Rami, does this mark a potential breakthrough in talks to continue to continue with that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=79.17999999999999s)]
*  ceasefire, which is what most people are hoping can happen just as long as all the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=86.12s)]
*  hostages eventually come home? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=92.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think you have to look at it from the different sides here. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=95.04s)]
*  If you look at it from Hamas's point of view, it actually might appear that way from what [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=99.28s)]
*  they've just said from that statement. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=103.72s)]
*  But Israel and Hamas might actually be talking about two different proposals or at least [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=105.4s)]
*  maybe variations in proposals. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  That's because the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu here said that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=113.48s)]
*  Israel has accepted a proposal. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=116.44s)]
*  That proposal is from Steve Witkoff and that calls for the release of five living hostages, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  nine dead hostages and then a 50 day extension of that ceasefire. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=123.44s)]
*  But Hamas just may be agreeing to a different proposal from Adam Bueller and that's Trump's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  hostage envoy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=133.04s)]
*  He met directly with Hamas last week and they specifically talked about first releasing [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  then releasing the other Israeli hostages later on. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=140.0s)]
*  And an Israeli official just told CBS News in the past few minutes that Hamas is trying [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=143.64s)]
*  to, in his words, sabotage talks by focusing solely on the Americans. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=147.96s)]
*  We might get more clarity tomorrow night. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=152.96s)]
*  That's when Netanyahu and his ministers are supposed to meet to go over the report from [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=155.52s)]
*  the negotiating team from Doha and we're told they're going to be flying back here tonight. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=160.08s)]
*  All right, Remy, before you go, let me ask you about what the Associated Press is reporting, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=163.68s)]
*  which is that the United States and Israel have been in contact with officials from East [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=167.68s)]
*  Africa. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=171.36s)]
*  It doesn't specify what East African country, but about possible locations to resettle Palestinians [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=172.36s)]
*  from Gaza. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=179.42000000000002s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=182.08s)]
*  Well, first off, CBS News has actually reached out to the prime minister's office here along [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  with the foreign minister's office. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  Both have told us they have nothing to say about that report coming from the Associated [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  Press. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=196.12s)]
*  But out of those three countries, they have been named. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  Sudan reportedly confirmed that the U.S. has reached out and Sudanese officials, they have [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=201.44s)]
*  reportedly said that they don't want anyone from Gaza. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=206.36s)]
*  They've said no. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=209.76s)]
*  Sudan does have diplomatic ties with Israel, though, normalized during Trump's first term. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=211.12s)]
*  So there's potentially some leverage there that they're trying to do. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=216.34s)]
*  But the country we know has been in nearly two years into a bloody civil war. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=219.44s)]
*  millions of people have fled the country. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=225.8s)]
*  As for the other two regions, one is Somalia. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=228.16000000000003s)]
*  The other is Somaliland, which broke away from Somalia about 35 years ago. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=231.84s)]
*  Officials there reportedly said that they are not aware of any U.S. outreach, but U.S. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=238.54000000000002s)]
*  and Israeli officials say that they have. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=243.08s)]
*  But going back to the point of whether they, Gazans would want to voluntarily go, Somalia [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  is one of the poorest countries in Africa, not even the world. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=250.54s)]
*  Somaliland just a little bit better, but not that far behind. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=253.98s)]
*  Yeah, this is an absolutely bizarre story. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=257.34s)]
*  And I can't understand if it turns out to even be remotely true why that would be where [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=260.78s)]
*  you would want to resettle. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=266.58s)]
*  All right, Ramin, thank you very much, my friend. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=267.58s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL5WyhN1zg&t=270.7s)]
