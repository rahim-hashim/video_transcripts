# Israel-Iran ceasefire on shaky ground as Trump heads to NATO summit
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU)
*  But now to the Netherlands, keeping a close eye there as President Donald Trump is expected [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=0.0s)]
*  to be wheels down any moment now for a NATO summit. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=5.36s)]
*  His visit comes during a crucial ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=8.8s)]
*  The message from the president on that is this. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  The ceasefire is now in effect. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=16.76s)]
*  It appears to be holding after it seemed to stall just hours after the president announced [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=18.84s)]
*  the deal. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=24.16s)]
*  So let's break down what Israel says happened. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=25.16s)]
*  Shortly before the ceasefire went into effect, they say Iran launched a barrage of missiles [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=27.48s)]
*  in the southern city of Beersheba, killing four people and wounding about 20 others. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=32.92s)]
*  After the ceasefire officially started, they say Iran unloaded another set of missiles, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  putting them in clear violation of the agreement. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=43.96s)]
*  In response to that, Israel then retaliated by destroying a radar array near Tehran. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=47.32s)]
*  Iran denies any violation. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=52.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, here in the U.S., President Trump was quick to save the deal after a conversation [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=55.16s)]
*  with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=60.16s)]
*  After that direct conversation, Netanyahu says Israel refrained from further attacks. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=63.32s)]
*  Prior to that call, though, the president expressed his frustration. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=68.68s)]
*  Listen. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=72.64s)]
*  I think they both violated it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=73.64s)]
*  I don't think they, I'm not sure they did it intentionally. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  They couldn't rein people back. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=79.08s)]
*  I don't like the fact that Israel went out this morning at all. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=80.8s)]
*  And I'm going to see if I can stop it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=84.0s)]
*  Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  the likes of which I'd never seen before. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=89.92s)]
*  The biggest load that we've seen. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=92.24s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=94.0s)]
*  You know, when I say, OK, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=95.84s)]
*  and just drop everything you have on them. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=100.44s)]
*  So I'm not happy with them. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=102.32s)]
*  I'm not happy with Iran either. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=103.96s)]
*  We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=105.88s)]
*  don't know what the f*** they're doing. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=111.4s)]
*  Do you understand that? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=113.32s)]
*  We have got team coverage. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=115.72s)]
*  Standing by for us over in Washington, D.C. is CBS News Chief White House correspondent [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=117.24s)]
*  Nancy Cordes. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=122.88s)]
*  But first, let's go live to the ground in Iraq where we find CBS News senior foreign [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=123.88s)]
*  correspondent Holly Williams. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  Holly, thanks for your time once again today. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=129.92s)]
*  Given the back and forth that we've seen today, is this ceasefire actually guaranteed to hold? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  Hey there, Mugo. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=140.4s)]
*  No, I don't think it's guaranteed at all. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=141.4s)]
*  In fact, it looks fairly precarious, doesn't it? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  You have Israel alleging ceasefire violations and then retaliating. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=145.12s)]
*  Iran denying those ceasefire violations. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  Some very harsh language from President Trump there for both sides. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=151.96s)]
*  It is clearly very fragile, but there's also enormous pressure being exerted by the U.S. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  to try to make it stick. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  And then there have been a lot of headlines coming from the region just over the weekend. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=164.0s)]
*  So much has happened. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=168.76s)]
*  Can you walk us through the biggest developments and also explain how we got here? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=169.88s)]
*  Yeah, Mugo, it's been a complex time in the Middle East and this is a complex part of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=174.6s)]
*  the world. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=180.96s)]
*  The U.S. entered the conflict over the weekend by bombing three Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=181.96s)]
*  Iran clearly felt compelled to respond, perhaps because to do otherwise in this region would [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=188.44s)]
*  look weak. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=193.92s)]
*  But the fact is that Iran is weakened by 11 days of war with Israel. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=194.92s)]
*  And when the response came, it was actually fairly minimal. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=199.64s)]
*  President Trump said that Iran fired 14 missiles at the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  That's the biggest U.S. military base here in the Middle East with several thousand American [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=208.48s)]
*  troops. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=212.88s)]
*  He said 13 of those missiles were intercepted, shot down, and one was allowed to land harmlessly. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=213.88s)]
*  He also said that Iran had given advance warning. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=218.73999999999998s)]
*  Now that looks like a kind of face saving or even performative retaliation. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=222.48s)]
*  And then shortly afterwards, Iran agreed to a ceasefire. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=227.32s)]
*  And Holly, in light of all this, it's important to ask what comes next? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=231.04s)]
*  Where do we go from here? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=235.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, clearly diplomatic wheels are turning. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=237.08s)]
*  But what are the possibilities here? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  Firstly, yeah, the ceasefire could break down and then we return to war between Iran and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=243.32s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=247.4s)]
*  If the ceasefire holds, I guess there are a few possibilities. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=248.4s)]
*  One, I guess Iran could kind of capitulate and give up its nuclear program or at least [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=250.48s)]
*  curtail it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=254.88s)]
*  That's pretty clearly what President Trump is hoping for. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=255.88s)]
*  On the other hand, the Iranians could look at the last few days being attacked by Israel, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=258.4s)]
*  bombed by the U.S. and take from that that they need to better defend their country and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=263.2s)]
*  think to themselves, well, actually, we're now more motivated to produce nuclear weapons. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=267.44s)]
*  And of course, Mugo, they could do both. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=271.52s)]
*  They could publicly pursue a diplomatic solution and secretly try to rebuild their nuclear [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=273.28s)]
*  program. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=278.44s)]
*  A nuclear program, by the way, that they've always maintained is only for civilian purposes. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=279.44s)]
*  Of course, time will tell. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=285.32s)]
*  CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams live for us in Iraq. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=286.84s)]
*  Thank you once again for your time today. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=290.64s)]
*  Now over to the White House and CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=293.14s)]
*  Nancy, thank you for your time. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=297.52s)]
*  We know the pressure is on from the president. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=298.84s)]
*  He's calling out both Israel and Iran. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=301.6s)]
*  What else did he have to say today? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=304.0s)]
*  Well, Mugo, after that initial expression of anger this morning at both Iran and Israel, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=306.28s)]
*  the president is now expressing optimism that a ceasefire has taken hold and is going [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=312.88s)]
*  to remain in place and that this war between Israel and Iran is, in fact, going to end. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=319.0s)]
*  He added that Iran will not be able to reinitiate its nuclear program, but he expressed hope [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=325.68s)]
*  that Iran would be able to become a great trading nation, in his words, even said that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=334.68s)]
*  perhaps in the future countries like the U.S. would be purchasing oil from Iran once again. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  Nancy, all of that considered, the president also sounded off today on the possibility [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  of more Iranian retaliation after the U.S. attacked multiple nuclear sites over the weekend. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  So what was his message there? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=358.91999999999996s)]
*  He said that basically Iran, in his words, needed to get it out of its system. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=362.4s)]
*  In other words, after the U.S. mounted this massive attack on Iranian nuclear sites over [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=367.92s)]
*  the weekend, Iran had to do something in response. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=374.92s)]
*  But it turned out to be, as Holly just described, more of a face-saving measure. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=379.8s)]
*  The Iranians gave plenty of notice in advance that this was going to happen, so the Qataris [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  and the Americans were ready for it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=389.71999999999997s)]
*  They fired off about a dozen missiles that the U.S. was easily able to intercept and [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=394.32s)]
*  there were no casualties. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=400.32s)]
*  So basically the president said he was glad that Iran had given the U.S. a heads up and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=402.76s)]
*  that he hopes that now the two sides can pursue peace and said he doesn't anticipate any further [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=408.88s)]
*  military action by the U.S., especially if the ceasefire holds. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=415.08s)]
*  And Nancy, we know the president is meeting face-to-face with European allies today. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=420.32s)]
*  There's still a lot of conflicts out there that have not been resolved just yet. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  So what exactly is his goal there? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=427.96s)]
*  Right, I mean, with all the attention focused on the Middle East, we really haven't been [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=430.28s)]
*  talking as much about the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the flailing attempts [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=435.15999999999997s)]
*  to engineer some sort of ceasefire there. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=442.23999999999995s)]
*  To the contrary, Russia is really pounding the Ukrainian border and that is what a lot [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=446.72s)]
*  of these NATO leaders want to talk about in the Hague, in the Netherlands. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=450.76000000000005s)]
*  And so President Trump said as he was heading there today that he's going to switch gears [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=456.48s)]
*  and try to solve a lot of other problems. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=460.78000000000003s)]
*  And of course this is something that's of great concern to leaders from Europe because [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=464.16s)]
*  this is right there on their borders. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=468.72s)]
*  And so that's going to be an upward discussion. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=472.0s)]
*  But remember that there are a lot of European leaders who are much more firmly in the Ukrainian [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=475.92s)]
*  camp than the president tends to be. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=481.4s)]
*  So we'll see whether they're able to make any headway on that issue over the next 24 hours. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=483.96s)]
*  We shall wait and see. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=489.32s)]
*  Nancy Kord is at the White House for us. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=490.32s)]
*  Thank you for your time today. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=492.16s)]
*  I know we'll come back to you shortly because just minutes ago we got a gaggle of the president [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=493.64s)]
*  on Air Force One taking questions from reporters. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=500.0s)]
*  So let's listen to what he had to say. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=502.59999999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much everybody. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=507.35999999999996s)]
*  I'll see you. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=508.35999999999996s)]
*  The Iranian sleeper cells in the United States. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=509.35999999999996s)]
*  Biden led a lot of supersus. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=511.35999999999996s)]
*  Biden was an incompetent president and had no idea what he was doing. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=514.24s)]
*  He hardly ever signed a document. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=517.88s)]
*  Other people signed documents for him with the auto pen. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=520.4s)]
*  It was gross incompetence. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=523.52s)]
*  And among everything else, he led a lot of super cells in. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=525.9599999999999s)]
*  Many from Iran. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=529.0s)]
*  But hopefully we'll take care of them. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=531.4799999999999s)]
*  What Biden did to this country should never be forgotten. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=533.68s)]
*  Do you think you'll get the Nobel Peace Prize now? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  All right so Nancy, he didn't really say much at that moment there in that conversation [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=540.92s)]
*  with reporters because he didn't take a lot of questions. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=545.4799999999999s)]
*  But did anything stand out to you from his comments? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=547.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=550.4s)]
*  So he was asked about the possibility that Iran could retaliate further, not just on [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=551.4s)]
*  a U.S. military base the way that we saw yesterday, but perhaps with would-be terrorists or sleeper [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=557.36s)]
*  cells here in the United States. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=565.64s)]
*  And he went on to say a couple of things in response that aren't substantiated. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=567.36s)]
*  First of all, he said that his predecessor, President Biden, had led in a lot of Iranian [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=572.08s)]
*  sleeper cells. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=577.76s)]
*  There's no evidence that that is the case. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=579.92s)]
*  And then he said that Biden let his staffers sign a whole bunch of things with an auto [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=581.76s)]
*  pen. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=586.6s)]
*  Again, not much evidence of that either. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=587.6s)]
*  But nevertheless, this is a president who tends to criticize his predecessor when he [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=591.4s)]
*  has the opportunity. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=596.08s)]
*  And that's what he was doing on Air Force One as well. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=597.88s)]
*  I can tell you more broadly that because of the way that things have played out over the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=600.12s)]
*  past 24, 48 hours, it does appear that Homeland Security officials are a little bit less concerned [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=604.48s)]
*  now. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=610.88s)]
*  And I think that there will be some kind of sleeper cell here in the United States that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=612.28s)]
*  is activated, especially after that Iranian response that appeared aimed at ratcheting [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=614.52s)]
*  down the tension with the U.S. and not building it up. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=621.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=624.48s)]
*  CBS News Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes, as always, we appreciate your reporting [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=625.48s)]
*  and your insight. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=629.48s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbPP8aE0frU&t=630.48s)]
