Video Description: Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose son is being held hostage by Hamas, tells "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" that negotiating with them is like "dealing with Satan." But, he added," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "has made choices to pursue this fantasy of total victory over Hamas, a terrorist organization, and no doubt, but this idea of total victory is a messianic one from his coalition partners, and not realistic."

# Father of Israeli-American hostage says negotiating with Hamas is "dealing with Satan"
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI)
*  We are joined now by Jonathan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=0.0s)]
*  Dekelkhen, the father of one of [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=2.2s)]
*  the Israeli-American hostages [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=4.34s)]
*  still being held by Hamas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=5.94s)]
*  He joins us from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=7.9s)]
*  Jonathan, thank you so much for [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=9.9s)]
*  being with us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=11.8s)]
*  I can only imagine what a [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=12.38s)]
*  difficult night it has been for [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=13.68s)]
*  your family, for all of the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=15.98s)]
*  families of the hostages. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=17.44s)]
*  Have you been able to connect [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=19.34s)]
*  with the Goldberg-Polans or any [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=21.52s)]
*  of the families who lost their [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=23.32s)]
*  loved ones? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=24.66s)]
*  Yes, I have corresponded with [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=28.04s)]
*  them over the course of the last [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=30.28s)]
*  few hours, expressing [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=33.28s)]
*  condolences. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=35.42s)]
*  We are all absolutely horrified [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=36.72s)]
*  by the needless, senseless death [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=38.76s)]
*  of these six beautiful young [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=41.3s)]
*  people. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=42.82s)]
*  What, if anything, have you been [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=44.0s)]
*  told by the Israeli government [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=45.6s)]
*  about how these six individuals [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=47.260000000000005s)]
*  died and when they died? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=49.44s)]
*  Hamas is saying that they were [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=51.54s)]
*  killed by Israeli bullets. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=53.5s)]
*  Do you believe that? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=55.3s)]
*  Yes, we know what we know from [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=58.980000000000004s)]
*  the media, actually, and from [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=62.940000000000005s)]
*  some statements from our [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=64.58s)]
*  military. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=67.22s)]
*  They died very shortly before [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  they were found by IDF troops. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=70.86s)]
*  All of them were certainly [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=75.12s)]
*  living in a state of deprivation [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=78.54s)]
*  for many, many months. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=81.06s)]
*  But in the end, as your reporter [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=82.26s)]
*  said, they were executed by [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=84.28s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  And the same is true evidently [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=87.2s)]
*  of six other bodies of Israeli [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=89.36s)]
*  hostages who returned the week [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=92.0s)]
*  before, four of them from [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=94.16s)]
*  Maikybutz. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=96.2s)]
*  And those were older men, in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=97.4s)]
*  this case this week, younger [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=100.5s)]
*  people, but all of them alive [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=103.32s)]
*  for months in Hamas captivity. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=105.88s)]
*  So time is absolutely working [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=107.92s)]
*  against us and, quite honestly, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=110.38s)]
*  against the people of Gaza as [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  well. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=113.38s)]
*  Well, you heard Imtiaz report [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=114.22s)]
*  that several of the hostages [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=115.94s)]
*  who were killed were next in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=118.58s)]
*  line to be released if there [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=119.98s)]
*  were to be a ceasefire. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=121.92s)]
*  Who do you hold responsible for [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=123.02s)]
*  the fact that there is still no [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=125.26s)]
*  ceasefire today? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=127.56s)]
*  Well, the situation exists [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=130.5s)]
*  because Hamas, on October 7th, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=132.5s)]
*  invaded Israel, killed nearly [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=134.7s)]
*  1,400 people, committed mass [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=136.6s)]
*  rape, mass looting, destroyed [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=139.1s)]
*  homes and property, and has [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=142.28s)]
*  refused since October 7th [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=143.98s)]
*  to return all of the hostages. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  Now that being said, given that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  we're dealing with Satan, I mean [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=149.66s)]
*  that's sort of the launching [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=150.96s)]
*  point for any discussion, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=152.24s)]
*  Israelis at large, and myself [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=155.5s)]
*  included, have been extremely [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=157.70000000000002s)]
*  critical of the Israeli [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=159.78s)]
*  government for not negotiating [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=161.38s)]
*  in good faith now for many, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=164.74s)]
*  many months. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=166.18s)]
*  There is no explanation, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  a reasonable explanation, why [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=170.08s)]
*  our government is refusing to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=172.08s)]
*  deeply engage in these [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=175.34s)]
*  negotiations and complete them [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=176.54s)]
*  when our entire senior military [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=178.64s)]
*  establishment and intelligence [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=180.78s)]
*  community has been saying [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=182.34s)]
*  publicly and openly for weeks [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=183.78s)]
*  and months that the time has [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=186.48s)]
*  come to end the fighting in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WXYL1bIGHI&t=188.57999999999998s)]
