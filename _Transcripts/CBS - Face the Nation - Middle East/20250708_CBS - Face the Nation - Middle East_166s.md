# House Speaker Mike Johnson and Israeli's Netanyahu meet
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is meeting with House Speaker Mike Johnson this morning on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=0.0s)]
*  It's his first trip since the short-lived conflict between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=6.0s)]
*  The two did not take any questions from reporters prior to the meeting. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=10.0s)]
*  But I want to bring in CBS News congressional correspondent Nicole Kellyan. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=14.0s)]
*  Nicole, what are some of the major points the two sides are heading on during today's meeting? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=18.0s)]
*  Well, obviously this is a bit of a courtesy call for the Prime Minister as he spends the next couple of days here in Washington. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=24.0s)]
*  Of course, he has a pretty strong relationship with Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=31.0s)]
*  In fact, the speaker was due to go over to Israel to address the Knesset, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=35.0s)]
*  but had to dial back on that trip in the wake of this conflict at the time between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=40.0s)]
*  But that being said, as you mentioned, there are a lot of developments in that region that remain top of mind for many lawmakers, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=47.0s)]
*  most notably that conflict the U.S. strikes against Iran and also, of course, the future of Gaza, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=54.0s)]
*  which was a topic of discussion when the Prime Minister visited with the president just yesterday [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=61.0s)]
*  in light of hoping to get some of these ceasefire negotiations back on track. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=66.0s)]
*  So all of that likely to potentially be on the agenda as the speaker meets with the Prime Minister. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=71.0s)]
*  Also worth noting that the Prime Minister is said to meet with a bipartisan group of senators as well later this afternoon. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=77.0s)]
*  Yeah, Nicole, that was going to be my next question. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=83.0s)]
*  Do we know what we're expecting out of that? Why he's even making the effort to meet with them? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=85.0s)]
*  Well, obviously, anytime you have a world leader here in Washington, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=90.0s)]
*  it's not uncommon or unusual for them to visit with members of Congress during their time here. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=95.0s)]
*  So that is pretty much what we are witnessing occur. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=102.0s)]
*  But obviously, you know, what is notable again is that this comes on the heels of those U.S. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=105.0s)]
*  strikes against Iran in the wake of the conflict between Israel and Iran. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=111.0s)]
*  And as we had been reporting on for some time now and even in that moment, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=115.0s)]
*  there was certainly a lot of controversy about the U.S. taking action with certainly many Republicans [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=120.0s)]
*  defending the president's decision to move forward with those strikes while many Democrats [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=125.0s)]
*  remain critical, feeling that the president circumvented Congress. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=130.0s)]
*  And in some cases, some Republicans felt that way as well. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=134.0s)]
*  So this is really kind of there. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=137.0s)]
*  And there were a lot of questions, too, about the intelligence with respect to Iran's nuclear program. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=139.0s)]
*  So this will provide an opportunity for some lawmakers to hopefully do a deeper dive or get a better understanding [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=144.0s)]
*  from the prime minister's perspective. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=150.0s)]
*  But again, you know, usually when you have any foreign leader here in town, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=152.0s)]
*  Congress and the president, of course, like to roll out the red carpet. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=157.0s)]
*  That is very true. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=161.0s)]
*  Nicole Killian on Capitol Hill for us today. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=162.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea8voWFYu2U&t=164.0s)]
