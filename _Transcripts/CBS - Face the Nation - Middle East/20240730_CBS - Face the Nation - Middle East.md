# Israel strikes Beirut, targeting Hezbollah commander after Golan Heights attack
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI)
*  First, we are following breaking news out of Lebanon with the Israeli military says [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=0.0s)]
*  it has carried out a strike targeting the Hezbollah commander allegedly behind Saturday's deadly [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=5.48s)]
*  attack in the Golan Heights. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=10.42s)]
*  For more, let's bring in CBS News contributor Andrew Boyd. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=11.9s)]
*  He's the former chief of operations at the CIA's Counterterrorism Mission Center. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=15.24s)]
*  Andrew, I feel like we hear rockets being launched. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=20.2s)]
*  It's been sort of a tit for tat. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=23.38s)]
*  Is this an escalation? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=24.66s)]
*  Good afternoon, Lindsay. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=26.46s)]
*  It could be an escalation, but really it's a retaliation for the Hezbollah attack, alleged [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=29.28s)]
*  Hezbollah attack against Majed al-Shamz in the Golan Heights over the weekend that resulted [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=34.08s)]
*  in the deaths of 12 Druze children and then repeated rocket attacks from Hezbollah. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=38.72s)]
*  So really a retaliation more than an escalation. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  The concerns are, and they were allegedly targeting Fahd Shukr, who is a senior military [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=47.92s)]
*  advisor, senior military commander under Hassan Nasrallah, the head of the secretary general [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  at Hezbollah. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=58.56s)]
*  If in fact that targeting did not succeed and they did not kill Fahd Shukr, I believe [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=59.56s)]
*  the IDF will continue their attacks against Hezbollah, which then may lead to an escalation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=65.04s)]
*  I know you said this was retaliation, but if we can put up the map again, most of the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=72.56s)]
*  fighting between Arambak-Hezbollah fighters and the IDF have been taking place at the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=76.12s)]
*  border, the northern border between Israel and Lebanon. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=81.4s)]
*  So the southern Lebanese border, we're talking about Beirut here, a very, very populous city. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=85.44s)]
*  That is true. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=93.52s)]
*  But the attack again happened in Beirut's southern suburbs in a neighborhood called [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  Barat Harig, which is Hezbollah's headquarters, and it was targeted against Hezbollah leadership. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=99.4s)]
*  Fahd Shukr was allegedly responsible for the attack in the Golan Heights over the weekend. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=106.8s)]
*  He was also responsible for a great deal of other things. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=114.04s)]
*  He's on the U.S. wanted list. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=116.68s)]
*  There's a $5 million reward out for him for his involvement in the 1983 bombings against [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  our own troops and our own embassies in Beirut, as well as him being in charge of the missile [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=123.4s)]
*  and rocket programs for Hezbollah, but more importantly being the number one military [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=128.84s)]
*  adviser to Hassan Nasrallah, the general secretary of Hezbollah. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  I think the big difference this past weekend was an attack that killed 12 children between [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  the ages of 12 and 16, as I understand it, drew children in the Golan Heights. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=143.2s)]
*  Again, not Jewish citizens of Israel, non-Jewish citizens of Israel, which the Israelis, Prime [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu, feel as much of an obligation to defend as the Jewish population in Israel. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=156.04s)]
*  Now, the United States posture has been that Israel has a right to defend itself, but many [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=162.6s)]
*  leaders have said that more needs to be done to protect civilian life. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  Now, we haven't heard yet from U.S. leadership. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=172.92s)]
*  We know that Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin are overseas right now on an Asia trip. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=176.76s)]
*  How do you imagine the United States will view this? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=182.16s)]
*  Israel does have a right to protect itself, and I do think that the overwhelming dialogue [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=186.2s)]
*  on defending civilians has been centered around the conflict in Gaza, and that is obviously [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=191.0s)]
*  an issue that we've been dealing with internationally for several months. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=195.32s)]
*  Israel also has an obligation to protect civilian lives in the city of Beirut, but again, I [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=201.32s)]
*  don't know if that is going to be an issue with this particular strike in South Beirut. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=207.72s)]
*  We will have to see how that shakes out, whether there are civilian deaths or whether it was [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=213.16s)]
*  really just targeted against members of Hezbollah, Fawad Shukr himself, and then any of the Hezbollah [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=217.88s)]
*  members who are around him. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=222.56s)]
*  Many U.S. leaders have been fearing what could be considered an all-out war between Israel [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  and Hezbollah. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=230.64s)]
*  Why is that, and what other parties could potentially be drawn in if we do find ourselves, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=232.04s)]
*  in fact, in that state? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=238.28s)]
*  Because of the proximity of Hezbollah to Iran, there's a great deal of concern that this [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=241.2s)]
*  will be an escalation, and the capabilities of the Hezbollah military arms, their rocket [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=245.95999999999998s)]
*  forces, their missile forces, their ground forces, could result in tip-for-tap retaliation [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=251.44s)]
*  that obligates the Israeli military to eliminate Hezbollah once and for all. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=257.52s)]
*  There's been a lot of discussion that Prime Minister Netanyahu is unique in his desire [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=263.32s)]
*  to escalate this with Hezbollah. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=268.52s)]
*  I honestly think any Israeli leader would be under the same pressure, because the Israelis, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  a number of Israelis, upwards of 200,000 Israelis, have had to evacuate certain zones because [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=276.08s)]
*  they couldn't be too close to Lebanon due to Hezbollah, and they can't be too close [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  to Gaza because of the Hamas attacks. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=285.76s)]
*  I think the overwhelming majority of Israeli citizens are sick of that, and they want these [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=287.96s)]
*  threats to be eliminated. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=292.56s)]
*  Did I hear you say an elimination of Hezbollah as well? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=295.0s)]
*  I know we have been reporting that the Israeli goal is to defeat Hamas. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=297.44s)]
*  Hezbollah was considered and is considered a more formidable opponent. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=302.0s)]
*  I would argue that there's a number of Israeli citizens, a plurality, if not a majority, who [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=306.68s)]
*  no longer want their homes threatened by Hezbollah. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=311.64s)]
*  Whether that means an all-out elimination of Hezbollah, I don't think we're there yet, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  but they want that threat to be eliminated. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=320.36s)]
*  If that can be achieved by diplomatic means and a pullback of Hezbollah north of the Latani [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=322.64s)]
*  River, which was 12 miles north of the Israeli border, which was a previous agreement, I [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=328.32s)]
*  think the Israeli citizenry will be satisfied with that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  I think most Israelis are sick of being threatened by their neighbors. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=341.20000000000005s)]
*  But that said, is he facing pressure at home to see an end to hostilities? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=344.48s)]
*  I think in the Gaza context, Prime Minister Netanyahu is feeling a great deal of pressure [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=350.0s)]
*  to get the hostages home and to find a way to have a truce to make that happen. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=354.46000000000004s)]
*  Hezbollah is unfortunately tied to that issue, and Hezbollah has said they will continue [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=360.32000000000005s)]
*  pressure on Israel until there is a truce in Gaza with Hamas. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=365.40000000000003s)]
*  So the two things, unfortunately, are connected. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=368.96s)]
*  To date, the Israelis have not come to an accord or a truce with Hamas. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=372.59999999999997s)]
*  So I do think this will continue apace with the hopes that it won't escalate into a full [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=378.79999999999995s)]
*  regional war, Iran, Hezbollah, Israel. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=384.88s)]
*  And inevitably, the United States will support our Israeli allies in one way or another. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=389.12s)]
*  Andrew Boyd, thank you so much for joining us on this breaking news. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=395.2s)]
*  Appreciate your time. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=397.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Lindsay. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UaZkqF5ucI&t=398.96s)]
