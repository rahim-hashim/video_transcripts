# National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan says U.S. pressing "relentlessly" for hostage release
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [February 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU)
*  We're joined now by White House National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=0.0s)]
*  Jake, it's good to have you back here with us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=4.0s)]
*  The White House described Friday's response as a multi-tiered plan, not one and done. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=7.28s)]
*  Is this an open-ended military campaign, and how are you going to define success? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=14.56s)]
*  Well, it's true, Margaret, that what happened on Friday was the beginning, not the end of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  our response, and that there will be more steps, some seen, some perhaps unseen. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=24.22s)]
*  We're all in an effort to send a very clear message that when American forces are attacked, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=29.959999999999997s)]
*  when Americans are killed, as three service members tragically were at Tower 22, we will [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  respond and we will respond forcefully and we will respond in a sustained way. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=40.68s)]
*  I would not describe it as some open-ended military campaign. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=44.84s)]
*  We have a concept of how we intend to respond. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=48.4s)]
*  I'm not going to telegraph it on this show, but we will execute that concept with the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=50.64s)]
*  kind of professionalism that only the U.S. military can bring to bear. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=55.44s)]
*  So the U.S. officially has not assessed that Tehran directed the attack, but has Tehran [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=59.28s)]
*  done anything to rein in the militias that they fund and arm? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=65.72s)]
*  Well, we know that Iran is behind these militia groups. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=70.0s)]
*  They train them, they fund them, they arm them, as your question suggests, and they [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=74.64s)]
*  do have influence with them. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=79.92s)]
*  And I can't sit here today and tell you that Tehran has shifted its policy. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=81.76s)]
*  What I can tell you is what the United States' approach is going to be, which is that if [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=86.8s)]
*  we continue to see threats and attacks from these militia groups, we will respond to them [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=90.48s)]
*  and we will hold those responsible accountable. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  There are reportedly civilian casualties in Iraq and in Syria as a result of these strikes. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=98.32s)]
*  Does the U.S. assess that any of those hit in these strikes were actually Iranian al-Quds [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=104.64s)]
*  force personnel, or did the fact that this was so telegraphed in advance give those personnel [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=109.64s)]
*  time to go to ground? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=116.8s)]
*  Well, first of all, Margaret, on the telegraphed point, President Biden has been saying for [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=118.84s)]
*  months that he would respond to attacks. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=124.4s)]
*  We have responded to previous attacks, and when three service members were killed, of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=127.84s)]
*  course Iran knew that the United States would respond. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=132.44s)]
*  So the idea that somehow this was telegraphed, I think, is a bit more of a political talking [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=136.66s)]
*  point than a reality. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  Secondly, the targets that we hit, we believe with conviction, were valid military targets. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=144.74s)]
*  They were ammunition depots and command and control centers. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  They were the instruments that Iranian-backed Shia militia groups were using to attack American [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=155.5s)]
*  forces. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=161.1s)]
*  We are looking at the casualties, who precisely was killed. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=162.14s)]
*  I don't have anything to report to you this morning publicly on that, but we will continue [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=166.26s)]
*  to make our assessments. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=170.89999999999998s)]
*  But no one, for example, in IRGC leadership, in Iranian leadership, no one of significance [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=172.34s)]
*  was targeted? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=178.34s)]
*  As I said, we are continuing to assess the battle damage, and when we are prepared to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  share that publicly, we'll do so. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=185.28s)]
*  I am not prepared to do that with you today. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=186.85999999999999s)]
*  Jake, half of U.S. adults, according to the AP, say Israel's military campaign in Gaza [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=190.54s)]
*  has gone too far, and 31 percent approve of Biden's handling of the conflict. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=197.82s)]
*  At what point is this open-ended Israel conflict in Gaza not just a political problem, but [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=204.22s)]
*  a national security one for the United States to be so closely associated with the Netanyahu [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=212.34s)]
*  government's war with the civilian casualties that we've seen to date and the starvation [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=219.62s)]
*  of women and children in Gaza? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=224.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, first, Margaret, I'm glad you put the question in those terms because we don't design [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=226.78s)]
*  our policy towards Israel or Gaza or the Middle East based on politics. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=233.38s)]
*  We do it based on the national security interests of the United States. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=237.26s)]
*  And we've been clear from the beginning that we believe that Israel has a right to respond [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=240.0s)]
*  to the horrific attacks of October 7th and to deal with the threat that Hamas continues [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=244.22s)]
*  to pose to Israel as it asserts that it wants to conduct another October 7th and then another [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=248.74s)]
*  one until Israel no longer exists. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=254.02s)]
*  But we've been equally clear that we have to look out for and respond to the immense [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=256.54s)]
*  and terrible suffering of the Palestinian people. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=263.62s)]
*  And that means pressing Israel on issues related to the humanitarian assistance that we have [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=266.9s)]
*  helped unlock and get into the Gaza Strip, and there needs to be much more of it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=272.98s)]
*  Secretary Blinken is on his way to the region as we speak, and this will be a top priority [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=278.62s)]
*  of his when he sees the Israeli government, that the needs of the Palestinian people are [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=282.62s)]
*  something that are going to be front and center in the U.S. approach and that we want to ensure [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=287.38s)]
*  that they are getting access to life-saving food, medicine, water, shelter, and we'll [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=293.46s)]
*  continue to press until that is done. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=298.14s)]
*  But it's still not the degree to which you are asking for. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=300.46s)]
*  Today, Prime Minister Netanyahu said Israel will not agree to a deal that is related to [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=304.02s)]
*  the release of terrorists. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=309.18s)]
*  His national security minister, Ben Gavir, gave an interview to The Wall Street Journal [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=311.26s)]
*  saying he'd oppose any deal with Hamas that would end the war or free Palestinian prisoners [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=315.38s)]
*  and said Donald Trump would be better for Israel than Joe Biden. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=320.58s)]
*  Does Benjamin Netanyahu have control of his government? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=325.22s)]
*  And are these right-wing ministers risking blowing up a hostage deal that the United [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=328.8s)]
*  States is trying to put together? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=334.4s)]
*  Look, I'm going to let the Israeli government and Israeli politicians speak for themselves. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=336.12s)]
*  They certainly have no trouble doing so, as you just related. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=340.88s)]
*  We're only going to speak for ourselves. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=343.8s)]
*  And from our perspective, a hostage deal that brings out the hostages, including the American [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=345.41999999999996s)]
*  hostages, that gets a sustained pause in hostilities so that life-saving assistance can more easily [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  get to the Palestinian people, this is in the national security interest of the United [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=357.4s)]
*  States. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=362.88s)]
*  And we're going to press for it relentlessly, as the president has done, including recently [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=363.88s)]
*  in calls with the leaders of Egypt and Qatar, the two countries that are central brokers [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=367.76s)]
*  in this effort. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=371.88s)]
*  So it is a paramount priority for us. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=373.09999999999997s)]
*  The Israeli government can answer whether it's a paramount priority for them. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=375.08s)]
*  And depending on that answer, they'll also have to answer to the Israeli people. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=378.88s)]
*  Well, do I understand you saying there then that Israel's government has not signed off [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=383.6s)]
*  fully on the proposal that the U.S. is backing? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=388.24s)]
*  I know Qatar has said they're waiting on Hamas. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=391.20000000000005s)]
*  No, no, you haven't. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=394.40000000000003s)]
*  You didn't hear me correctly. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=396.44s)]
*  Israel has, in fact, put forward a proposal. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=397.44s)]
*  And as Qatar has indicated publicly, the ball is in Hamas's court at this time. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=400.8s)]
*  OK, because this minister was threatening politically the prime minister in regard to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=406.0s)]
*  a hostage deal and saying he would vote against it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=411.0s)]
*  Well, right. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=413.84s)]
*  There seems to be obviously an ongoing debate spilling out in public within the Israeli [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=415.44s)]
*  government. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=419.4s)]
*  And again, I'm not going to speak to that debate. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=420.4s)]
*  They have to decide for themselves and they'll have to work through their own political system. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=422.8s)]
*  And do you stand by your statement you made on this show previously that Palestinians [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=427.76s)]
*  in Gaza have a right to return to their homes? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=432.0s)]
*  That's also an issue of conflict right now. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=434.56s)]
*  I do stand by my statement. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=437.48s)]
*  It's not Jake Sullivan's statement. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=439.42s)]
*  That's a statement of administration policy. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=441.54s)]
*  Secretary Blinken has laid it out now in full. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=443.34000000000003s)]
*  We do not want to see a circumstance in which Israel occupies Gaza or where there is an [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=447.56s)]
*  effort to permanently displace Palestinians from their homes. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=455.14000000000004s)]
*  Jake Sullivan, thank you for your time this morning. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-36Hz7bPiU&t=459.1s)]
