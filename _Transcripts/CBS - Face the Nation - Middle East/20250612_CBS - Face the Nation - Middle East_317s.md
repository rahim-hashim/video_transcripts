# Israel acted alone in strikes on Iran, Rubio says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U)
*  But I want to get to CBS News senior White House correspondent, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=0.0s)]
*  Weijia Jiang, who's live for us at the White House. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=3.04s)]
*  Weijia, do we have any response yet from President Trump [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  or any members of the White House there? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=8.84s)]
*  Liz, we just got our first statement from the White House. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=12.16s)]
*  It is from the Secretary of State Marco Rubio, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  and it really stresses what this administration wants to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=18.0s)]
*  focus on right now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=22.2s)]
*  And that is the message that this was a unilateral attack [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=24.0s)]
*  that the U.S. was not part of this Israeli military operation. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=27.76s)]
*  It's a relatively short statement, Liz, and because we just got it, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=32.56s)]
*  I do want to read it for our viewers with us tonight. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=35.800000000000004s)]
*  It says from the Secretary of State Marco Rubio, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=39.28s)]
*  for its self-defense. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  President Trump and the administration have taken all necessary steps [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=59.36s)]
*  to protect our forces and remain in close contact with our regional partners. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=63.68s)]
*  Let me be clear, Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=68.48s)]
*  Now, just today, Liz, the president said he did not want to use the word [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=73.88s)]
*  imminent when asked how soon Israel could launch an attack on Iran. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=77.84s)]
*  But he said it's certainly something that could happen. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=83.36s)]
*  We also know that the administration yesterday sent urgent messages [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  for American personnel in the region to evacuate. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=90.12s)]
*  So, you know, clearly the president was ahead of this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  We don't know exactly how much he was briefed and how much he got a heads up [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=96.68s)]
*  before tonight's attack happened. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=101.16s)]
*  We haven't heard directly from him since the attack, Liz. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=103.4s)]
*  But even today, as he was talking about the real possibility that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=107.12s)]
*  something in his words could happen, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=112.04s)]
*  he was still expressing optimism that there could be a deal with Iran. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  Now, how realistic that is, we have to see. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=120.08000000000001s)]
*  But as of tonight, that meeting for a sixth round of talks between [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=122.2s)]
*  this administration and Tehran to reach some sort of a nuclear agreement [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=127.04s)]
*  is still on the books. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=131.16s)]
*  We wait now to hear from President Trump. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=132.96s)]
*  But certainly, again, just to recap what we've heard so far from the White House, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=136.16s)]
*  they want to make clear the U.S. was not involved in this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=140.52s)]
*  And they have a stark warning for Iran tonight not to target any U.S. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=143.84s)]
*  forces or facilities, because obviously that would change the calculation [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  of U.S. involvement, Liz. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=153.68s)]
*  Yes, and we thank you so much. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=155.36s)]
*  And we want to reiterate there's going to be a cabinet meeting tomorrow [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=156.84s)]
*  at the White House with apparently the entire cabinet will be there. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=160.12s)]
*  And I'm curious what big decisions the U.S. officials are facing right now, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=164.0s)]
*  given the negotiations that are going on with Iran and the relationship with Israel. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=168.36s)]
*  Well, I think the president made pretty clear today that at this point, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=174.56s)]
*  the ball is in Iran's court. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=178.4s)]
*  He said he is hoping that Iran is willing to give things up that as of right now, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=180.12s)]
*  they don't want to give up. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=185.56s)]
*  And it is very likely he's talking about Iran's level of enrichment of uranium, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=187.0s)]
*  which is required to produce nuclear power, but also a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=194.8s)]
*  And so I think they are closely monitoring how Iran is going to respond to this. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  But it's also notable that they have made abundantly clear that they do not want a part [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=208.16s)]
*  in this direct conflict between Israel and Iran. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  They are just monitoring to see if Iran, you know, impacts any Americans [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  and U.S. facilities in the region. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=226.0s)]
*  And so you're right that he is convening a cabinet meeting for tomorrow morning, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=229.32s)]
*  although we should mention that was already planned before this strike happened. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=234.0s)]
*  But obviously, this will drive the conversation as he meets with his top advisors. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=238.56s)]
*  And any idea, Ouija, and I know this is all very fresh, but any idea if he has a plan [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=244.88s)]
*  to talk with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the events that just unfolded? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=249.04s)]
*  We don't have any indication yet. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=255.28s)]
*  Today, he was asked what information the Israelis have shared with him about a potential strike. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=258.08s)]
*  And he said they haven't shared anything, but he also painted a very realistic picture [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=264.56s)]
*  that, you know, something may develop. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=269.52s)]
*  He did not skirt around that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=272.24s)]
*  He did not, you know, avoid talking about it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=274.08s)]
*  But he didn't offer any specificity in terms of a timeline or any conversations [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=276.88s)]
*  that he has had directly with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=282.4s)]
*  And so I'm sorry, I'm just reading some notes just in case we are getting new information [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=286.48s)]
*  from the White House. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=292.24s)]
*  And so at this point, we don't know what conversations are going to happen. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=293.36s)]
*  But certainly that is a critical one. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=299.92s)]
*  It does sound like this administration got some kind of a heads up or a warning [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=302.0s)]
*  that Israel was going to do this tonight based on that statement from Rubio. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=308.32s)]
*  All right, Ouija Jang live for us at the White House. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=313.2s)]
*  Thanks so much for that update. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03w5blBYr8U&t=315.28s)]
