# Israel intercepted missile Hezbollah launched at Tel Aviv, Israeli military says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs)
*  of an all-out war in the Middle East are ramping up as cross-border strikes continue between [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=4.32s)]
*  Lebanon's Health Minister says 51 people were killed and more than 200 injured during the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  latest round of Israeli strikes just today. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=10.5s)]
*  This comes after the Hezbollah militant group fired a missile at Tel Aviv in its deepest [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=13.42s)]
*  strike yet into Israel. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=18.56s)]
*  The IDF says it intercepted the missile and in response will activate reserve troops to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=20.44s)]
*  the northern border. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=25.66s)]
*  According to the Associated Press, just a short time ago, Israeli forces are considering [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=27.2s)]
*  a potential ground invasion in Lebanon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=31.8s)]
*  CBS News contributor Robert Berger joins us now from Jerusalem with more on this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=36.4s)]
*  Robert, you've got civilians being killed in Lebanon. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=39.8s)]
*  You've got Israelis terrified for their lives. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=42.72s)]
*  What's the latest on the fighting at this hour? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=45.68s)]
*  Well, the Israelis are launching airstrikes all day long, basically, and Hezbollah has [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=48.28s)]
*  been firing dozens of rockets across the border targeting northern Israel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=55.12s)]
*  Of course, the big news of the day was this ballistic missile that was fired at Tel Aviv. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=60.72s)]
*  This is the first time Hezbollah has ever targeted Tel Aviv, which is obviously ramping [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=67.16s)]
*  up the conflict and is a serious escalation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=73.88s)]
*  This ballistic missile actually carried hundreds of pounds of explosives, but it was intercepted [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=81.54s)]
*  by Israeli defenses and then Israel responding with those airstrikes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=88.14s)]
*  On both sides of the border, as you say, people are terrified. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=93.94000000000001s)]
*  You have at least 200,000 people that have been displaced in the recent fighting this [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=97.86000000000001s)]
*  week in Lebanon. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=105.22s)]
*  Of course, 60 or 70,000 Israelis have been out of their homes for the past 11 months. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=106.82s)]
*  And Robert, we know Secretary of State Antony Blinken joined CBS Mornings today to try and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=113.58s)]
*  talk about the war in Gaza. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=118.3s)]
*  Let's play a little bit of that for our viewers. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=120.78s)]
*  We've been working on this ceasefire deal for a while. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=123.85999999999999s)]
*  We have an agreement, a piece of paper that's got 18 paragraphs. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=127.25999999999999s)]
*  15 of them are agreed. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=130.22s)]
*  The last three continue to need some work. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=131.72s)]
*  The problem we have right now is that Hamas hasn't been engaging on it for the last couple [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=133.94s)]
*  of weeks. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=137.38s)]
*  And Sinwar, its leader, has been talking about an endless war of attrition. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=138.38s)]
*  Now, if he really cares about the Palestinian people, he'd bring this agreement over the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=142.06s)]
*  finish line. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=146.62s)]
*  So we just heard, Robert, in your analysis of how things are heating up on the northern [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=147.62s)]
*  border between Israel and Hezbollah, the problems with trying to get a ceasefire in terms of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=153.06s)]
*  Gaza and the fighting between Israel and Hamas. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=161.06s)]
*  What are the main sticking points in this ceasefire? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=163.34s)]
*  Why is Hamas not agreeing to it? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=166.3s)]
*  Well, you know, there's a new diplomatic initiative now by the United States to try and link the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=168.62s)]
*  Lebanon crisis with Gaza and try and get a deal that would stop the war on both fronts. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=176.02s)]
*  And this is focusing right now at the United Nations, with Lebanese officials being their [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=183.72s)]
*  leaders, being their Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu heading to the UN. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=188.22s)]
*  There's hope that maybe the two issues, the two conflicts can be linked. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=193.85999999999999s)]
*  And there's talk about a possible pause in the fighting, maybe a few weeks, that would [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=199.29999999999998s)]
*  help get this diplomatic initiative going. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=205.18s)]
*  The sticking points in Lebanon are that Israel wants Hezbollah to move about 18 miles north [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=211.18s)]
*  of the border so it no longer poses a threat to Israeli civilians. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=218.34s)]
*  And in Gaza, the sticking point has been pretty much the same. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=223.38s)]
*  Hamas wants a complete end to the war. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=227.98000000000002s)]
*  And Israel has refused to agree to that, saying it won't stop the war until Hamas is defeated [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=231.62s)]
*  and destroyed. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=238.22s)]
*  All right, Robert Berger, thank you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUvqezAjcs&t=239.22s)]
