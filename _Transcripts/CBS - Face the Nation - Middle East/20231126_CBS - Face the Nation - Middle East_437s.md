# UNRWA's Phillippe Lazzarini says Gaza humanitarian crisis has gotten "much worse"
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc)
*  We go now to the Commissioner General of the United Nations Relief and Works [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=0.0s)]
*  Agency for Palestine Refugees, Philippe Lazzarini. Welcome back to Face the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=4.46s)]
*  Nation. I understand you're joining us from Amman, Jordan this morning. Roughly [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=8.76s)]
*  108 of your staff members in Gaza have been killed according to your reports. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=17.78s)]
*  That's the highest number of UN workers killed in the history of the United [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=24.18s)]
*  Nations. We are very sorry for your loss. I'm wondering, given that you are [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=28.72s)]
*  sharing your location coordinates with both parties, why is there still such a [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=35.58s)]
*  high death toll? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  Yes, this is definitely a devastating news and the United Nations never, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=45.32s)]
*  ever lost as many staff in a such a short period in the conflict. Now it is [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=50.2s)]
*  true, Margaret, that about 70 of our location, sheltering more than one [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=58.32s)]
*  million people, have been hit since the beginning of the conflict. And we had [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=65.12s)]
*  about 200 people who have been killed, plus 100 injured. And this despite the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=70.8s)]
*  fact that we are constantly de-conflicting and notifying the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=76.2s)]
*  Israeli authorities, but also the de facto UN de Hamas about our location. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  So who is hitting these locations? I've seen your own UN reports that say you [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=88.08s)]
*  discovered some UNRWA schools have been used for military purposes, Israeli [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=94.52s)]
*  tanks nearby. You've also seen weapon storage in some of these facilities. Is [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=98.56s)]
*  that Hamas? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=103.86s)]
*  We will definitely need to have an investigation about all these allegations. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=106.04s)]
*  For the time being, we are in no position to determine who has been behind each of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=111.96s)]
*  the incidents we have reported until now. But clearly here, this has been a [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  blatant disregard of international human rights law, a blatant disregard of UN [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=123.96s)]
*  premises, and a blatant disregard of a civilian population. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=129.76s)]
*  The White House says Israel's combat operations in South Gaza should not [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  happen until there are assurances about protecting civilians in the south of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=139.96s)]
*  Gaza. Have you been given any kind of assurances here? Are you confident you [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  can operate there safely? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=152.72s)]
*  We are not confident because there haven't been any safe place until now in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=156.52s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. People were initially asked to move from the north to the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=161.08s)]
*  south, and we have seen that a number of people have been killed in the south. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=165.92s)]
*  So there haven't been any safe place yet. Having said that, we have this week [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=171.11999999999998s)]
*  reached more than one million people, more than half of the people in the Gaza [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=177.2s)]
*  Strip being sheltered in UN premises. And we will continue to ask the Israeli [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=181.6s)]
*  authorities and the warring parties to make sure that these places be [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=188.2s)]
*  respected in line with their obligations with international human rights law. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=193.0s)]
*  How dire is the humanitarian situation? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=198.52s)]
*  Listen, I went back last week to Gaza for the second time. The situation is [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=202.6s)]
*  much worse than what I saw the first time. Just to give you an example, I [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=208.44s)]
*  visited the vocational training center of UNWA. We are sheltering 35,000 people [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=214.04s)]
*  there. I met a father with his five children. They live in a four square [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=220.64s)]
*  meter makeshift, basically sleeping on the floor, no mattress, no blanket. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  Winter is coming. And all of a sudden, it is bursting into tears and saying, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=231.88s)]
*  well, my dignity has been stripped. And his story is a story of a habit of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  thousands of people in the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=243.88s)]
*  We have to take a break here and we'll continue our conversation on the other [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=246.2s)]
*  side of it. Please stay with us. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=249.64s)]
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation and our conversation with Philippe Lazzarini of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=255.23999999999998s)]
*  the UN Relief Agency for Palestine Refugees. Mr. Commissioner General, how [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=258.44s)]
*  much aid is getting in to Gaza now as part of this diplomatic deal? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  Since today, since the beginning of the truce, we have seen a significant [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  increase of trucks entering into Gaza. I would say until Thursday, we had an [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=276.88s)]
*  average of 40 trucks, which was far, far, far too little compared to the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=282.44s)]
*  immense need in the Gaza Strip. And now, I would say over the last three days, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=288.56s)]
*  we had an average of 160 to 200 trucks thrusting and entering into Gaza. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=293.8s)]
*  Having said that, I do believe that the 200 are hardly enough for an [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=302.16s)]
*  humanitarian response. If we want to reverse the impact of the situation in [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=308.52000000000004s)]
*  the Gaza Strip, we need also commercial fuel. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  I want to ask you, sir, about your organization, which continues to be [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=318.88000000000005s)]
*  criticized by some in Israel, including their intelligence minister who published [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=323.12s)]
*  an op-ed recently in the Jerusalem Post. And she said, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=328.24s)]
*  UNRWA has done zero to help the Palestinian people, even though it has an [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=332.96s)]
*  annual budget of over a billion dollars. She argued that the international [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=336.84s)]
*  community should instead fund the costs of moving Palestinians to other countries. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=341.88s)]
*  I wonder how you respond to that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=348.76s)]
*  You know that UNRWA has a mandate from the General Assembly and basically is [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=352.48s)]
*  requested to provide protection and assistance to the Palestinian refugees [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=357.72s)]
*  across the region, not only in Gaza, until today there is a fair and lasting [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=361.8s)]
*  political solution. Since then, when we refer to the one billion dollar budget, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=368.0s)]
*  we have in our school more than half a million girls and boys doing education [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=373.44s)]
*  from grade one to grade nine. We have more than two million people benefiting [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=380.08s)]
*  from our primary health, not only in Gaza, but also in Lebanon, in Syria, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=385.12s)]
*  in Jordan, in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=390.44s)]
*  And resettling all of the Palestinians, I imagine you would strongly disagree [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  with. UNRWA does not have the mandate from the General Assembly to resettle [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=401.04s)]
*  the Palestinian refugees. The assumption is there needs to be a political [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  solution, a lasting one, and that's the way an organization like ours would [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=412.59999999999997s)]
*  then phase out. Unfortunately, for 75 years, there haven't been any of such [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=419.32s)]
*  a solution and basically we are dealing with the longest lasting, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=424.96s)]
*  unresolved conflict. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=429.08s)]
*  Understood. We will continue watching what happens, Commissioner General. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=431.2s)]
*  Thank you for your time today. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_pM_vb8bgc&t=435.03999999999996s)]
