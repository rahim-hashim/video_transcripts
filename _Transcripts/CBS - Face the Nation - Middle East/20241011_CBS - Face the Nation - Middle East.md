*  You see the people behind me, they're standing on what used to be a building that's been [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia44rKIXjgg&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  completely obliterated. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia44rKIXjgg&t=25.96s)]
*  And residents here tell us that this strike came last night without any warning whatsoever, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia44rKIXjgg&t=28.48s)]
*  leaving over 20 people killed and more than 100 people wounded. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia44rKIXjgg&t=35.0s)]

*  He lives in this area. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia44rKIXjgg&t=43.8s)]
*  When the news started to filter in that there'd been a strike in the area, of course, frantically, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia44rKIXjgg&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  he immediately started phoning his family. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia44rKIXjgg&t=50.88s)]
*  He couldn't reach them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia44rKIXjgg&t=53.14s)]
*  Their phones were off. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia44rKIXjgg&t=54.64s)]
*  Fortunately, they were all safe. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia44rKIXjgg&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  They'd had to leave their phones behind in the chaos and rushed away. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia44rKIXjgg&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  He then came to the scene and told us that there were people running around screaming, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia44rKIXjgg&t=63.16s)]
*  covered in dust, covered in blood, desperately trying to flee this area. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia44rKIXjgg&t=67.88s)]
