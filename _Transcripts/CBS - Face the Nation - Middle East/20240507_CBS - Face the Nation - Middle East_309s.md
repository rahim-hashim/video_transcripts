# Why the White House is delaying some ammo shipments to Israel
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [May 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8)
*  Sources tell CBS News the U.S. has postponed delivery of some ammunition to Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=0.0s)]
*  One U.S. official says that holdup is to send a message to the Israeli government about [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=6.4s)]
*  the Biden administration's opposition to the operation in Ra'aq. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=11.14s)]
*  Ed O'Keefe joins us now from the White House. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=15.92s)]
*  Talk to us about this operation in Ra'aq and how it is affecting some of the administration's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=19.28s)]
*  decision-making. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=26.48s)]
*  We have just learned that it paused at least one shipment of aid to Israel, which is unprecedented. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=27.56s)]
*  It is. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=34.44s)]
*  CBS News has learned, per two U.S. officials, that there was a shipment paused in recent [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=36.52s)]
*  days, one of those officials telling CBS News it was designed to send a message to the Israeli [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=42.32s)]
*  government about the Biden administration's concern with that ongoing military operation [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=47.04s)]
*  now into Ra'aq. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=52.28s)]
*  It is a sign, again, of how the dynamic between the United States and Israel is changing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=53.28s)]
*  While the president and the prime minister may spend time on the phone together, at least [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=58.56s)]
*  yesterday, which is always seen as a good sign of good communication if the two leaders [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=62.2s)]
*  are doing it, that now actual military equipment may be slowed at the least has got to worry [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=66.72s)]
*  Israel and certainly its most ardent backers on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=74.66s)]
*  But it's a sign, too, that the administration's trying to send signals, even if it's quietly, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=77.94s)]
*  in that kind of a way, to Israel to say, don't do this, as we've been trying to tell you [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=83.52s)]
*  in all sorts of ways over the last several weeks. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=88.68s)]
*  It is something that continues to occupy a lot of time here at the White House. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=91.64s)]
*  The president himself saying very little about this publicly for fear of upsetting the ongoing [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=95.16s)]
*  talks today instead focused on Holocaust Remembrance Day and giving a more formal set of remarks [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=101.56s)]
*  on his concerns about anti-Semitism. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=108.34s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=110.08s)]
*  President Biden has been pushing Israel not to invade Ra'aqa at all. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  Today, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had this to say about Israel's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  operation. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  What I will say is the Israeli government has spoken to this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  So obviously, they can speak to their operations. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=128.12s)]
*  They said it was limited. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=130.6s)]
*  This was about making sure that designated cut of Hamas, of their ability to smuggle [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=132.2s)]
*  weapons, smuggle funds, and it was a limited operation. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  Again, I would let them speak for themselves. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=142.16s)]
*  And what I will say is we have been very clear from here about our concerns about a major [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  operation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=150.0s)]
*  But, Ed, one thing that the administration has not been that clear on, and it's something [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=151.0s)]
*  that you actually pressed them about earlier this week, was how they define an invasion [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  in Terafa, because now they are really trying to make the point that, look, this is very [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=164.0s)]
*  limited in scope. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=168.83999999999997s)]
*  It is not major. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=170.16s)]
*  And therefore, it appears that there's not going to be consequences for Israel. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  Is that how you're reading this, too? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=177.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  They've twisted themselves up into quite the pretzel in trying to justify not only [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  their concern, but then what it is Israel may or may not be doing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  Because as we spoke with them yesterday, some kind of air operation was underway over Ra'aqa. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=188.5s)]
*  And then later on, we saw this apparent move into the region and then the taking of the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=193.54s)]
*  checkpoint overnight, which you would think violates everything they've been talking [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=198.64s)]
*  about over the last several weeks. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  But then today and yesterday, John Kirby, the national security spokesman, sort of reiterated [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=204.88s)]
*  the idea that as long as we're not seeing massive civilian losses, this may be something [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=209.27999999999997s)]
*  they have to bear. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  And that is essentially where it appears to be right now, given that this taking of the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  crossing appeared to happen with very little resistance and certainly no real widespread [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  harm to civilians. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=227.6s)]
*  We'll see if that holds, depending on whatever it is Israel may decide to do in the coming [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  days as the talks continue between Israel and Hamas. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=233.68s)]
*  Well, that is a really important point, Ed, because one way to get at this, to have Israel [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=237.04s)]
*  not invade Ra'aqa in this major way, is a successful hostage deal. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  And we know that CIA Director Bill Burns is representing the U.S. in Cairo for the next [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=251.24s)]
*  round of negotiations. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=256.56s)]
*  So what is the White House saying about how things are going so far? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=258.35999999999996s)]
*  They are encouraged that Israeli and Hamas representatives will be at these meetings. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=262.68s)]
*  Obviously, the CIA Director is involved, and then Egyptian and Qatari officials as well. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=267.56s)]
*  But that the two warring sides are now involved and plan to be there for these talks is what [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=273.08s)]
*  gives the White House sustained hope that something may ultimately come from this. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=277.82s)]
*  We'll have to wait and see, obviously. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=282.08s)]
*  We've been at junctures like this in the last several months before, only to see things [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=284.0s)]
*  fall apart or get torn asunder by some military operation or some other unforeseen attack. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=288.36s)]
*  Let's see if this holds now. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=294.4s)]
*  But the public line from here, at least, is some sense of hope and optimism, given that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=296.02s)]
*  everybody's back at a table, or will be soon, to discuss the particulars. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=299.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=303.28s)]
*  We will all be watching very closely, Ed. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=304.28s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fted15Bzo8&t=306.36s)]
