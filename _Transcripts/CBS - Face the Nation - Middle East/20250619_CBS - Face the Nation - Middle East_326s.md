# Former U.S. ambassador to Israel on Trump and Iran
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw)
*  We are joined now by Daniel Shapiro, who served as the U.S. Ambassador to Israel in the Obama administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Shapiro, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=5.44s)]
*  I want to start by playing a little more of what Prime Minister Netanyahu said today in praising President Trump. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=7.04s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=12.72s)]
*  President Trump will do what's best for America. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=13.92s)]
*  I trust his judgment. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=16.48s)]
*  He's a tremendous friend, a tremendous world leader, a tremendous friend of Israel and the Jewish people. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  And we will do what we have to do, and we are doing it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=23.52s)]
*  What, if any, effect do you think those comments from the Prime Minister are having on the president's decision making? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=28.08s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Ed. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=37.04s)]
*  Look, I think the president has to not be swayed by how a foreign leader speaks about him or of him and really focus on what the U.S. interest is and what the outcome we want to achieve is. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=38.0s)]
*  The outcome that he set as his goal in the negotiations that preceded the Israeli operation was ending all enrichment in Iran. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=48.72s)]
*  And that is the way you would ensure that Iran would never be able to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=56.96s)]
*  And it really comes down to that underground side at Fordow. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=61.28s)]
*  Now, we know that the U.S. has unique capabilities, bunker busting capabilities to get to that site different from Israel's. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=64.48s)]
*  Now, by making clear that he has that option available by putting in place the forces necessary, he's opened a window of time, fairly narrow to make clear to the Iranians. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=71.36s)]
*  And it should be presented this way. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  You're going to have to give that facility up one way or the other. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=82.4s)]
*  You can give it up in this window of time through diplomacy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  Maybe this meeting with the European foreign ministers tomorrow in Geneva. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=88.0s)]
*  Maybe it'll be supplemented by some Gulf states who are allies of the United States going to Iran and saying, look, you really have to take this deal that's being offered to you. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=90.96s)]
*  Otherwise, it will be this facility destroyed. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=99.6s)]
*  But then he has to be willing to back that up if Iran says no. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=102.0s)]
*  So we have a window of time to either get what we need through diplomacy and if not, then to do it through military force. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=104.72s)]
*  Earlier today, the White House press secretary had this to say about Iran's nuclear capabilities. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=110.56s)]
*  Iran has all that it needs to achieve a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=117.68s)]
*  All they need is a decision from the supreme leader to do that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=122.08s)]
*  And it would take a couple of weeks to complete the production of that weapon, which would, of course, pose an existential threat not just to Israel, but to the United States and to the entire world. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=125.44s)]
*  Based on your knowledge of the situation, do you agree with her assessment? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=135.52s)]
*  I don't have access to the most recent intelligence, but I served in the government until January. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=139.6s)]
*  And everything we know about the Iranian nuclear program tells us they are very, very close to this capability. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=146.96s)]
*  First of all, the International Atomic Energy Agency has documented that Iran has about 10 bombs worth of 60 percent enriched uranium and the ability on day's notice to enrich that further to 90 percent, which is weapons grade. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=152.72s)]
*  So on enrichment, they're basically there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=164.88s)]
*  Then we know that they have taken steps to do research and get other technologies organized so that if the supreme leader gave the order to weaponized, actually build a weapon with that enriched uranium, they would be able to do it in a fairly short period of time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  And they've gotten that time progressively smaller. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=182.4s)]
*  So I don't know if it's two weeks, three weeks, but it's too close for comfort for a regime that openly calls for Israel's destruction that has twice last year conducted a blatant act of war, massive barrages of missiles and drones against Israel that arms proxies around the region. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=184.64s)]
*  It's simply too close for comfort to allow them to get that close. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=201.27999999999997s)]
*  And that's why the standard of no enrichment where that means no ability to build a nuclear weapon is the right one. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  And of course, we forget how often the Iranian Revolutionary Guard was involved in targeting or killing American forces in Iraq back in the day as well. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=210.96s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=219.28s)]
*  Now, you served in the Obama administration when the former president reached his nuclear deal with Iran. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=220.08s)]
*  I know it's hard playing what if, but it is part of the political debate and it will be in the coming days. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=224.72s)]
*  Where do you think we'd be if the Trump administration hadn't withdrawn from the U.S. agreement cut by the Obama administration back in 2018? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=229.68s)]
*  You know, when I was ambassador and I spoke to a lot of very skeptical Israelis about that agreement in 2015, I said, look, this isn't a perfect agreement. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=240.0s)]
*  It doesn't solve everything. It buys time. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=249.2s)]
*  It pushes Iran at least a year from the ability to produce a nuclear weapon and will keep them there for 10 to 15 years. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=251.12s)]
*  So that was valuable. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=257.28s)]
*  But there was legitimate concern and criticism of the deal that at the end of that 10 or 15 years, they might then be in a position to rush to break out to a weapon with an industrial scale enrichment program. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=258.64s)]
*  When President Trump withdrew from the agreement in 2018, which I thought was a mistake, he basically shortened that time. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=268.88s)]
*  And so we face this crisis today in 2025 that we might have otherwise faced in 2030. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=274.48s)]
*  So it's not a huge difference in the sense that we probably would have reached this point sooner or later. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=280.16s)]
*  But I don't want us to be hung up on having this debate about history. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=285.92s)]
*  That's too much of the focus of the conversation. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=289.6s)]
*  What did Obama do? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=292.0s)]
*  What did Trump do in 2018? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=292.8s)]
*  Who was right? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=294.8s)]
*  Who was wrong? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=295.36s)]
*  We should really be focused on the outcome we want. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=295.92s)]
*  And the outcome we need is ensuring that Iran has no enrichment capability. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=298.24s)]
*  That's the only way we'll be certain that they will not at some point at the time of their choosing put together this nuclear weapon and pose this existential threat to Israel and to other nations, to our allies and friends, and potentially to even U.S. people in that region as well. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, former U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Daniel Shapiro, thank you for stopping by. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=318.16s)]
*  We'll continue having this conversation. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=321.76s)]
*  We appreciate your perspective today. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNsHFiUFZw&t=323.2s)]
