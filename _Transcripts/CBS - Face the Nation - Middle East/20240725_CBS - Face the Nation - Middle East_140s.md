# Did Netanyahu's address sway congressional lawmakers?
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE)
*  After Washington, Benjamin Netanyahu flies to Florida. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=0.0s)]
*  He's going to Mar-a-Lago to meet with former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=3.2s)]
*  That will happen tomorrow. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=7.0s)]
*  Keep in mind, this will be the first in-person meeting between Trump and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=8.5s)]
*  Netanyahu since the former president left the White House. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=11.76s)]
*  You're looking at file video there of that meeting at that time. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=14.56s)]
*  All of this comes after what was a multi-stop tour of the halls of power in [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Washington for Netanyahu. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=22.28s)]
*  We're talking about members of Congress right now about to go on recess as we [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  look at the Capitol live. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=28.12s)]
*  But CBS News congressional correspondent Scott McFarland is live on the stream [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=29.38s)]
*  right now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=33.22s)]
*  Scott, we understand some last votes are expected today. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=33.58s)]
*  Overall, now that we've had a day to digest it, what's the reaction by lawmakers [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=36.54s)]
*  to what the prime minister had to say? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=40.34s)]
*  He was very firm. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=41.7s)]
*  And this Congress is going to have to approve aid, more foreign aid for [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=45.260000000000005s)]
*  humanitarian needs and more foreign aid for military needs for Israel if they're [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=49.22s)]
*  going to sustain this war against Hamas. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=53.14s)]
*  And Prime Minister Netanyahu is addressing a Congress that is having [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=55.22s)]
*  difficulty moving on anything involving money, including foreign aid. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=58.7s)]
*  Not sure at this moment if he changed hearts and minds about the war in Hamas. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=63.300000000000004s)]
*  There are dozens of congressional Democrats who outright boycotted that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  speech. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=71.10000000000001s)]
*  But whatever he said to them is going to come full circle when they have to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=72.26s)]
*  approve more foreign aid. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=76.5s)]
*  That's the response to his address yesterday now that the prime minister has [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=78.42s)]
*  moved on to the White House. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=81.58s)]
*  Congress has moved on to two other things. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=82.78s)]
*  I'll note the votes today. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=85.06s)]
*  One very political in the U.S. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=86.34s)]
*  House, one potentially very substantive in the U.S. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=87.89999999999999s)]
*  Senate. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=90.42s)]
*  Read the House today along nearly party lines, approved a resolution criticizing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=91.38s)]
*  Vice President Harris for her work on the administration's border initiatives. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=97.74s)]
*  Pure party line vote, nothing to see here, won't become law. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  The U.S. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=106.7s)]
*  Senate began the afternoon trying to get a test vote on a bill that would protect [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSbnIp2rAQE&t=107.17999999999999s)]
