# U.S. launches strikes on 3 Iranian nuclear facilities, Trump says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI)
*  We are breaking news now out of the Middle East. President Trump announced the U.S. has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=0.0s)]
*  attacked three nuclear sites in Iran. In a post on Truth Social, he called the attack [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  successful and says the planes are now outside of Iranian airspace. Mr. Trump went on to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=16.84s)]
*  write, quote, Now is the time for peace. Let's bring in CBS News Middle East reporter Courtney [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=22.64s)]
*  Keeley to bring us the very latest. Courtney. So President Trump just announced this on [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=28.18s)]
*  Truth Social just not very long ago. And what we're trying to do is see if there's any satellite [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=35.86s)]
*  imagery or anything out that would have been taken in real time as those B-2 bombers would [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=42.62s)]
*  have bombed those nuclear plants, especially Fordow, which was a place that would require [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=48.66s)]
*  the stealth B-2 bomber to carry a 30,000 pound bomb over it to bust into the depth of that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=55.86s)]
*  nuclear plant that's built into a mountainside. But it had seemed that President Trump was [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=63.339999999999996s)]
*  reluctant to do that. Now he did say around midweek this week that he could just decide [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=68.82s)]
*  at a moment's notice, I had seen today that B-2 bombers had been moved to Guam. So that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=74.9s)]
*  was a little bit of a note, let's watch this space. And now he has announced in his own [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=81.42s)]
*  space that it has been done, which basically now makes the U.S. complicit in an offensive [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=86.38s)]
*  way in the war. It has taken an offensive stance and bombed Iran not through the, not [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=93.74000000000001s)]
*  by supporting Israel defensively, but by offensively unilaterally doing that. It's something that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=101.7s)]
*  the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had said was a red line, unacceptable. And [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=108.7s)]
*  now we have to see if the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, if the Supreme Leader who appears [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=115.06s)]
*  to be in hiding, if there's any kind of retribution because of these strikes, they could go after [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=120.62s)]
*  softer targets, oil facilities, the 324 moves. Now I don't want to speculate while this is [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=128.22s)]
*  happening in real time. So what we're going to want to see next is there, if there is [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=134.3s)]
*  any degradation on that four-dow nuclear plant, did the job effectively really take it out? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=138.5s)]
*  Now President Trump is saying it's gone, but the planes do take live pictures. Now they're [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=146.34s)]
*  safely out of airspace, President Trump said, and he's calling it successful. The next thing [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=153.34s)]
*  will be to see the satellite images and get analysts and especially nuclear analysts that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=159.78s)]
*  are experts in the nuclear plant. So we'll be looking to the IAEA for reaction. We'll [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=168.54s)]
*  be looking for a lot of different reaction, but also right now seeking comments and videos [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=174.22s)]
*  from inside Iran. They do have a robust system of VPNs. Some of them that were actually supported [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=181.38s)]
*  by the US State Department. The US State Department does not support regime change in any way, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=188.7s)]
*  but it has offered support in VPNs. And right now those are very crucial for the Iranians [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=194.42s)]
*  to get any sort of information out because most of the internet has been cut most of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=201.01999999999998s)]
*  the time in the last several weeks. So I'm working on my sources. It'll just be late, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=206.34s)]
*  middle of the night now, possibly early morning. So soon we will be seeing daylight and we'll [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=214.34s)]
*  be seeing possibly some reactions from the Iranians as well as the Israelis. But this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=221.7s)]
*  is all happening in real time. President Trump's saying that nuclear plant, especially for [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=227.18s)]
*  Dow, one of the three that the US hit, is gone. Now we have to know and see as journalists [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=231.98000000000002s)]
*  and analysts and get the information, but that's probably going to take a few minutes [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=239.85999999999999s)]
*  because this is breaking news right now. Let's recap just for a moment, Cornique. President [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=244.5s)]
*  Trump does say that three nuclear sites in Iran were attacked. What do we know about [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=250.5s)]
*  the conditions of those sites right now? Well, the towns had been hurt before by Israel hitting [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=255.38s)]
*  it hard and taking out the power plant and the backup generators. So just by doing, actually [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=263.38s)]
*  just getting rid of the power plant that operates the towns, there could have been potential [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=270.38s)]
*  centrifuges that had been broken, which are key to enriching uranium. Now, Raphael Grossi [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  from the IAEA, the UN watchdog group, had commented on that this week. Also in terms [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=282.18s)]
*  of Isfahan, it's been unclear how much damage there is. And most nuclear experts were wondering [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=289.58s)]
*  what kind of degradation or what kind of operations would happen at Fordow. Would it be something [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  on the ground and some kind of sabotage by Mossad, for instance? It did seem that President [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=302.46000000000004s)]
*  Trump might have pulled the bait and switched by saying, I'll decide in two weeks, because [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=309.46000000000004s)]
*  clearly he decided within 48 hours. Has there been any response from Iran just yet? Have [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=314.1s)]
*  they even had an opportunity to respond to what's happened? Just stand by. Let me just [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  check one. It's 3.45 in the morning. I'm just checking my sources. They could be hitting [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=325.78000000000003s)]
*  mobile launchers. They're hitting close to Tehran right now, according to somebody I [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=336.34000000000003s)]
*  know there, and they are hitting hard, quote unquote. So it's not just a U.S. bombing of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=341.26s)]
*  the nuclear plants, but this might be Israeli airstrikes that are also launching in Tehran, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=348.46s)]
*  because my source says right now they are hitting hard. So you're saying that the bombardment [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=355.21999999999997s)]
*  is continuing as we speak right now? But not necessarily U.S. at all. President Trump only [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=361.94s)]
*  said that the bombers went after the nuclear plant. Don't forget that Israel is an active [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=368.78s)]
*  kinetic war space and has been bombing Iran daily, so this might be Israeli airstrikes [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=372.86s)]
*  after the U.S. nuclear bombs, and most likely that's Iran hitting, excuse me, Israel hitting [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=379.26s)]
*  Tehran, Iran, and other areas, not the U.S. President Trump only took responsibility and [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=387.74s)]
*  claimed responsibility for these three nuclear plants. He said those planes are back home. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=394.62s)]
*  The president had said that he was going to give Iran two weeks. What could have happened [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=402.22s)]
*  between when this was said, within 48 hours ago and now? Nothing happened significantly [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=407.26s)]
*  in terms of casualties. Whether President Trump had used that to bluff is unclear. Usually [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=415.06s)]
*  he says that part out loud, and we're going to have to listen closely to what else he [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=423.06s)]
*  says. Do we know anything about the reaction of lawmakers right now who pretty much did [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=428.74s)]
*  not want the U.S. to get involved in these kinds of conflicts any longer? Yes, we're [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=435.4s)]
*  going to have to be gathering that, but again it's 8.30 on a Saturday night and this was [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=443.82s)]
*  a surprise attack, so we're going to have to effort more information. It's really President [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=448.22s)]
*  Trump, he's going to be addressing the nation at 10 p.m. about these airstrikes that's a [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=454.94000000000005s)]
*  little over an hour and a half from now, and we'll be learning more then too. And as of [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=463.18s)]
*  right now, we don't know about the casualties experienced in that area where three strikes [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=469.34000000000003s)]
*  were made. We do not hear about the casualties or the damage or anything that could have [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=474.7s)]
*  happened. It did happen in the middle of the night. It's about 3.45 a.m. in Iran right [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=480.94s)]
*  now. So this would have happened in the middle of the night on a Saturday. It's unlikely, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=487.26s)]
*  especially with the Israelis' attacks, it's unlikely that this was fully staffed. Let's [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=493.82s)]
*  talk a little bit more about what the president said on his Truth Social. Can you go over [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=499.7s)]
*  that in terms of what he is telling the American people right now? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=503.86s)]
*  He announced that the U.S. had a successful operation. He put the word bombs in all caps [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=508.26s)]
*  and he said that the U.S. had carried it out, airstrikes, and that Fordow was quote gone. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=515.42s)]
*  Fordow being that nuclear plant, built into the side of a mountain very deep and many [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=524.78s)]
*  people had speculated it would be needed for the U.S. to drop a 30,000 pound bomb [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=531.12s)]
*  in there from one of their stealth B-2 bombers. And that appears to be what happened, but [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=538.72s)]
*  we still need to hear from the president what kind of plane was used and what kind of bomb [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=544.08s)]
*  was used. He's just saying bombs now, but he's not being specific. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=549.44s)]
*  At 10 o'clock he's going to speak to the nation, 10 o'clock Eastern time. What do we think [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=555.4s)]
*  that he will tell the nation at that point in terms of what made him decide to do this [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=559.96s)]
*  at this juncture? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=566.72s)]
*  Well, President Trump often goes off script. It's a question of whether he writes the remarks [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=568.32s)]
*  or somebody writes the remarks for him because this is a different kind of presidency and [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=574.5s)]
*  we've already seen him clearly announce it in his words on Truth Social. So in a more [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=580.16s)]
*  formal addressing the nation from the White House, we'll get more of what maybe the president [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=586.08s)]
*  had decided, helped his decision making or not, but we should be getting more details [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=591.84s)]
*  by then anyway from Iranians and from elected U.S. officials and from his administration [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=599.52s)]
*  as well. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=605.6800000000001s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about where these three sites are located. You mentioned Fordow. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=606.76s)]
*  How close, can you tell me, are these sites to populated areas in Iran? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=611.6s)]
*  They're not sitting within a city population like some of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=617.72s)]
*  were in their private residence when they were hit, when Israel started striking and [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=623.8000000000001s)]
*  they went into civilian neighborhoods because that was the way they were taking out the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=628.8000000000001s)]
*  top leadership of the army and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. This is different. These [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=634.08s)]
*  are plants with locations and like I said, which would be unlikely to have much staff [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=639.92s)]
*  in the middle of the night on a Saturday after nearly a week and a half of Israeli bombings. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=646.12s)]
*  It's not the equivalent of bombing a civilian area where a closely densely populated Tehran, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=653.64s)]
*  for instance, has a population of sort of New York City and London approximately combined. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=662.84s)]
*  I did not happen in city property. You wouldn't have a nuclear plant there. You'd have it [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=668.76s)]
*  outwards, but we just are going to have to continue waiting for information. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=673.56s)]
*  This would be, if they get Fordow, this could be an end to Iranian nuclear power plants [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=679.76s)]
*  because if President Trump is saying they're gone, instead of spinning a centrifuge or [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=687.92s)]
*  downgrading the uranium or killing nuclear scientists like Israel has done, like killing [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=694.44s)]
*  in the past and most recently with the killings of Iranian scientists since they launched [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=700.6800000000001s)]
*  airstrikes a week ago Wednesday, this is different. This is taking out the whole structure and [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=708.1600000000001s)]
*  we're going to need people analyzing satellite imagery to confirm that. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=714.0400000000001s)]
*  Something the American people might be wondering at a point like this, how do we expect the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=720.2s)]
*  world to react to this news? Other nations like China, Russia. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=724.0s)]
*  Well yeah, I mean that's guesswork. Russia does not seem to be supporting Iran completely. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=733.0s)]
*  China is not really speaking out yet, but they will be and that will have to be closely [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=743.2s)]
*  watched. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=748.6s)]
*  Absolutely, because that's I guess the number one concern for people in America is how could [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=750.5999999999999s)]
*  this play out in the world stage and how other countries might react to America bombing these [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=755.4799999999999s)]
*  three sites in Iran. Right Courtney? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=760.9s)]
*  People are quite clear about the Iranian regime, the Iranian nuclear plants and the Iranian [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=763.88s)]
*  people and while it's not in the US government dictate mandate in the State Department for [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=768.7199999999999s)]
*  regime change or to back any political actor coming out of the DOD and bombing nuclear [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=776.36s)]
*  plants is something that President Trump will have to explain the thinking and whether it [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=783.36s)]
*  was within the law or not. This would be a military offensive and we're going to have [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=787.64s)]
*  to hear more about that. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=793.44s)]
*  We don't know if this was just the one plan and to not actually get involved anymore and [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=796.28s)]
*  to leave it the Israelis. Again, we're going to have to hear what President Trump has to [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=802.64s)]
*  say about, but we should be looking for that. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=807.3199999999999s)]
*  And are we hearing anything about the military themselves, any injuries in that respect? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=810.88s)]
*  President Trump said it was a success and that everybody had safely gotten back out [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=818.64s)]
*  of airspace and he did not mention any casualties. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=822.96s)]
*  No casualties, so those are the things that people watch. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=828.72s)]
*  He didn't mention casualties. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=831.12s)]
*  He didn't mention any casualties, okay. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=833.08s)]
*  It's a big difference between what we're hearing from our president or what we hear from our [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=834.64s)]
*  Defense Department, but I can't say that is fact. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=840.12s)]
*  So we're going to just, I want you to sort of just tell us again what we're experiencing [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=844.08s)]
*  right now as people are joining us. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=848.44s)]
*  Tell us exactly, Courtney Keeley is joining us on the line right now to tell us what's [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=852.44s)]
*  happening in Iran. America has struck three sites. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=856.6400000000001s)]
*  Give us more details again for people who are just joining us, what has happened. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=861.0400000000001s)]
*  President Trump announced on True Social not very long ago that, and it was breaking news, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=866.0400000000001s)]
*  that the U.S. had bombed three nuclear plants in Iran, most significantly Fordow, which [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=875.32s)]
*  had a big question mark over it, whether the U.S. would use its stealth B-2 bomber with [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=882.4000000000001s)]
*  its 30,000 pound bomb to destroy deep down into the embedded structure of that nuclear [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=890.0s)]
*  plant Fordow deep into the mountains, deep into the mountain. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=901.0s)]
*  The U.S. does not have that kind of bomb, not that weight, not that depth. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=907.16s)]
*  The U.S. had moved their bombers today, some of them to Guam. It appears that might be [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=914.16s)]
*  where they started the original stationing. They're often in Minnesota, and they had been [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=919.16s)]
*  somewhere near when the U.S. was firing on the Hussies, but they had been returned to [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=924.48s)]
*  the U.S. Today we heard that they'd gone to Guam. It put a big question mark in my mind, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=929.12s)]
*  but Trump had said he was going to wait a few weeks. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=935.24s)]
*  When he just did this, yesterday Italy and Germany and France were talking about some [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=942.24s)]
*  kind of meetings to have with the Iranians, the Iranian foreign minister, more about the [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=949.0s)]
*  nuclear plant. Well, clearly after yesterday, Trump has now made a decision, and that was [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=954.84s)]
*  to take out Fordow, and he says it's gone. Now what the president says, and whether there [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=960.28s)]
*  are casualties or not, or whether it was a complete success, if there's even a way to [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=966.16s)]
*  qualify that, will have to be coming out from experts and satellite imagery. They're going [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=970.1999999999999s)]
*  to have to be, in fact, satellite imagery is going to have to be analyzed, and we're [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=976.6s)]
*  going to have to see what happened. It's early morning just before daylight in Iran, and [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=982.04s)]
*  separately Iran is under heavy bombardment. I'm hearing reports of really heavy bombs [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=989.28s)]
*  hitting everywhere, quote unquote, was what one Iranian told me right now. So this is [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=997.9599999999999s)]
*  the B-2 bombers, President Trump has said, have returned out of airspace, and he's calling [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1003.5999999999999s)]
*  it successful. He will speak at 10 p.m. Eastern time, which is soon. We will see what kind [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1008.76s)]
*  of government officials have something to say. This is happening on a quiet night here [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1015.76s)]
*  in the States. People are going to be scrambling to get more information, to listen to what [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1021.4s)]
*  he says, and to figure out what this actually means. In terms of what other nations say, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1025.8s)]
*  we'll have to look at it. They will speak about it tomorrow. If Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1033.6s)]
*  doesn't say anything tonight, he will usually have his cabinet session on Sunday morning, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1039.16s)]
*  so we'll have to look for that. We'll have to see if Putin says anything. I'm seeing [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1045.0s)]
*  something online, but I cannot confirm that he does not want to engage with Iran. We have [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1048.88s)]
*  to see if that's true or not. I don't know if Russia wants another involvement at all [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1053.32s)]
*  right now with Ukraine. We'll have to see what the Gulf states say. If there's any firing [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1059.08s)]
*  on any of their soft target of oil fields, if there's any firing into the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1065.68s)]
*  If Iran retaliates on soft targets and U.S. allies and possible servicemen will be looking [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1073.0s)]
*  to the region, they do not have weapons that have the trajectory to go as far as the U.S., [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1079.8400000000001s)]
*  but they certainly have the trajectory within the Strait of Hormuz. To close off that waterway, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1086.74s)]
*  to close off those oil depots, and to attack targets like Bahrain, for instance, where [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1093.92s)]
*  the fifth fleet is, and possibly in Iraq. We are just watching now, but these are all [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1100.76s)]
*  possibilities. We have to hear what the president said. There will be many countries with many [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1107.76s)]
*  different opinions. Europe is going to be key. Germans, French, and UK are going to [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1114.64s)]
*  be key. They were originally in this JCPO agreement with Iran and the U.S. We have [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1121.0800000000002s)]
*  to see what their level of support is. We have to see what Netanyahu says and the IDF [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1129.08s)]
*  claims. There's a lot of information that's ongoing right now that we'll be waiting for. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1136.08s)]
*  But right now, President Trump is claiming that he has eliminated, taken out, and the [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1142.56s)]
*  Natanz power plant is gone. That's an offensive move by the U.S. It's not necessarily a declaration [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1149.6799999999998s)]
*  of war, but it's a bombing. Another country is an offensive move that was very unclear [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1156.26s)]
*  if he would do it or not, and now he has. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHPIehkI6QI&t=1163.26s)]
