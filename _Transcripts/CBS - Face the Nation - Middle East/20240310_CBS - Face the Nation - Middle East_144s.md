# Time and food running out in Gaza
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [March 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI)
*  Time and food are running out in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=0.0s)]
*  Ahmed Al-Shair is the deputy head of this neonatal ACU. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=5.96s)]
*  We have approximately three or four babies per incubator, he says. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=8.96s)]
*  There's no oxygen, milk or special medication. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=14.56s)]
*  We sometimes have to choose whose conditions will allow them to live and whose won't. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=17.56s)]
*  Bombed-out infrastructure and lawlessness have impeded food delivery, with aid groups [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=22.28s)]
*  wary of trucking up north where it's most badly needed. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=27.36s)]
*  As an emergency alternative, the U.S. and several other countries are air dropping food [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=30.88s)]
*  and supplies. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=35.12s)]
*  It's not only extremely limited and costly, it's dangerous. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=36.12s)]
*  The Hamas-Rand Health Ministry says at least eight people have been killed by falling cargo [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=40.08s)]
*  after parachutes malfunctioned. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=44.56s)]
*  Those hazards are one reason the U.S. military, with no boots on the ground, will establish [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  a temporary pier off the coast of Gaza so that aid can be delivered by sea. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=51.68s)]

*  The Biden administration has been scrambling for a ceasefire in exchange for the release [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=72.56s)]
*  of dozens of Israeli hostages still in Hamas captivity for five months. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=76.4s)]
*  The Hamas' inability to rescue them has sparked months of tense protests led by their families. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=82.44s)]
*  Despite Israel's punishing airstrikes and ground offensive that the World Food Program [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  warns have pushed a quarter of the population to the doorstep of famine, Hamas has refused [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  to make a deal. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=97.36s)]
*  Somersen Ejwali is an activist with the Palestinian political party Fatah in the West Bank. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=99.0s)]
*  I wish the Americans will be able to put more pressure in the coming few days and rescue [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=103.36s)]
*  the whole region from an explosion. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=111.28s)]
*  It's a ticking bomb situation and I am worried. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  It's a ticking time bomb. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=116.3s)]
*  Nobody can tell you what could happen. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=117.92s)]
*  Something will happen. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=121.16s)]
*  A ticking time bomb that many fear could go off here in Jerusalem, Margaret. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=122.76s)]
*  Hamas is trying to rally Muslims around the world over access restrictions to the old [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc6NJ9IjlCI&t=126.84s)]
