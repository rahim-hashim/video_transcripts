# Former Israeli hostage describes being held captive by Hamas in Gaza
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc)
*  We are continuing our special coverage from Israel as the country marks a full year since [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas launched a surprise attack. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=5.88s)]
*  Around 1,200 people were killed, hundreds more kidnapped, many of whom still remain [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=8.24s)]
*  in captivity. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=12.66s)]
*  And here you're seeing images from around the world as the day is being marked with [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=14.08s)]
*  memorial events, rallies, and protests as people gather to remember those killed while [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=17.5s)]
*  calling for an end to the conflict in Gaza and a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=23.04s)]
*  I'm Erebanet in New York. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=28.16s)]
*  I want to send it back though to Chris Lipsay in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=29.64s)]
*  It's hard to imagine, Chris, but there are some aspects of hope at this time as well. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=32.56s)]
*  That's right, Erebanet. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=36.84s)]
*  I just want to remind you that I'm at one of those memorial events where you can hear [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=37.84s)]
*  them warming up for the events that are about to begin. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=42.32s)]
*  You know, a year on from those October 7 attacks, our Elizabeth Palmer brings us a rare interview [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=45.08s)]
*  with a hostage who came home. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=51.36s)]
*  Moran Stella-Yanai was at the Nova Music Festival when Hamas Gunman spared her life, but not [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=53.68s)]
*  her freedom. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=59.52s)]
*  Moran remembers the beautiful sunrise on October 7th, just before Hamas terrorists stormed [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=62.32s)]
*  the music festival and she was caught. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  He was standing with an iron pipe above my head about to beat me. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=72.68s)]
*  So I was pretending to be fainting and seeming weak. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=77.02000000000001s)]
*  I'll give you whatever you want, whatever I have on me, but please don't kill me. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=82.08s)]
*  Then they took a video of me and posted it on TikTok. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=88.52s)]
*  Of you on the ground basically begging for your life and they posted it on TikTok. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=92.52s)]
*  And that's how my parents found out that I was kidnapped. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=98.78s)]
*  She was held in Gaza, which by then was a war zone. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=102.9s)]
*  I'm half deaf now. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=107.08s)]
*  I lost half of my hearing because of the explosions and the bombings that we were exposed to every [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=108.08s)]
*  single day. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=115.44s)]
*  When densely packed Gaza, Moran was moved from house to house. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=117.28s)]
*  She was beaten, had a broken leg and lice. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=121.74s)]
*  In 54 days she was allowed to shower four times. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=125.36s)]
*  But the real torment was fear. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=129.5s)]
*  The worst moment is that a thought come into your head that says, you know what, maybe [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=132.08s)]
*  they should rape me already and then I will not be fear anymore. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=137.04s)]
*  Almost like bring on the worst. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=141.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=142.6s)]
*  Because it was just do it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=143.6s)]
*  Terrible to be fearful all the time. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=146.0s)]
*  Every single day I was not raped and I was not murdered. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  But in my head they killed me every single day. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=154.34s)]
*  And in my head they raped me every single day. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=158.68s)]
*  She was violated though. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=162.68s)]
*  They searched you. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=165.72000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=167.24s)]
*  And it was very invasive. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=168.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  And it happened more than once. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  Moran resolved to do whatever she had to to stay alive including play cards with her captors. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=174.16s)]
*  So you had to pretend to be their friend? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=181.0s)]
*  It's not really a friend because they hated me. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=183.96s)]
*  They used to laugh at me every day. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=188.34s)]
*  They pointed a gun to my head and threatened me every single day. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=190.24s)]
*  In November there was a ceasefire. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=195.76s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners were released from Israeli jails and Hamas let 105 hostages go in batches [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=198.2s)]
*  over seven days. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=205.6s)]
*  Moran thought she'd be among the first. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  They took us from the house, three people, me and two girls. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=210.2s)]
*  And then on the last second he said, he whispered in my ear, not you, not now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=215.04s)]
*  And he pulled me back by my shirt. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=221.28s)]
*  That must have been crushing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=223.64s)]
*  It was crushing. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  She had to wait another five days and to ward off despair, escaped into fantasy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=226.92s)]
*  When I was eating and even if it was just five spoons of rice, then I pictured a full [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  plate. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=240.16s)]
*  What's more easier to picture is how it feels to hug my mother. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=241.16s)]
*  So what was it like when it finally was real? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=244.44s)]
*  Exactly the same. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=247.39999999999998s)]
*  Exactly the same. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=248.39999999999998s)]
*  She sounded the same. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=249.72s)]
*  She even dressed the same as I pictured them in my head. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=251.39999999999998s)]
*  So for me that was the biggest dream coming true. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=255.74s)]
*  I got to see my family and I had that miracle. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=260.98s)]
*  Elizabeth Palmer there with that powerful report. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLNlS2TtHc&t=266.7s)]
