# Trump's 2-week timeline for Iran and his history of 2-week announcements
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ)
*  Within the next two weeks, that's when the White House says President Trump will make a decision on whether the U.S. should join Israel in its military operations against Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The 14-day clock counting down now as diplomatic attempts to stave off a wider war are kicking into gear. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=9.0s)]
*  Now, if the two weeks notice sounds familiar, it's because he's pushed off decisions like this several times before. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=15.0s)]
*  We're going to be announcing something, I would say, over the next two or three weeks that will be phenomenal in terms of tax. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=22.0s)]
*  I will make that decision, I would say, over the next two weeks, probably right after the G20. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=32.0s)]
*  I can't tell you that, but I'll let you know in about two weeks. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=37.0s)]
*  Two weeks for decisions on taxes, infrastructure, and what to do about ISIS in his first presidency. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=41.0s)]
*  Some of those deadlines were met, others were not. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=48.0s)]
*  In his second go-around, he recently gave Vladimir Putin two weeks to prove he was serious about ending the Ukraine war. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=50.0s)]
*  That deadline has come and gone. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=56.0s)]
*  And just last week, he said he'd be sending letters regarding new tariff rates to several countries in two weeks. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=58.0s)]
*  So the clock's still ticking on that one. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=64.0s)]
*  The world has held its breath this week, watching, waiting, wondering whether President Trump is serious and on the verge of directly attacking Iran and making a potentially legacy-shaping decision. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=66.0s)]
*  So is this just yet another two-week tease that peters out before the White House moves on to the next subject? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=75.0s)]
*  Time will tell. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=80.0s)]
*  We've only got about 14 days or 330 or so hours until we find out. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=81.0s)]
*  Debra Pata joins us now from Tel Aviv. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=86.0s)]
*  And as we turn to Debra, let's hear how the White House press secretary today announced this two-week timetable to the world. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=89.0s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=94.0s)]
*  Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=96.0s)]
*  I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=103.0s)]
*  Debra, how are the Israelis and the Iranians responding to Trump's two-week deadline? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=108.0s)]
*  Well, there will probably be a lot of senior Israeli government officials who are hoping for a decision more quickly than two weeks. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=114.0s)]
*  And once again today, you saw Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu almost baiting President Trump. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=124.0s)]
*  It's clear Israel wants a military response. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=130.0s)]
*  Let's listen to what Netanyahu had to say. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=133.0s)]
*  I gave them the chance to do it through negotiations. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=136.0s)]
*  They strung them along. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=140.0s)]
*  You don't string along Donald Trump. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=142.0s)]
*  He knows the game. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=145.0s)]
*  And I think that we're both committed to making sure that Iran will not have a nuclear weapon, and they won't. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=147.0s)]
*  Now, as for Iran, they have warned of serious consequences if the U.S. gets involved in this war. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=155.0s)]
*  But at the same time, Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, will meet with his counterparts from France, Germany, and the UK in another diplomatic push. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=163.0s)]
*  And we'll see how that goes on Friday. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=174.0s)]
*  Now, you're standing there in Tel Aviv, which of course is a major cosmopolitan city, a big tourist attraction for many around the world. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=178.0s)]
*  But how much damage are the Iranian strikes causing there in Tel Aviv and across Israel? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=184.0s)]
*  Well, the human cost of this war has escalated with at least 24 killed in Israel, but significantly higher in Iran, with rights groups putting the death toll there over 600. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=191.0s)]
*  Israel has a very sophisticated air defense system, but it is not invincible. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=203.0s)]
*  And some of those missiles break through. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=208.0s)]
*  Just today, we saw an Iranian missile hit a hospital in Beersheba. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=211.0s)]
*  There were minor injuries, as the patients and medical staff were all in bomb shelters, but serious damage to the old surgical unit. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=216.0s)]
*  And there is also a concern that Israel is tearing through its defenses weapons known as the arrow interceptors, which take out Iranian missiles two or three times a day. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=225.0s)]
*  All right. Well, we'll continue to monitor how the two countries attack each other. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=238.0s)]
*  Deborah Pata and our team there in Tel Aviv, thank you for now. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdLbuI3sxQ&t=244.0s)]
