# Trump reacts to Iran's retaliatory strikes in Qatar, calls attack a "weak response"
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ)
*  Sources tell CBS News Iran's retaliation was expected and calibrated. Now we're [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=0.0s)]
*  learning U.S. officials held meetings this weekend and this morning to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=5.68s)]
*  prepare for an attack on the U.S. airbase in Qatar. So let's bring in CBS [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=8.92s)]
*  News senior White House and political correspondent Edo Keith. And what do we [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=13.0s)]
*  know about the U.S. and its preparation for this attack? Clearly, how is it [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=17.72s)]
*  perceiving this retaliation also? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=22.56s)]
*  Well, Jules, just a few moments ago, the president himself on True Social laid [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=25.48s)]
*  out some of the details and his reaction to tonight's attacks on the U.S. military [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  base there in Qatar, writing on True Social, Iran has officially responded to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=35.68s)]
*  our obliteration of their nuclear facilities with what he calls a very [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  weak response, which we expected and had very effectively countered. He says there [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=42.84s)]
*  have been 14 missiles fired by Iran. 13 were knocked down and one was set free [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=47.44s)]
*  because it was headed in a non-threatening direction. He adds, I'm pleased to report [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=52.88s)]
*  that no Americans were harmed and hardly any damage was done. Most importantly, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=56.6s)]
*  they've gotten it all out of their system and there will hopefully be no [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  further hate, he says. I want to thank Iran for giving us this is important [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost and nobody to be [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=67.68s)]
*  injured. Perhaps Iran cannot proceed to peace and harmony in the region and I [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=71.36s)]
*  will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same. He adds in a subsequent [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=75.48s)]
*  truth social, congratulations world, it's time for peace. So what the president, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=80.08s)]
*  at least right now, is signaling perhaps is we did what we did over the weekend. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=85.12s)]
*  Iran has now responded in kind. Let's leave it at that and try to move on or [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=89.12s)]
*  try to get back to the negotiating table. He confirms a few details there. One, he [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=93.4s)]
*  says Iran gave someone a heads up that this was happening so the United States [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=97.42s)]
*  was prepared. Two, the number of missiles, we had heard some of that similar figures, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=103.12s)]
*  about 14 of them most missing the airbase. And then the fact that no Americans were [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=107.76s)]
*  killed, we did not have specific casualty figures yet. But we know now that yes, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=114.76s)]
*  over the weekend and into this morning, the president, his team were anticipating [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=120.52s)]
*  and preparing for this kind of retaliatory strike. You heard the speaker [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=124.44s)]
*  of the house a little while ago say he got a classified briefing this morning [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=127.84s)]
*  where the possibility of this was raised and the early indications came when [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=131.2s)]
*  cutter closed its airspace earlier today. That was a signal that they were [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=135.32s)]
*  anticipating something happening that could have potentially been far worse. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=139.48s)]
*  But at least for now, based on what the president is saying, 14 missiles, no [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=143.6s)]
*  American injuries and in his view and his hope, the world can move on. Yeah, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=148.28s)]
*  the latest information. Ed, thank you. Also, President Trump says the Iranian [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=153.2s)]
*  nuclear sites hit by U. S. Strikes were totally destroyed. Can we be certain [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=157.0s)]
*  that all of Iran's enriched uranium was at those sites when the strikes hit? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=162.2s)]
*  We cannot. And unless or until there is independent verification of that, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=169.4s)]
*  which there may never be, it's gonna be difficult to know for certain. And he's [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=174.24s)]
*  not happy about it. He's already blaming reporters or media outlets for [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=178.96s)]
*  suggesting that it might not have been there. He insists it was. Remember, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=182.4s)]
*  the Secretary of State Marco Rubio was asked over the weekend by Face the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=185.92s)]
*  Nations Margaret Brennan whether or not the U. S. Was certain it was all there. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  His response was we don't see how they could have possibly moved it in time [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=192.88s)]
*  and where they would have moved it to because Iran is under such heavy [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  surveillance by the Israelis and the Americans that any attempt to move [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=200.56s)]
*  something out of those facilities would have been seen and possibly dealt with [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=204.04s)]
*  sooner. But again, absent independent verification of some sort, it's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=206.84s)]
*  impossible to know whether all of it was was destroyed. Yeah. And it's [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  important to note you're in the Netherlands, where President Trump and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  his NATO counterparts will gather for a summit. So what's on the table and what [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  does the president hope to get out of it? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, we are still expecting him to leave early tomorrow morning [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=228.06s)]
*  Washington time and get here in time for dinner for meetings with leaders of the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  military alliance. The big item on the agenda is going to be an agreement [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=235.0s)]
*  amongst the member nations to increase their defense spending to about 5% of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=239.44s)]
*  their GDP. That would be actual military equipment and personnel, plus [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=243.76s)]
*  the infrastructure that's needed to support that. So roads, bridges, ports, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=248.88s)]
*  airports and other infrastructure that might be built in the country to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  support its military. The goal has been one of the president since his first [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=257.2s)]
*  term when he started berating NATO member nations for not paying more into [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=261.4s)]
*  the alliance so that the United States could start reducing its commitments [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=264.8s)]
*  only since his election last year and amid the war in Ukraine have several [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=268.18s)]
*  other member nations conceded it's time to start getting to as close to 5% GDP [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=273.08000000000004s)]
*  as possible. We don't know all the details, but the hope is to have most [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=277.16s)]
*  of those countries paying that much soon so that they boost their defense [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=280.44s)]
*  spending and in least the view of the president, they can back off American [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=283.72s)]
*  forces and equipment here. The NATO secretary general basically telling [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  member nations you've got about five years to start spending that much money [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  on your own defense because it could take Russia that long to prepare for a [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=296.32000000000005s)]
*  major war across Europe. Ed O'Keefe, Ed, thank you so much. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCMYj0gBAQ&t=300.32s)]
