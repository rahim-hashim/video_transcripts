# Israeli air strikes rock Beirut, targeting alleged Hezbollah command center
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU)
*  Now to the Middle East. Israel carried out a series of airstrikes Friday targeting Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=0.0s)]
*  At least two people were killed and dozens wounded. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=6.0s)]
*  A Pentagon spokesperson says the U.S. had no advance warning of this strike. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=9.0s)]
*  On Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Secretary of State for the United States Antony Blinken [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=13.0s)]
*  both addressed the situation during the United Nations General Assembly. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=19.0s)]
*  As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice and Israel has every right [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=23.0s)]
*  to remove this threat and return our citizens to their homes safely. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=30.0s)]
*  We'll continue degrading Hezbollah until all our objectives are made. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=34.0s)]
*  It's clearly in the interests of the Lebanese people to have peace, to have security, to have stability, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=41.0s)]
*  to not live under threat and certainly in their interest to avoid a wider war where the inevitably [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=50.0s)]
*  the biggest victim of such a war, those who would suffer the most are the Lebanese people. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=56.0s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent M.T.S. Tayeb is following the latest. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=62.0s)]
*  M.T.S. what's the situation like there in Beirut? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=66.0s)]
*  Well shortly after the Israeli military warned residents of the same Beirut neighborhood, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=69.0s)]
*  it targeted in its massive strikes tonight to evacuate, including those who live in three specific buildings. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=74.0s)]
*  Those strikes have now started. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=80.0s)]
*  Now these strikes of course follow that enormous raid by Israeli fighter jets in the Dahya neighborhood [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=82.0s)]
*  in which we saw massive explosions and of course the aftermath in which buildings were pulverized [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=88.0s)]
*  and a massive crater was left in the middle of what was once a busy residential street. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=94.0s)]
*  Now there are reports that the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, may have been at the site, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=101.0s)]
*  Israel saying that that was their target, but we received no independent confirmation that he was there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=108.0s)]
*  But tonight the White House has said that President Biden has told the Pentagon to quote, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=114.0s)]
*  assess and adjust U.S. forces as needed across the Middle East. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=118.0s)]
*  He's also telling his team to make sure that American embassies here in the region are taking protective measures. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=122.0s)]
*  Lana. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=128.0s)]
*  Alright, MTA, Tahya, the Beirut, thank you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJZqIWSOWU&t=129.0s)]
