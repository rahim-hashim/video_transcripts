# Trump appears optimistic about Israel-Hamas ceasefire progress
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY)
*  President Trump is ramping up his push for an end to the conflict between Israel and Hamas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=0.0s)]
*  He met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House last night to discuss next steps in ceasefire negotiations [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=5.28s)]
*  The recent US attack on Iran was also on the agenda [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=12.66s)]
*  We've got team coverage on this for you this morning CBS News senior foreign correspondent [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=16.2s)]
*  Elizabeth Palmer is in Tel Aviv with the response from Israel [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=20.76s)]
*  But let's begin at the White House with our chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes Nancy [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=23.78s)]
*  Good morning to you. Tell us what what came of last night's meeting [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=28.3s)]
*  Errol good morning. Good to see you [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=33.58s)]
*  well [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=35.18s)]
*  This meeting was key because President Trump says that he believes that a ceasefire can finally be reached [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=35.660000000000004s)]
*  This week and talks continue in Doha and Qatar this week as all sides try to make that happen [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  And so that's that was at the top of the agenda last night when he was meeting with Prime Minister [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=49.78s)]
*  Netanyahu who will be sitting down with the House Speaker today and other [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=55.339999999999996s)]
*  Officials here in Washington. We know that a framework for a proposal exists and according to an official who has [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=59.62s)]
*  Viewed that proposal and is familiar with it. It's very specific. It would involve a 60-day ceasefire [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=68.06s)]
*  during which time [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=74.74s)]
*  10 Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas would be released [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=76.25999999999999s)]
*  As well as some bodies of hostages that were killed [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=82.12s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners would be released by the Israelis as well [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=86.96s)]
*  Hostilities would obviously be put on hold with some Israeli troops coming out of Gaza as the two sides work to try to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=91.72s)]
*  Get through some of these very very thorny issues that have always [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=101.4s)]
*  Made it difficult to reach a more permanent solution [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=104.92s)]
*  Involving the future of Hamas the future of Gaza and all the rest [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=109.84s)]
*  And so that is what the the White House very much wants to see happen this week Steve Whitcoff [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=114.56s)]
*  the president's Middle East envoy is heading to Qatar to try to make that happen, but [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=120.4s)]
*  President Trump has said many times before that he thinks that this side all sides are close and then nothing has come of it [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  So we'll see if they're able to reach a breakthrough this time around Errol. Yeah. Yeah, very good point [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=132.34s)]
*  Nancy called us at the White House for us Nancy. Thank you [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=136.86s)]
*  We want to jump over now to CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer in Tel Aviv Elizabeth. Good morning to you [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=139.18s)]
*  You know yesterday I was speaking with the parent of an Israeli hostage who had [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=145.54s)]
*  Encouraging words for the president almost compliments saying only you can get this done and sounded more [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=151.3s)]
*  Critical of the Israeli Prime Minister saying it's your responsibility to make sure these hostages come home [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=156.42000000000002s)]
*  So what is the reaction domestically to this White House meeting yesterday? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=161.96s)]
*  Well, there is hope as Nancy said we've been here before close but not close enough [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=170.16s)]
*  So people are cautiously hopeful, but there's no question the country wants this war to end or the overwhelming majority [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  And to see the hostages come home. That's what it's all about here in Israel [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=183.32s)]
*  Nancy mentioned that 10 hostages will be released in the 60-day ceasefire according to this draft proposal [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=188.98s)]
*  That's only half of the ones that are left. There are 20 living ones believed to be [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=196.1s)]
*  Still in captivity more than 600 days now [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=202.26s)]
*  And so there are families all over this country who are braced for the bitter disappointment of discovering that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=205.38s)]
*  Their loved one won't make it on this list [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=211.98s)]
*  However, it will be seen as a step toward some kind of lasting stability and that's a net plus and what might this mean? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=215.45999999999998s)]
*  For the future of civilians in Gaza, they remain under [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=224.05999999999997s)]
*  dire humanitarian straits [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=228.77999999999997s)]
*  That is the biggest and most insoluble problem [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=234.38s)]
*  In the 60 days obviously there'll be a flood of aid that would come in under the terms of this ceasefire [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=240.26s)]
*  They would be able to relax sleep properly for the first time in more than a year and a half [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=245.42s)]
*  But the really tough thing is to come up with a roadmap for the day after the end of the 60 days and that's where [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=250.85999999999999s)]
*  Hamas in Israel appear to be very far apart Hamas [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=257.78s)]
*  wants Israel to commit to not restarting the war at the end of the ceasefire which has happened before as you recall and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=260.94s)]
*  Israel just does not want to make that commitment [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=268.34s)]
*  Approaching 250 in the afternoon there in Tel Aviv Elizabeth Palmer with the latest for us this. Thank you [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR3EMp5h1bY&t=272.78s)]
