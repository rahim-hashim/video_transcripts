# Israel has not come close to destroying Hamas, U.S. official says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw)
*  A U.S. official tells CBS News the Israelis, quote, haven't come close to achieving their [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=0.0s)]
*  objective of destroying Hamas. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=6.36s)]
*  And they criticized Israel's current strategy as, quote, a recipe for continuous war. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=8.44s)]
*  These comments come a day after the Israeli military's top spokesperson said that Hamas [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=14.72s)]
*  cannot be destroyed and that Netanyahu's government must find an alternative to the militant group [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=21.12s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=27.68s)]
*  For CBS News, chief foreign affairs correspondent and Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=28.68s)]
*  joins me now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=33.16s)]
*  Margaret, great to see you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=34.16s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=35.16s)]
*  So, let's talk about Netanyahu. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=36.16s)]
*  His top advisors met with Biden's top advisors, Jake Sullivan, of course, and Antony Blinken. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=39.04s)]
*  How is the Biden administration assessing all of this? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=46.8s)]
*  Do they have any indications? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  Are they giving any indications that an end to this war may be in sight? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  U.S. officials have been pressing Benjamin Netanyahu for an answer to the question of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=56.64s)]
*  what comes next since October. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=60.44s)]
*  And so now you're just hearing that frustration spill out into the public space, not just [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=64.46000000000001s)]
*  from U.S. officials, by the way, also from Benny Gantz, member of the War Cabinet, who [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=68.16s)]
*  resigned because he said that the prime minister failed to describe anything other than perpetual [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=72.72s)]
*  war. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=78.12s)]
*  And he didn't come up with a plan for the day after. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=79.4s)]
*  The defense minister stood up and said, tell me who's going to run this place, because [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=81.48s)]
*  a military occupation wasn't something that the Israeli military, and you heard the military [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=85.72000000000001s)]
*  spokesperson reflect that sentiment as well. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  That defense minister is expected here in Washington next week. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=92.74000000000001s)]
*  So this frustration really is spilling over, and it matters in terms of the assessment [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=96.58000000000001s)]
*  of success. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=100.84s)]
*  Like, how do you defeat and destroy Hamas? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=101.84s)]
*  Netanyahu's never directly answered that question in terms of what the Biden administration [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  had been looking for. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  No specifics of who comes in and runs that gate, who comes in and administers the aid. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=110.42000000000002s)]
*  Do you want a full occupation? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=116.4s)]
*  Because the far right of his coalition government does argue for that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=118.48s)]
*  And if he doesn't want it, then he should say that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=122.48s)]
*  But you also have the secretary of state spinning his wheels, traveling the globe with other [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=125.8s)]
*  Arab leaders, with other world leaders talking about how to pay for and plan for the 25-mile [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=130.08s)]
*  strip that is Gaza. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=135.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=137.12s)]
*  And at the same time, you also have, you know, everything going on possibly with Lebanon. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=138.12s)]
*  I mean, Israel's military has approved a plan for a possible invasion into Lebanon. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=144.12s)]
*  What exactly are they preparing for? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=149.96s)]
*  What are the conditions there? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=151.36s)]
*  And again, I mean, the Biden administration, another example of them trying to ease those [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=153.88000000000002s)]
*  tensions, obviously a lot for Antony Blinken. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=158.12s)]
*  There's extreme concern within the Biden administration right now about where we are in the possibility [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=160.52s)]
*  of this new front really becoming explosive. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=166.44s)]
*  And this is the showdown that the U.S. had been fearful of because Hezbollah is really [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=169.56s)]
*  the strongest paramilitary group backed by Iran. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  They put some of those smaller militias to shame, the ones who attack our service people [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=180.88s)]
*  in Syria and Iraq. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=184.84s)]
*  Hezbollah has incredible weaponry and has prepared for a war with Israel. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  Israel has prepared for a war with Hezbollah for years, not like the surprise attack we [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=191.36s)]
*  just saw with Hamas. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=195.94s)]
*  So the U.S. has been trying to slow roll this for some time. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=197.72s)]
*  Back in October, President Biden did get Netanyahu to hold back on launching that front and launched [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=201.48s)]
*  his envoy, Amos Hoxdeen, to go try to do this diplomatic agreement to establish a border, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=207.98s)]
*  to establish a buffer zone, because after October 7th, when the rocket attack started [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=212.46s)]
*  picking up with Hezbollah, they basically cleared out southern Lebanon and northern [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=216.46s)]
*  Israel. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=222.72s)]
*  People have been displaced. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=223.72s)]
*  They haven't been able to go home. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=224.72s)]
*  That's a political problem. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=225.72s)]
*  So the idea was through a negotiation, you could carve out that buffer zone. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=226.72s)]
*  But now those talks haven't achieved what the Israeli government had been looking for. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=232.28s)]
*  And the Lebanese government is extremely weak. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=237.92s)]
*  So it's the U.S. trying to be the midwife to find a way other than a full-on assault. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=240.28s)]
*  And we have the defense minister coming here from Israel next week to meet at the Pentagon. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=246.72s)]
*  And this is going to be a big part of that conversation. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=251.78s)]
*  the envoy flying back and forth, really trying to lower the tension and avoid this by brokering [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=254.96s)]
*  a deal. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=260.90000000000003s)]
*  And the U.S. doesn't talk directly to Hezbollah. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=261.90000000000003s)]
*  They have to talk to the emissary. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=263.32s)]
*  This is complicated stuff. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=265.32s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=266.68s)]
*  You kind of need a map to figure out where everybody is location-wise. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=267.68s)]
*  And obviously, Netanyahu is expected to come here next month. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=271.96000000000004s)]
*  So a lot to look forward to there. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=275.92s)]
*  I want to move over. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=277.44s)]
*  And U.S. officials have said, don't come unless you have a plan for the day after. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=278.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=281.12s)]
*  Some Democrats saying that they're going to boycott it altogether. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=282.68s)]
*  Obviously, a lot of politics for them there. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=284.8s)]
*  Let's move over to Ukraine, because the U.S. announced today that it's redirecting all [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=288.12s)]
*  of its orders for these patriot air defense systems to Ukraine. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=292.96s)]
*  What kind of impact would this make in the war, if any? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=298.54s)]
*  Well, you've had President Zelensky say he needs to be able to defend cities. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=302.48s)]
*  He specifically wanted seven patriots. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=307.24s)]
*  And if you remember at that press conference, he stood next to President Biden, and President [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=309.96s)]
*  Biden said, I'll get you. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=313.44s)]
*  They're coming. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  And that they had plans for about five at that point. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=317.28s)]
*  What the U.S. just did, because the U.S. is a supplier to so many countries who buy weapons [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=319.47999999999996s)]
*  made here, is say they jump to the front of the line. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  So they're going to get the things you ordered. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=328.67999999999995s)]
*  We'll make it back to you. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=331.0s)]
*  But it's the interceptors for these patriots, which help knock down incoming, particularly [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=332.46s)]
*  civilian cities. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=337.88000000000005s)]
*  Kharkiv right now is one of the places that they're most concerned about. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=338.88000000000005s)]
*  But to put them in other areas as well to defend, by the way, at times the civilian [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=343.26000000000005s)]
*  population because Russia continues to target civilian areas. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=348.68s)]
*  So this is another way instead of gifting money or weapons, it is saying here, we'll [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=353.36s)]
*  give you what you need. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=358.6s)]
*  And they carved out some of the countries and I should say customers who don't have [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=359.8s)]
*  to wait. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=365.38s)]
*  Taiwan, for example, gets to continue to receive these patriot interceptors because they need [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=367.78s)]
*  them as well with the possible aggression from China. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=373.58s)]
*  Yeah, a lot to get to. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=376.42s)]
*  We didn't even get to Putin's tour of Asia. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=377.65999999999997s)]
*  There's a lot going on here. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=380.65999999999997s)]
*  So we will look forward to your show coming up on Sunday. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=382.65999999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much, Margaret. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=385.9s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he9-cfFpGVw&t=386.9s)]
