# Israeli military begins ground operation in southern Lebanon
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0)
*  Israel's military says it has started a limited ground incursion in southern Lebanon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=0.0s)]
*  The operation comes days after an Israeli airstrike killed the leader of the Iran-invaded [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=5.08s)]
*  militant group Hezbollah. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  The Pentagon says it's positioning a few thousand additional forces in the region to defend [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=11.92s)]
*  U.S. interests at a moment's notice. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=17.48s)]
*  Earlier Monday, Israel struck central Beirut for the first time in almost a year. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=20.64s)]
*  President Biden has called for de-escalation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=24.48s)]
*  But in a video statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested the fight was [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=27.46s)]
*  far from over and that his focus would shift to Iran. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=36.46s)]
*  There's nowhere we will not go to protect our people and protect our country. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=40.260000000000005s)]
*  The people of Iran should know Israel stands with you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=44.7s)]
*  May we together know a future of prosperity and peace. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=48.900000000000006s)]
*  Let's bring in Andrew Boyd. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=54.4s)]
*  He's the former chief of operations at the CIA's Counterterrorism Mission Center and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=56.4s)]
*  a CBS News contributor. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=60.48s)]
*  So what is your assessment of Israel's ultimate goal when you see the look on the face of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=62.8s)]
*  the world? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=68.24s)]
*  What is your assessment of Israel's ultimate goal when you see the look on the face of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=69.24s)]
*  the world? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=72.24s)]
*  Well, I think the first thing is to see the future of Israel. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=73.24s)]
*  The future of Israel is not just a future of the world. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=76.24s)]
*  So what is your assessment of Israel's ultimate goal when you see the latest moves they've [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=80.08s)]
*  been taking? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  Good evening, John. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  I mean, their ultimate goals are to eliminate Hezbollah as a threat to northern Israel or [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  to Israel at large, to destroy the threat posed by Hamas since October 7th, and I believe [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=93.72s)]
*  to deter Iran from taking action that, retaliatory or otherwise, that would be destabilizing [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=100.16s)]
*  to the entire region, obviously, but a grave threat to Israel. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=106.52s)]
*  And I think their final strategic goal is once they've eliminated these threats, to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=110.88s)]
*  develop productive economic relationships with the rest of the Arab world, which prior [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=115.96s)]
*  to the October 7th attacks from Hamas, they were doing with the Saudis, with the Emiratis [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=120.84s)]
*  and others. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=125.8s)]
*  Do you think, Andrew, that's possible given what Israel has done? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=126.8s)]
*  There used to be, you know, during the Bush administration and even before, discussion [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=131.52s)]
*  about the Arab street, the idea that the Arab anger over Israeli treatment of Palestinians [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=136.56s)]
*  would make it very difficult for other nations to work with Israel. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=143.44s)]
*  Isn't that anger going to be increased by the recent activity and make those kinds of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  arrangements more difficult? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=150.24s)]
*  I doubt there was a tear shed in any of these Sunni Arab capitals after the death of Hassan [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=152.52s)]
*  Nasrallah and the decapitation of the leadership of his bloc. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=158.32s)]
*  The Saudis and others in the Sunni Arab world want to have some rapprochement with the Iranians. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  So yes, that's an issue. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=170.6s)]
*  But as soon as Hamas is eliminated as a military threat, I do think that the Arab street, so [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=172.88s)]
*  to speak, will then be able to move on beyond that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  Yes, there's going to be quite a bit of rebuilding. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=182.04s)]
*  There's a lot of mistrust between the Arab world and the Israelis. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=184.28s)]
*  But ultimately, the Israelis want to have economic relations with the Saudis, the Emiratis [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=188.14s)]
*  and the rest of the Arab world. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=193.17999999999998s)]
*  And I think that benefits their street as well. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=194.67999999999998s)]
*  How do you assess the U.S. position with respect to Israel? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=197.7s)]
*  It's been pushing ahead despite the calls from President Biden for de-escalation. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=201.7s)]
*  Is there a disconnect or are Israel's actions consistent with U.S. national security goals, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=205.73999999999998s)]
*  even though a president might not be able to say that? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=214.27999999999997s)]
*  I think it's mixed. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=217.86s)]
*  I mean, the United States has global security responsibilities. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=219.58s)]
*  The Israelis do not have that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=222.96s)]
*  So I understand why the White House is looking for a ceasefire, a negotiated settlement. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=224.70000000000002s)]
*  But I really think that all politics being local, I don't think that's really practical [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  in Israel currently. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=236.02s)]
*  The overwhelming majority of Israeli citizens want external threats to be eliminated. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=237.98000000000002s)]
*  100,000 Israelis who had to move out of northern Israel because of the threat from Hezbollah [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=243.74s)]
*  want to go back to their homes. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=248.46s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu, who leads a fairly extreme government, but I believe that any [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=250.9s)]
*  prime minister who is in power on October 7th and beyond would be following basically [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=256.94s)]
*  the same tactical and strategic principles because the overwhelming majority of Israeli [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=262.02s)]
*  citizens demand it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=267.54s)]
*  How should we understand the death of Hezbollah's leadership in terms of that group's ability [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=271.02000000000004s)]
*  to operate, how much of a blow that is, and how much Israel may have the upper hand now? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=277.66s)]
*  I mean, I think it's a massive blow. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=284.54s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah for 32 years has been the general secretary of Hezbollah. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=286.26s)]
*  He's a political leader, a religious leader. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=290.38s)]
*  I mean, frankly, was an inspiration to the Shia population. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=293.26s)]
*  There were pivot points that degraded their credibility starting on February 14th, 2005, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=299.3s)]
*  when Hezbollah colluded with the Syrians to assassinate Prime Minister Rafiq Kariri. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=305.82s)]
*  I don't think Hezbollah has ever been looked upon the same, and there's been a great deal [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=310.42s)]
*  of distrust. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=314.06s)]
*  But he was probably the most credible Arab leader in the region. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=315.58s)]
*  Their command and control has been decimated. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=324.22s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah, Ali Karki, and Hulbert Fawad Shukr earlier this summer, they do not have [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=326.58s)]
*  a command and control mechanism that they had previously, which also means they don't [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=331.82s)]
*  have constraints. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=335.90000000000003s)]
*  There are probably mid-level Hezbollah leaders. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=336.90000000000003s)]
*  Hezbollah is a wounded animal. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=339.54s)]
*  Wounded animals can be dangerous. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=341.9s)]
*  Those mid-level leaders may be trying to make a name for themselves. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=343.38s)]
*  They still have ballistic missiles. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=347.26s)]
*  So it's a very dangerous time with Hezbollah. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=348.82s)]
*  So I understand why the Israelis are looking for a ground incursion and are continuing [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=350.78s)]
*  their repeated airstrikes around Lebanon. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=355.61999999999995s)]
*  Andrew Boyd, thank you so much. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYtzCyFBND0&t=358.65999999999997s)]
