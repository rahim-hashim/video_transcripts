# Witkoff calls Hamas response to ceasefire "totally unacceptable"
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LOSb-YAY)
*  Negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire deal continue as the desperation for humanitarian aid grows. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LOSb-YAY&t=0.0s)]
*  Our Imtiaz Tayeb has the latest. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LOSb-YAY&t=6.0s)]
*  Gaza's Nasser hospital, overrun with casualties after Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinians on their way to an aid distribution point in the southern city of Rafa. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LOSb-YAY&t=10.0s)]
*  Health officials say at least 49 people were killed and over 200 wounded, many suffering from gunshot injuries. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LOSb-YAY&t=22.0s)]
*  This man's brother was killed as he waited to collect a food parcel. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LOSb-YAY&t=29.0s)]
*  This is wrong, he says. Let the whole world see this. See what the Israelis and the Americans are doing to us. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LOSb-YAY&t=36.0s)]
*  They're lying to us. They say humanitarian aid, but then they kill us. Why? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LOSb-YAY&t=42.0s)]
*  Palestinians say Israeli forces have repeatedly opened fire at aid distribution points run by the US and Israeli backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LOSb-YAY&t=47.0s)]
*  An allegation Israel denies. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LOSb-YAY&t=57.0s)]
*  GHF, which didn't exist a few months ago, is staffed with heavily armed American contractors. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LOSb-YAY&t=61.0s)]
*  The UN and other aid agencies have refused to work with the group, saying it has, quote, militarized aid, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LOSb-YAY&t=67.0s)]
*  which goes against all humanitarian principles as innocent Palestinians continue to pay the ultimate price. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LOSb-YAY&t=74.0s)]
*  This video is a five year old Ward El Sheikh Khalil from a week ago as she escaped the flames that engulfed the UN school her family was sheltering in. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LOSb-YAY&t=81.0s)]
*  She survived, but her mother, brothers and sisters were all killed in the Israeli strike. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LOSb-YAY&t=90.0s)]
*  Asked what happened, Ward broke down. A rocket fell on them, she said, and they died. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LOSb-YAY&t=95.0s)]
*  And earlier we spoke with Ward's uncle, Iyad, to see how she was doing, and he told us she keeps asking for her mother and that she is in serious need of psychological support, something not available to her or most children in Gaza. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LOSb-YAY&t=102.0s)]
*  In Tiaz Tayyab in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LOSb-YAY&t=117.0s)]
