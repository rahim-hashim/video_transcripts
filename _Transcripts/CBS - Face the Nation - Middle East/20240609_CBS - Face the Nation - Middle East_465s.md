# NSA Jake Sullivan says "we could have a cease-fire tomorrow" if Hamas agrees
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I)
*  President Biden will be returning from his visit to France today, and it'll be a quick [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=0.0s)]
*  turnaround as he'll return to Italy for a Group of Seven meeting with America's top [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=4.88s)]
*  allies later this week. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=9.92s)]
*  At the top of the agenda for both trips, the two ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine, as well [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=12.24s)]
*  as how to handle aggression from the countries not represented at that meeting, Russia and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=19.2s)]
*  China. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  We spoke with President Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan earlier today and began [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  by asking him about the Israeli hostage rescue and whether military operations are the way [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=30.0s)]
*  to free the remaining that are still held captive. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=35.44s)]
*  By far the most effective, certain and right way to get all of the hostages out is to get [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  a comprehensive ceasefire and hostage deal that President Biden described in public a [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=46.72s)]
*  few days ago that Israel has accepted and now that we are awaiting Hamas to respond [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=52.36s)]
*  to. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=57.24s)]
*  Jake, I know the U.S. provided intelligence support to this military operation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=58.24s)]
*  Are you at all concerned that it will imperil the chances at that diplomatic agreement? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=62.28s)]
*  And is there an expiration date by which Yahya Sainoar has to respond to this offer? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=67.88s)]
*  It's a fair question, Margaret. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=75.16s)]
*  What will Hamas do in terms of its calculus on this deal following this operation? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=76.56s)]
*  And I, of course, cannot put myself in the head of a Hamas terrorist. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=81.64s)]
*  But the fact is that the whole world is looking to Hamas to say yes, because for all those [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=86.2s)]
*  people, for all these months who have been calling for a ceasefire, now is the moment. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=91.08s)]
*  There could be a ceasefire tomorrow, today even, if Hamas would say yes to the deal. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=95.12s)]
*  So from our perspective, the world needs to continue to reinforce that message quite clearly [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=99.64s)]
*  and strongly. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=104.4s)]
*  We have not gotten an official response yet from Hamas. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=105.52s)]
*  We're waiting for one. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=109.36s)]
*  We're waiting to hear from the Qataris and the Egyptians who are the mediators in communication [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=110.6s)]
*  and we will continue to reinforce the message, take the deal until we get that answer. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=115.18s)]
*  Jake, I was looking back at remarks you made on this program just a week after that horrific [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=120.42s)]
*  attack on Israel on October 7th. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=125.14s)]
*  And even in the early days, you were pressing the Israeli government for a clear plan on [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=127.66000000000001s)]
*  what they will do in Gaza the day after the war ends. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=133.82s)]
*  Has Netanyahu accepted any of the U.S. proposals or suggestions? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=138.26s)]
*  Has he presented any of it to his own war cabinet? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=143.02s)]
*  We do have a detailed discussion with our Israeli counterparts about the day after. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=147.34s)]
*  But we also have been clear, as you said from the very beginning, that a military strategy [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=152.02s)]
*  to defeat a terrorist group has got to be connected to a political and humanitarian [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=157.46s)]
*  strategy and a logical strategic endgame. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=161.66000000000003s)]
*  And too often over the course of this conflict, we have not seen that clear connection and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=164.98000000000002s)]
*  we have continued to reinforce the need for Israel to bear down, to ensure that it has [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=169.18s)]
*  a holistic strategy to ensure the enduring defeat of Hamas and to ensure a better day [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  of peace and stability for Israelis and Palestinians alike. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=179.5s)]
*  So it sounds like no agreement on that as yet. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=182.66s)]
*  President Biden gave an interview to Time magazine that was published this past week [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=186.58s)]
*  and he was asked whether he's seen evidence of Israeli war crimes in Gaza. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=190.54000000000002s)]
*  He said the answer is it's uncertain and has been investigated by the Israelis themselves. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=194.74s)]
*  He dismissed the idea Israel was starving people as part of its war strategy, but he [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=200.22s)]
*  also said, I think they've engaged in activity that is inappropriate. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=205.06s)]
*  What would you say is inappropriate? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=209.74s)]
*  Well actually, Margaret, a couple of weeks ago, the State Department put out a comprehensive [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  report that didn't just speak in generalities. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=216.22s)]
*  It went into specific incidents that raised real concerns. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=219.14000000000001s)]
*  It was inconclusive, which is what the Secretary of State said on this program at that time. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=222.10000000000002s)]
*  Right, and it's exactly what the president said as well when he was asked the question. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=226.78s)]
*  We do not have enough information to reach definitive conclusions about particular incidents [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=230.78s)]
*  or to make legal determinations, but we do have enough information to have concern, more [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=236.34s)]
*  than concern. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=241.5s)]
*  Our hearts break about the loss of innocent Palestinian life. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=243.02s)]
*  The president himself has said publicly that Palestinians, innocent Palestinians are going [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=247.38s)]
*  through sheer hell in this conflict. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=251.82s)]
*  And a lot of that is because Hamas has put them in an impossible situation. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=254.45999999999998s)]
*  Hamas hides among the civilian population, holds hostages among the civilian population, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=259.42s)]
*  fires at the IDF from behind the civilian population. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=265.46s)]
*  And so yes, we have asked Israel to take steps to be more precise and targeted in its military [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=269.5s)]
*  operations. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=274.78s)]
*  But there is only one answer to all of this, and it's the answer I keep coming back to, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=275.78s)]
*  which is a ceasefire and hostage deal that would end the suffering, end the conflict, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=280.42s)]
*  end the war and bring all of the hostages home. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=285.62s)]
*  The president recently approved allowing Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weapons to fire across [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=289.14000000000004s)]
*  the Russian border, a restricted area, but still a new policy choice here. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=294.54s)]
*  Has that made a difference on the battlefield? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=300.22s)]
*  From the president's perspective, this was common sense. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=303.46000000000004s)]
*  What was happening up around Kharkiv, which was new just in the last couple of months, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=307.28s)]
*  was a Russian offensive where they were moving from one side of the border directly to the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=311.64s)]
*  other side of the border. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=315.64s)]
*  And it simply didn't make sense not to allow the Ukrainians to fire across that border [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  to hit Russian guns and emplacements that were firing at the Ukrainians. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=322.55999999999995s)]
*  So the president authorized that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=327.29999999999995s)]
*  The Ukrainians have carried out that authorization on the battlefield. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=329.55999999999995s)]
*  And one thing I will point out is that the momentum of that operation in Kharkiv has [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=333.52s)]
*  stalled out. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=338.29999999999995s)]
*  Now, Kharkiv is still under threat, but the Russians have not been able to make material [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=339.52s)]
*  progress on the ground in recent days in that area, and the United States will continue [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=344.06s)]
*  to support Ukraine in holding the line and pushing back against the aggressing Russian [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=348.2s)]
*  forces. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=352.06s)]
*  Well, as you know, Vladimir Putin said in response to that that Russia has the option [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=353.06s)]
*  to arm Western adversaries in response. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=358.96s)]
*  One of your top aides here in Washington on Friday gave a pretty notable speech, Jake, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=363.72s)]
*  in which he said the U.S. may need to soon increase its stockpile of strategic nuclear [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=368.04s)]
*  weapons given the expanding arsenals of America's adversaries. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=374.9s)]
*  Have you seen evidence that Russia, China, North Korea and Iran are sharing nuclear technology [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=380.18s)]
*  at this point? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=386.16s)]
*  And what would trigger President Biden to make that decision? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=387.64s)]
*  Well, Margaret, I can't speak to intelligence matters, especially highly sensitive intelligence [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=392.12s)]
*  matters relative to nuclear capability. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=398.76s)]
*  But what I can say is that we are concerned. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=402.42s)]
*  We are concerned about cooperation among the countries you just mentioned, and we are concerned [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=404.42s)]
*  about the advancing nuclear arsenals of countries like China and Russia, as well as North Korea. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=410.14s)]
*  This is something that we are focused on, we are looking hard at, and we will consult [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=415.92s)]
*  with our allies and partners on the best way forward to ensure a safe, reliable, incredible [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=420.42s)]
*  nuclear deterrent by the United States. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=425.82s)]
*  We've taken no decisions. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=428.06s)]
*  We will monitor the situation closely. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=429.74s)]
*  Is this because China has brushed off your attempts at arms control? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=432.22s)]
*  Well, actually, Margaret, in the last few months, China has showed a greater willingness, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=436.3s)]
*  not a lower willingness, to engage with us on questions related to proliferation and [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=441.38s)]
*  arms control. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=445.94s)]
*  Those are nascent conversations. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=447.02000000000004s)]
*  They're nothing like the kinds of intense arms control negotiations that we had with [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=448.7s)]
*  the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War or Russia in the post-Cold War era. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=453.58s)]
*  But it's the beginning of a dialogue. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=457.7s)]
*  Jake Sullivan, thank you very much for joining us from Paris. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=459.42s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo6DFa4j32I&t=463.62s)]
