# Israeli strike hits Gaza school housing displaced Palestinians
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME)
*  Dozens of Palestinians were reportedly killed in another Israeli airstrike. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=0.0s)]
*  The Israeli military claims it was conducting a, quote, precision strike on a Hamas compound. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=5.0s)]
*  The attack hit a United Nations school in central Gaza that was housing displaced Palestinians. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=10.0s)]
*  Israel claims, but hasn't shown any evidence that Hamas was operating out of the building. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=15.0s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Chris Livesey joins us now from Tel Aviv with more on this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=20.0s)]
*  Chris, it's yet another strike by the IDF that seems to have killed civilians. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=25.0s)]
*  What more do we know about this strike specifically? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=30.0s)]
*  Elan and Errol, well, the Israel Defense Forces are saying they were targeting dozens of fighters from both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=35.0s)]
*  two primary groups who carried off the October 7 massacre right here in Israel. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=44.0s)]
*  In fact, they say that there were members of those they were targeting inside of this compound who did directly participate in the October 7 attack. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=48.0s)]
*  Now, this compound happened to be inside of a UN school where we know thousands of civilians had been sheltering. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=57.0s)]
*  Israel, of course, emphasizing that they were in a separate part of this compound where there were not any civilians, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=64.0s)]
*  those that they were targeting, those being fighters, you know, separate away from the civilians. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=71.0s)]
*  However, CBS film crew inside Gaza was shown wounded after this attack in a hospital, and among those wounded and dead, they saw were civilians, including children. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=76.0s)]
*  And Chris, as everybody hopes for peace, I want to ask you about the latest on the ceasefire proposal. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=87.0s)]
*  Hamas has responded. What are they saying? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=95.0s)]
*  That's right. So the leader of Hamas responding now saying that they want to have a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces as part of this ceasefire deal that would lead to the release of hostages. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=99.0s)]
*  So that's dealing a blow to the plan that was laid out by President Biden in the end of last week. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=113.0s)]
*  Israel has seen that as a nonstarter since the beginning of these negotiations. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=121.0s)]
*  The idea that they would essentially wave the white flag and bring an end to this war in order to see the release of a hostage. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=127.0s)]
*  Israel sees the war as being the primary instrument of pressure that it can apply to Hamas in order to lead to the release of these hostages. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=134.0s)]
*  However, behind closed doors, we're told that Doha, Doha having been a major interlocutor in these negotiation processes, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=144.0s)]
*  Doha is telling CBS News that both sides do remain broadly in agreement to the terms of this ceasefire. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=151.0s)]
*  So there appear to be reasons to be optimistic that a ceasefire can be reached. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=160.0s)]
*  All right, Chris, let's say with the latest. Thank you very much. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0O38v0BMME&t=166.0s)]
