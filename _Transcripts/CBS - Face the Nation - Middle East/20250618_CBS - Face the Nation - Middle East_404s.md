# Iranians do not respond well to threats, Iran's Supreme Leader says in response to Trump
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE)
*  I told you things in the Middle East remain very newsmaking. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=0.0s)]
*  Remarks from the president today saying nobody knows what he's going to do. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=4.0s)]
*  There is a sense in the region that the United States might get more involved in the conflict [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=8.4s)]
*  between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=12.96s)]
*  For perspective on all that, I want to go to Holly Williams, who comes to us from Northern [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=14.96s)]
*  Iraq. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=18.72s)]
*  President Trump has called for Iran's unconditional surrender. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=21.2s)]
*  And today we had a response to that in a televised address by Iran's supreme leader. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=24.66s)]
*  The Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=29.9s)]
*  His tone was bellicose, as you might expect from the Iranian leader with his country under [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=32.14s)]
*  bombardment. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=37.339999999999996s)]
*  He said that Iranians do not respond well to the language of threats. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=38.379999999999995s)]
*  He was defiant. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=42.82s)]
*  He vowed that Iran would never surrender to coercion. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=43.94s)]
*  And perhaps most pertinently for Americans, he said that any US military intervention [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=47.34s)]
*  will quote, undoubtedly result in irreparable damage to them. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=52.459999999999994s)]
*  Now, Iran has already accused the US of being complicit in Israel's attack and has threatened [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=56.98s)]
*  to retaliate against American military bases. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=62.26s)]
*  There are many US bases here in the Middle East, along with around 40,000 American troops. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=65.46s)]
*  But perhaps the most obvious target for an Iranian retaliation would be the roughly 2,500 [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=71.12s)]
*  US troops here in Iraq, simply because they are right next door to Iran. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=76.34s)]
*  If the US does get directly involved in this conflict and if Iran then chooses to retaliate, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=82.44s)]
*  the question is what Iran is capable of now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=88.2s)]
*  Israel already has air superiority over Iran after just a few days of war. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=92.16s)]
*  And while most attention is focused on nuclear targets, just yesterday Israel said it had [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=96.96s)]
*  hit 12 missile launch and storage sites. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=102.0s)]
*  Back in 2020, Iran targeted a US base here in Iraq with ballistic missiles. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=105.36s)]
*  But could they still do that? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  We don't know for sure. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=112.16s)]
*  Holly Williams, CBS News, our bill in Northern Iraq. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=113.92s)]
*  I want to turn now to my CBS colleague, Charlie Daggett, at the Pentagon. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  Charlie, what's the latest there? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=124.24s)]
*  Well, you know, you could say that the Pentagon is preparing for war, right? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=127.16s)]
*  That sounds like a dramatic statement. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  But when is the Pentagon not preparing for war, Major? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=134.76s)]
*  You know, the atmosphere here can be described as a little bit jittery last night. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=138.44s)]
*  Quite that feeling today. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=142.06s)]
*  But we're told by several sources, defense sources, that they are bracing for any kind [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=144.3s)]
*  of Iranian retaliation. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=149.74s)]
*  As Holly just said, 40,000 troops throughout that area, the Middle East, not just the ones [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=151.86s)]
*  possibly the most vulnerable at that base in Iraq, 2,500 service members there. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=158.3s)]
*  But you've got the Fifth Fleet in Bahrain, you've got Kuwait, you've got the UAE. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=163.5s)]
*  There are several potential targets for Iran to aim at. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=168.34s)]
*  And we have learned from intelligence service members that the Iranians, as they said, are [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=173.0s)]
*  aiming some of those missiles and other weapons toward U.S. bases and interests in the region. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=179.68s)]
*  So again, Pentagon's a planning organization. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=186.26s)]
*  They're planning for what may come. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=188.86s)]
*  They're also flooding the entire area with a massive amount of military equipment. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=190.1s)]
*  There's a carrier strike group that's been there for a while. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=195.62s)]
*  The Carl Vincente, there are several destroyers with it, some in the Red Sea, a few more at [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=198.26s)]
*  the coast of the Mediterranean, so also in that region. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=204.73999999999998s)]
*  And there's also another carrier headed there, the USS Nimitz, that is being redirected there [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=207.82s)]
*  from the Indo-Opacom region. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=212.62s)]
*  And there's also going to be the USS Henry Ford headed to the Europe Theater of Command. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  So a lot of stuff headed in that direction. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=221.42s)]
*  The new squadron of F-16s, F-35s, F-22s that are sent there. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=223.66s)]
*  Refueling tankers, that's really important because that not only enables some long-range [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=228.01999999999998s)]
*  bombers to increase their range, should there be a U.S. attack in Iran, but it also gives [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=233.34s)]
*  fighter jets the opportunity to loiter. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  Because what Secretary Hegseth has referred to time and again, this is about force protection. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  These are defensive measures, and you want to have planes that can loiter over areas, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=247.28s)]
*  particularly parts of Iraq, anywhere near that border with Iran, the Red Sea, anywhere [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=251.94s)]
*  where there are U.S. military assets, you want to have fighters in the air to protect them. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=257.18s)]
*  And Charlie, it has been said more than once that there is particular U.S. air power and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=263.90000000000003s)]
*  armaments necessary if the president so decides to substantially degrade underground nuclear [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=269.22s)]
*  facilities in Iran. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=279.22s)]
*  And the likely place that those B-2 bombers would leave from is Diego Garcia. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=281.22s)]
*  I have read, is that part of the matrix we should be keeping an eye on? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=286.42s)]
*  Well, we know that the B-2s were with Diego Garcia. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=293.42s)]
*  We can't confirm that they're still there. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=295.42s)]
*  We do know that B-52s are there. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=296.94s)]
*  Both of those aircraft can carry what you're referring to, the 30,000-pound massive ordnance [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=299.3s)]
*  penetrator. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=304.78000000000003s)]
*  It is a big, heavy bomb, and only a couple of aircraft are able to carry it and deliver [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=305.78000000000003s)]
*  it to its target. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=312.18s)]
*  And yes, that would be the knockout blow. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=314.78000000000003s)]
*  The Israelis have their own form of bunker busters, but nothing with the kind of penetrating [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=316.78000000000003s)]
*  power of that particular weapon. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  So if the United States were to engage and try to take out Iran's nuclear facilities [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=326.06s)]
*  with a sort of knockout blow, it's very likely that that kind of weapon would be used, because [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=333.38s)]
*  the Iranians, especially when it comes to their nuclear facilities, are deep underground, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=340.02000000000004s)]
*  literally in a sort of mountain, underneath a mountain. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=344.14s)]
*  It's got cement and steel reinforced, and there aren't too many weapons that can get [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=347.82s)]
*  down there. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=353.18s)]
*  Certainly, the Israelis don't have it in their arsenal or the delivery to do that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=354.18s)]
*  And I also have to mention here, the Israelis have talked about owning the airspace, and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=359.09999999999997s)]
*  I know President Trump said that we own the airspace. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=362.82s)]
*  They have all but knocked out most of the air defenses, as we understand it, in Iran, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=366.34s)]
*  which enables Israel's fighter jets to fly over with impunity and take out targets, including [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=371.38s)]
*  Iranian leadership. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=377.1s)]
*  So it may be that one of the options that President Trump might be considering is he [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=379.26s)]
*  doesn't want to imperil U.S. fighters, fighter jets, or bombers, or personnel. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=385.34000000000003s)]
*  But if he feels that that area has been cleared of any serious or significant air defenses, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=391.54s)]
*  he may be more confident to deploy American fighter jets and bombers over Iran. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDrgneBpsE&t=397.32s)]
