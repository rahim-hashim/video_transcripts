# Trump will make decision on bombing Iran sites within next two weeks, White House says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI)
*  I have a message directly from the president, and I quote, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=0.0s)]
*  based on the fact that there's a substantial chance [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=3.7s)]
*  of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=6.24s)]
*  in the near future, I will make my decision [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  whether or not to go within the next two weeks. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=12.4s)]
*  That's a quote directly from the president [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=15.74s)]
*  for all of you today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=17.54s)]
*  So we'll kick it off for questions [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=19.04s)]
*  here in our new media seat. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=20.34s)]
*  All right, so that's a ticking clock. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=22.64s)]
*  Within the next two weeks, 14 days. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  So as we awake to see what happens in any discussions, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=28.9s)]
*  be it with Iran and other leaders of other nations [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=32.04s)]
*  or directly with President Donald Trump [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=34.9s)]
*  as he continues to demand complete surrender [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=37.9s)]
*  by Iran's leadership, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=40.599999999999994s)]
*  we do have to look at the what-ifs here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=42.3s)]
*  You look at Iran, you look at Israel, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=44.54s)]
*  and you look at their capability militarily. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=46.34s)]
*  Do they have the capability to continue the war [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=50.2s)]
*  without the support of the United States? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=52.7s)]
*  Great question. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=55.739999999999995s)]
*  So on the part of the Iranians, two things we do know, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=56.58s)]
*  they've never fought a war like this before. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=59.68s)]
*  They've never been under such intense attack before, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  not just by the United States, I'm sorry, by Israel, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=64.22s)]
*  but Israel backed by essentially the United States. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=66.53999999999999s)]
*  So that's very important. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=69.94s)]
*  The Iranians don't know what might be around the corner [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  and whether they can sort of stay the course [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=74.88s)]
*  for two more weeks. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=76.88s)]
*  And by the way, do we know how many missiles they got left [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=77.72s)]
*  or drones for that matter? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=80.24s)]
*  Great unknowns there. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=81.72s)]
*  In terms of Israel, the same. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=82.82s)]
*  They fought lots of wars since the State of Israel [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=84.38s)]
*  was created in 1948. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=87.08s)]
*  They have never engaged an adversary this size before. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  There are reports from Israel. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=91.88s)]
*  Maybe they're gonna run low on interceptors [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=93.24s)]
*  when it comes to stopping those missiles. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=95.97999999999999s)]
*  Are they gonna stay the course for two weeks? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=98.42s)]
*  Candidate, these are the big questions we have to ask. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=100.14s)]
*  And the final point I make, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  remember, if you're sitting in Tehran, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=106.02s)]
*  you have to question everything President Trump says [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=108.08s)]
*  at this point, because he was for diplomacy [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=110.62s)]
*  before he had quietly given Israel the green light [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=113.08s)]
*  to attack Iran. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=115.24s)]
*  So I do wonder if you're sitting in Tehran, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=116.34s)]
*  if you're gonna believe that for two weeks, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=119.38s)]
*  maybe the window for diplomacy is open. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=121.52s)]
*  Is it really? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=123.82s)]
*  And it is. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=124.84s)]
*  I think the Iranians will jump at it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  Alex, thank you so much, senior fellow [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=127.74s)]
*  at the Middle East Institute. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=129.64s)]
*  We appreciate your experience and your expertise. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=131.02s)]
*  We hope to talk to you again here on CBS News 24 seven. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0XiFjiTQI&t=133.44s)]
