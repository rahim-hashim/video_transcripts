# "All the parties at the table have failed" to free those held by Hamas, mother of hostage says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY)
*  Parties are gathering in Cairo today to restart negotiations to release the more than 130 hostages being held by Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=0.0s)]
*  Rachel Goldberg-Poland's 23-year-old son, Hirsch, is one of those taken by Hamas six months ago, and she joins us from New York. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=8.88s)]
*  Welcome to Face the Nation. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=20.52s)]
*  And I cannot imagine how painful the last six months have been for you, the 184 days that your son has been away from you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=22.72s)]
*  But I know you've been on a mission. You met with the Pope. You've been to the UN. You have been to the White House. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=33.8s)]
*  And tomorrow you will be back at the White House. What are you expecting to hear? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=38.64s)]
*  Well, you know, this is such a painful, staggeringly indescribable odyssey that we are on. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=47.4s)]
*  And as you said, you can't imagine. I often say, oh, I also can't imagine what we're going through. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=57.84s)]
*  And, yes, we are going to be returning to Washington tomorrow to have meetings with different people in the administration. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=65.16s)]
*  And we really want to understand what is happening to ensure that these people and remember, Margaret, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=74.08s)]
*  we have eight American citizens who have been held for 184 days and we are feeling extreme desperation, despair. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=80.84s)]
*  And we've had wonderful access and sympathy and open doors and lots of hugs from everyone in the U.S. government. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=95.44s)]
*  But this is a very binary situation. We want our people back, period. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=107.92s)]
*  And that's what we're going to be talking tomorrow about is what is actually going to be happening, what leverage, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  what levers need to be pulled in order to make this happen, because six months is actually a complete failure on everybody's part. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=123.0s)]
*  And I actually include myself in that as a parent, that I have not been able to save my son. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=132.72s)]
*  And I don't know. I think that you're a parent. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=138.92s)]
*  Anyone who is a parent can can appreciate our job is to keep our children safe. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=141.76s)]
*  And when they get in a situation when they're not safe, our job is to save them. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  And I feel that I have failed and I feel that our governments have failed and I feel that all the parties at the table have failed to get these 133 souls back home. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  You have said in the past you wish the mothers could be at the negotiating table. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  I also read you said Israeli leaders are not thinking straight because they're speaking from a place of guilt ridden trauma. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  And you've asked the Jewish communities around the world to press the men in power. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  What are you asking people at home to do to help you? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=184.64s)]
*  Well, there are so many different things that can be done. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=191.72s)]
*  You know, there's there's advocacy really that needs to be done so that people around the world understand who is this cohort of hostages that are being held. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  I think there's so much noise and anger and hatred. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  In the world, that people are forgetting that there are so there's a a representation of all different types of people being held. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=210.32s)]
*  You know, we still have eight Muslim Arabs being held in this hostage cohort. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=221.0s)]
*  We have seven Thai Buddhists being held. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  We have two black African Christians being held. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=231.08s)]
*  We have people from Nepal and people from Mexico and people from Germany and people from France, people from all over the world. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  This is not just one homogenous group of people that is being held. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  And I think that that kind of gets lost in all the noise. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=248.16s)]
*  I think talking to your leaders wherever you are in the world, certainly your local elected leaders in America, writing to the White House again, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=254.56s)]
*  the Biden administration has been wonderful and very supportive, but we have one goal. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=264.8s)]
*  We need these people home. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=271.88s)]
*  Yes, we wish you our best and we are watching your advocacy and we'll continue asking questions about your son and the others. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOp75NiHjIY&t=273.6s)]
