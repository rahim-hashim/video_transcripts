# Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on "Face the Nation," Feb. 25, 2024 | full interview
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [February 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU)
*  We turn now to the crisis in the Middle East and the war between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining us from Tel Aviv is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=5.68s)]
*  Welcome back to Face the Nation, sir. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=10.32s)]
*  Thank you. Good to be with you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=12.16s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, the U.S. is working on a hostage deal that President Biden has said [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=14.4s)]
*  would bring with it at least six weeks of calm. The intelligence chiefs met on Friday. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=19.28s)]
*  Are we close to a deal? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=25.36s)]
*  Well, I'm not sure the exact duration, but I can tell you that we're all working on it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=27.36s)]
*  We want it. I want it. Because we want to liberate the remaining hostages. We've already [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=31.52s)]
*  brought half of them back. And I appreciate the effort, the combined effort of Israel, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=36.64s)]
*  the United States, to bring back the remaining hostages. I can't tell you if we'll have it, but [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=41.12s)]
*  if Hamas goes down from its delusional claims and goes down, can bring them down to earth, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  then we'll have the progress that we all want. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=52.56s)]
*  What specifically is holding up the deal at this point? Reportedly, this would have 30 to 40 [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=54.8s)]
*  hostages, women, elderly, wounded released in exchange for a few hundred Palestinian [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  prisoners being released. I don't think it makes any sense to have a public discussion of this, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=66.56s)]
*  but Hamas started out with just crazy demands. And, you know, it's too soon to say if they've [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=72.4s)]
*  abandoned them, but if they do abandon them and get into what you call the ballpark, they're not [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=80.32s)]
*  even in the city. They're in another planet. But if they come down to a reasonable situation, then, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  yes, we'll have a hostage. I hope so. There are at least six U.S. citizens among those being held by [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  Hamas. For you, is the return of living hostages necessary and essential for you to declare victory [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=100.72s)]
*  in this war? Yes, we said I've set three war goals. The first is to release the hostages. The second [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=109.84s)]
*  is to destroy Hamas. And the third is to ensure that Gaza does not pose a threat to Israel [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=117.44s)]
*  in the future. And obviously, the three are intertwined. They they're achieved basically [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  by our very effective and often heroic military operation and also by tough negotiations. We're [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=129.04s)]
*  combining the two, and I hope it yields the result. But understand that unless we have total victory, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=136.0s)]
*  we can't have peace. We can't leave Hamas in place. We can't leave a quarter of Hamas [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=142.32s)]
*  battalions in Ra'afah and say, well, that's fine. They'll be there. It's like saying a quarter of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=147.2s)]
*  ISIS will be left with a defined territory because, you know, they'll reconstitute themselves [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=153.36s)]
*  immediately. So total victory is important to achieve the war goal of destroying Hamas, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=158.56s)]
*  of releasing the hostages and ensuring that Gaza doesn't pose a threat. But I think it also is [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=163.76s)]
*  essential for any future peaceful Middle East. Sure. And the defeat for the Iran terror axis. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  On the issue of the hostages, as you know, time is of the essence here. So if this deal happens [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=174.72s)]
*  and there are six weeks of calm that go with it, does that provide an opening to end this war? Or [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=179.92s)]
*  will you still go into southern Gaza in Ra'afah regardless? Yeah, well, victory is within reach, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=186.56s)]
*  and you can't have victory until you eliminate Hamas. Hamas is a terrorist organization that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=193.44s)]
*  once we begin the Ra'afah operation, the intense phase of the fighting [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=200.72s)]
*  is weeks away from completion, not months, weeks away from completion. And that is we've already [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=205.04s)]
*  destroyed 18 out of the 24 Hamas terrorist battalions. So we have a few and four of them [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=211.12s)]
*  are concentrated in Ra'afah. We can't leave the last Hamas stronghold [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=218.24s)]
*  without taking care of it. Obviously, we have to do it. But understand, too, that I've asked the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  army to submit to me a double plan. First, to evacuate, to enable the evacuation of the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=228.72s)]
*  Palestinian civilians in Gaza. And obviously, second, to destroy the remaining Hamas battalions. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=235.44s)]
*  That gets us a real, real distance towards the completion of our victory. And that, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  we're not going to give it up. If we have a deal, it'll be delayed somewhat, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=249.04s)]
*  but it'll happen. If we don't have a deal, we'll do it anyway. It has to be done because total [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=252.88s)]
*  victory is our goal. And total victory is within reach, not months away, weeks away once we begin [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=258.24s)]
*  the operation. Well, the White House says they need to see a credible and executable plan to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=263.92s)]
*  protect civilians and the 1.4 million people who are sheltering in southern Gaza. This morning, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=268.8s)]
*  the White House says they still have not seen such a plan and no major military operation [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=274.72s)]
*  should proceed without it. Have you approved the plans that you said you've asked for? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=279.92s)]
*  Actually, Margaret, I'm going from here to a meeting with the general staff where they're [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  going to show me this dual plan, a plan to evacuate and a plan to dismantle those remaining [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=291.68s)]
*  battalions. So yes, by the way, we agree on this. I mean, we don't have to be prodded. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=299.2s)]
*  We're on the same page with the U.S. on this because that's how we do it. The reason you have [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=304.08s)]
*  that population in Ra'afah is because we actually cleared them away from the other places, the zones, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=309.68s)]
*  combat zones that we had. That's why they're there. So now there's room for them to go [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=316.24s)]
*  north of Ra'afah to the places that we've already finished fighting in. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=320.8s)]
*  That's where you're going to move. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=324.8s)]
*  And that's basically what we're going to do. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=325.68s)]
*  That's the plan, to move 1.4 million people into northern Gaza. Can you guarantee that the IDF will [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=326.72s)]
*  not push? I didn't say northern Gaza. I said north of Ra'afah. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=333.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=338.16s)]
*  I said north of Ra'afah. In the northern part of the Gaza Strip, we still have fighting going on. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=338.64s)]
*  That is important. It's important to understand moving civilians out of an area that is going to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  be a combat zone is not a bad thing. It's a good thing. And that's what Israel is going to do. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=350.32s)]
*  Understood. But the IDF, can you guarantee that they won't push Palestinians out of Gaza and into [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=355.92s)]
*  Egypt? As you know, Egyptian officials have said if you do that, you are putting at risk 46 years [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=361.84s)]
*  of peace. Look, I think that the Egyptians know very well that that's not our purpose [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=367.92s)]
*  and that won't be the result. And we're coordinating. We're talking to the Egyptians [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=373.76s)]
*  all the time. So that's not, I don't think that's an issue. The peace between Israel and Egypt to [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=378.24s)]
*  serve the interest of both countries and will continue to serve the interest of both countries, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=383.28s)]
*  I don't think it's in any danger. You said that victory is within reach. But US Intel says the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=387.76s)]
*  IDF has only destroyed 30% of Hamas leadership and that the amount of tunnels that Hamas uses [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=395.76s)]
*  have really only been tiny in terms of what has been destroyed by the IDF. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=404.32s)]
*  There is growing distrust of you personally, sir, you know this, in the US Congress and within the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=409.76s)]
*  Biden White House. When your closest ally is telling you things like this and telling you [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  that you need to reconsider a strategy, isn't it worth considering? Look, I think that the US [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=423.04s)]
*  agrees with us on the goal of destroying Hamas and on the goal of releasing the hostages. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=430.64s)]
*  The decisions of how to do that are left with us and with me and the elected cabinet of Israel. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  And we're doing that. A lot of things that we were told by the best of friends initially turned out [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=442.8s)]
*  not to be true. They said you can't enter the ground war without having enormous complications. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=449.2s)]
*  They said you cannot fight, you can't enter Gaza City, you can't go into the tunnels. It'll be [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  a terrible bloodbath. All of that turned out to be not true. Our soldiers are in the tunnel network. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=460.64s)]
*  We don't have to take apart hundreds of kilometers of tunnels. We are taking apart [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=466.0s)]
*  the missile production factories that are underground, the command and control headquarters, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=470.47999999999996s)]
*  the computers that are there, the money that is there, the weapons that are there, and the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=475.36s)]
*  ammos that is there. We're doing that methodically. So we're doing the war. You can't substitute for [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=479.12s)]
*  the Israeli military command. And we're doing it very responsibly. John Spencer, who's the head [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=486.48s)]
*  of urban warfare at West Point, says that no other army has gone to the lengths that Israel's army [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=492.32s)]
*  has gone to clear civilians out of harm's way, even though Hamas is doing everything to keep them [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=497.44s)]
*  in harm's way. We respect our American people. Oh, sure. But the former head of Central Command [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=502.40000000000003s)]
*  was on this program just a few weeks ago and said basically you have not articulated any specific [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=504.72s)]
*  end game here. So, but putting that aside, I want to come back to a few different things you said. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=509.6s)]
*  Margaret, hold on. You lob these grenades at me and you keep on moving. Well, first of all, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=514.32s)]
*  you say there's no confidence in me. Well, the Israeli public has confidence in me. Last week, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=520.24s)]
*  there were massive protests throughout Israel yesterday. Of course, we have protests. We have [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=525.76s)]
*  protests. Israel is a democracy. We've had protests for 30 years. But the Israeli people [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=531.44s)]
*  are united as never before. Last week, they voted 99 to 9 in the Knesset for my proposal that says [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=535.9200000000001s)]
*  the way that we have to do two things. We have to win the war, have total victory, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=544.16s)]
*  but also not have an international dictate of a Palestinian state on it, shoved down our throats [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=548.08s)]
*  that would endanger Israel. The people are overwhelmingly united on this. When is the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=553.6800000000001s)]
*  last time we had 99 votes in the Knesset? I'll tell you, 30 years ago. So the people are united. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=558.16s)]
*  The policy is right. The people support it. And I intend to take it to completion because that's [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=564.64s)]
*  what we have. We can't compromise with total victory because I'll tell you, we can't win the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=570.0s)]
*  peace if we don't win the war and we will win this war. One of the members of the Knesset, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=575.04s)]
*  the former Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid said he asked the Americans about what you just said [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=579.68s)]
*  about a unilateral declaration of recognition of Palestinian state. And he said, you invented a [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=584.96s)]
*  threat that doesn't exist. There was not one official in the world that suggested unilateral [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=590.16s)]
*  recognition of the Palestinians. So putting that aside, I want to- Well, actually, the foreign [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=594.96s)]
*  secretary of Britain just spoke about it. There have been many- Well, this is the US. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=600.0s)]
*  I hope that's true. We've heard a lot of briefings coming from the US to that effect. So I hope it's [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=605.76s)]
*  true. And if it's true, then that will reinforce the decision made by the government, by the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=613.52s)]
*  people of Israel through their elected representatives. And by the way, if people [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=621.28s)]
*  And by the way, if people try to foist it on us, it would be a terrible mistake [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=626.0s)]
*  because it would be seen as a reward for terror after the most atrocious attack [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=630.16s)]
*  committed against the Jewish people since the Holocaust. So people of Israel are not going to [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=635.1999999999999s)]
*  buy it. And if you want peace, you shouldn't go that route. Peace will be achieved through [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=639.28s)]
*  direct negotiations between the parties down the line. I don't think the Palestinians are [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=643.92s)]
*  ready for it, but when they are, that's the way it'll be achieved, not by international fiat. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=647.84s)]
*  I want to come back to something you said where you were raising questions about US intelligence [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=652.32s)]
*  and advice to you from the Biden administration, where you said it was wrong. You also said there [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=657.2s)]
*  was no bloodbath. I didn't say it was wrong. I said some good friends gave us advice that turned [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=662.4000000000001s)]
*  out to be that we performed a lot better than they anticipated. And by the way, we performed a lot [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=669.12s)]
*  better than we anticipated. Well, on the no bloodbath, Doctors Without Borders went to the UN this week [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=675.12s)]
*  and said the civilian toll in Gaza is so high. They came up with a new term, wounded child, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=682.16s)]
*  no surviving family. Save the Children says there are over a thousand children who have lost a limb [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=688.64s)]
*  over these past days since the beginning of the October 7th war. What Hamas has done is horrific, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=694.7199999999999s)]
*  but President Biden has said your actions, sir, are over the top. Aren't you concerned that Israel [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=702.4s)]
*  is creating more terrorists than it is killing? I think that any civilian casualty is a tragedy, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=711.12s)]
*  and I don't say that halfheartedly. I lost a brother in war. I myself was wounded [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=717.84s)]
*  while releasing hostages from a hijacked plane. I've lost friends in battle. I know what it means [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=725.12s)]
*  to lose friends and what it means to lose family members. So we don't have an argument there. But [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=733.36s)]
*  this war has been forced upon us by a cynical enemy that not only targets our civilians, has [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=738.64s)]
*  raped, beheaded, burnt babies alive, killed children in front of their parents and parents [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=744.4s)]
*  in front of their children. This enemy not only targets civilians, but hides behind [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=750.0s)]
*  civilians, Palestinian civilians. So they're committing a double war crime. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=757.36s)]
*  I have to come back and say that in terms of the way this battle is fought, there is no parallel [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=761.84s)]
*  to the difficulty that we face. And John Spencer, the head of urban warfare at West Point, says that [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=768.32s)]
*  no other army has faced such a task. It gives one comparison. Yeah, that's not the question I asked, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=773.7600000000001s)]
*  though. It gives most of us a comparison. Well, it is, but that's the answer. You can't say, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=778.48s)]
*  oh, you give immunity to the terrorists because they're hiding among civilians and forcing [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=783.36s)]
*  civilians not to leave. So what do you do? You say, OK, we'll give you immunity. Hamas [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=789.12s)]
*  survives. We'll live to fight another, to commit another massacre and another massacre. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  What would America do? What would America do, Margaret, if you face the equivalent of 2911s, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=800.48s)]
*  50,000 Americans slaughtered in one day, 10,000 Americans, including mothers and children, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=807.4399999999999s)]
*  held hostage? Would you not be doing what Israel is doing? You'd be doing a hell of a lot more. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=812.56s)]
*  And all Americans that I talk to nearly all say that. So Israel has gone to extraordinary lengths, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=817.12s)]
*  calling up people, civilians, Palestinians in Gaza, telling them, leave your home, sending [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=822.24s)]
*  pamphlets. We have done that effort. Hamas tries to keep them at one point. We'll clear them out of [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=828.0s)]
*  harm's way. We'll complete the job and achieve total victory, which is necessary to give a [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=833.52s)]
*  secure future for Israel, a better future for Gaza, a better future for the Middle East and a setback [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=838.8s)]
*  for the Iran terror axis. That's in all our interests. It's in America's interest, too. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=844.4s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, I'm told we are out of time. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=848.8s)]
*  Face the Nation will be back in one minute. We hope you'll stay with us. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01L_Gj9_vU&t=851.12s)]
