# 4-year-old American on list of hostages set to be released today, Qatari PM says
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A)
*  We're joined now by the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=0.0s)]
*  bin Abdur Rahman al-Thani. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=4.64s)]
*  It is his first interview since Qatar helped broker this hostage deal between Hamas and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=11.76s)]
*  Qatar has also facilitated getting Americans stuck in Gaza out of the region. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=12.76s)]
*  Good morning to you, sir. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, thank you very much for having me, Margaret. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Sheikh, the White House told us that at least one American is expected to be released by [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Hamas today. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=30.84s)]
*  You've seen the list of hostages. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=33.04s)]
*  Will we see four-year-old Abigael Idan released today? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=35.56s)]
*  And are you confident this exchange will happen? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=40.04s)]
*  Well, so far things are moving in the right direction. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  We've been working very closely with the U.S. government, with the White House, of course. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  We are hoping that we will see the release happening shortly. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=53.36s)]
*  And within the list, they include Abigael, the young girl, four years old. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=57.28s)]
*  Will we see more Americans released soon? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=64.92s)]
*  Well, we are hopeful, actually. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=67.72s)]
*  There are still some names which are supposed to be on the first group. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=70.84s)]
*  Until now, we didn't get the confirmation yet. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=76.36s)]
*  But we are working on a daily basis and making sure that every day we have the list of the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=79.08000000000001s)]
*  next day. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  So we are hopeful to have a confirmation of proof of life for them and hopefully the release [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  at the end of the agreement. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  As I mentioned, things are happening on a daily basis. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  And we are focused on today's operation and hopefully that will happen very shortly from now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=103.64s)]
*  Well, Mr. Prime Minister, I understand a Qatari delegation visited Israel yesterday and Gaza today. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=110.24s)]
*  Do you expect that this four-day truce will be extended? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=118.04s)]
*  And if so, for how long? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=123.2s)]
*  Well, actually, we are hopeful. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=125.36s)]
*  According to the agreement that has been agreed upon in the last few days for this four-day [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=128.64s)]
*  pause, the agreement has a provision that if Hamas will be able to locate and secure [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=136.84s)]
*  some of the hostages that are within the criteria of the first group, which is women and children, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  then it will be extended, depends on the number that they will have. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=152.04s)]
*  If this is something we cannot confirm yet until we get to the fourth day, then Hamas [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=157.8s)]
*  should present the list if they are available with them. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=164.32000000000002s)]
*  Our delegation who have reached to Israel and to Gaza, they are totally two separate [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=168.76000000000002s)]
*  delegations. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=176.4s)]
*  The Gaza delegation is focused on ensuring that humanitarian aid are sufficient, that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=177.4s)]
*  they are going, the humanitarian aid that's going in Gaza and it's a pure humanitarian mission. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=183.88s)]
*  Do you know where Yahya Senwar, the Hamas commander believed to have planned these attacks, is right now? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=189.32s)]
*  Well, I don't think that this information is available with anyone except, you know, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=197.72s)]
*  the people who are close to him. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=204.16s)]
*  And this is an information really that doesn't relate much to what we are doing right now [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=206.12s)]
*  and on the ongoing negotiations. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=212.28s)]
*  Our communication throughout the years that we had with Hamas has been very exclusive [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=215.72s)]
*  to the political wing and the political representatives in the office here in Doha and that's it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=222.72s)]
*  And we don't deal directly with or never have any dealing with the military wing. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=230.08s)]
*  Well, Qatar is home to the very large U.S. military base. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=236.44s)]
*  Qatar is a major non-NATO U.S. ally, but in this country, a number of Republican lawmakers [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=241.96s)]
*  in particular have publicly called for your country to hand over those Hamas political [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=249.24s)]
*  leaders. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=255.26000000000002s)]
*  What is the future? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=257.24s)]
*  Will they remain in Qatar? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=258.64s)]
*  Margaret, our relation with the U.S. is a very solid relationship and alliance that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  throughout the decades we've been working together very closely in ensuring peace and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=269.72s)]
*  stability in the region. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=275.44000000000005s)]
*  And in several occasions, Qatar has been always stepping up to this partnership and if you [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=277.68s)]
*  recall Afghanistan and currently right now we've been working very closely with the White [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=284.24s)]
*  House, with the CIA and State Department to ensure that this deal is happening. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  The President of the United States is in constant contact with his [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=294.4s)]
*  Honorable Amir and I've been in constant communication with our colleagues in the White House, CIA [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=294.65999999999997s)]
*  and State Department as well. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=303.65999999999997s)]
*  There is a relation that's based on trust, based on mutual interest of both countries. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=306.79999999999995s)]
*  This office, when it's established, it's established in coordination with the U.S. to establish [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  the communication with Hamas and it's been always useful not only for the U.S. but for [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=318.17999999999995s)]
*  Israel and for the stability of the region. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=324.32s)]
*  And as long as this is something useful and also, you know, right now we are in the middle [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  of the negotiation, we will always keep the communication open with everyone. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  Do you see an opportunity in this short truce to have some kind of diplomatic agreement [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=341.23999999999995s)]
*  to end the conflict? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=349.05999999999995s)]
*  And will Qatar play a role in the future of Gaza? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=351.26s)]
*  Well, our relationship, Margaret, is with the Palestinian people, with the Palestinian [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=355.7s)]
*  cause. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=360.74s)]
*  Our support for the Palestinian people has been ongoing for decades and this is what [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=361.74s)]
*  Qatar stood for. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=365.74s)]
*  Whoever is governing the Palestinians, it's their choice and I believe that our focus [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=366.9s)]
*  right now is how to end this war, how to ensure that this is not repeated and the only way [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=373.36s)]
*  to ensure that this is not repeated is to resolve it peacefully, to have a political [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=380.02s)]
*  solution and provide the Palestinian people with a political horizon for a state. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=385.48s)]
*  And then the day after and who will govern Gaza, Gaza and the West Bank should be one [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=390.38s)]
*  unit, one country under one leadership that will be chosen by the Palestinian people. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=395.4s)]
*  Prime Minister, I appreciate your time in the middle of this intense diplomacy. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=400.66s)]
*  We will be watching and hoping for progress. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=405.9s)]
*  Thank you very much, Margaret, for having me. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA889Za3O3A&t=409.2s)]
