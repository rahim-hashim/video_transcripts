# Far-right Israeli group seeks to "resettle Gaza"
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk)
*  Following Hamas's October 7th attack on Israel, a far-right Israeli settler movement began [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=0.0s)]
*  advancing efforts to drive Palestinians out of Gaza, even if it violates international [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=6.08s)]
*  law. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=10.6s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Rami Anos-Sensio spoke with members of that movement, and we [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=11.6s)]
*  want to warn you, some of the images in his report may be disturbing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=15.0s)]
*  As musicians and organizers warmed up, Israeli families who traveled from across the country [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=20.42s)]
*  lazed and laughed in the desert sun, with fairground candy and a marionette show, as [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=26.08s)]
*  seemingly innocuous banners signaled a controversial cause. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=32.48s)]
*  We're just a couple miles away from the Gaza Strip, which is west of us that way. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=36.72s)]
*  This right here behind me is a gathering of far-right Israeli groups that have the mission [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=40.9s)]
*  of resettling Gaza, and they believe that that possibility is getting closer every day [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=46.62s)]
*  after the events of October 7th. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=52.0s)]
*  That is illegal under international law. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=55.96s)]
*  But the mission of this far-right fringe is gaining traction, after Hamas killed about [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=58.84s)]
*  1,200 Israelis in the worst terror attack on Israeli soil. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=66.76s)]
*  The Gaza population lost its right to be in Gaza on the 7th of October. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=71.16s)]
*  Daniela Weiss is beloved by her followers as the strident godmother of Israel's settler [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=80.0s)]
*  movement. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=85.84s)]
*  This zealous crowd doesn't need convincing, like Ranit Bonomo, a grandmother to 40. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  Help me understand the foundation of the belief. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=93.64s)]
*  The most basic reason is that it's God-given. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  International law, modern-day international law. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=101.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=103.4s)]
*  Contravenes that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=104.4s)]
*  If it belongs to us, it's not illegal. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=105.4s)]
*  This deep religious conviction drives unity. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=110.56s)]
*  Many here traveled with their family from the occupied West Bank, like Aharon Gottlieb. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=113.06s)]
*  Would you be one of the first to go into Gaza to settle? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=118.17999999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=121.06s)]
*  I'm waiting. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=122.06s)]
*  You're waiting? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=123.06s)]
*  I'm waiting. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=124.06s)]
*  Born in New York, he and his family moved to Israel when he was nine and became settlers. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=125.06s)]
*  Do you personally want all Palestinians to be forced from Gaza? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=128.82s)]
*  Again, I have nothing against a person who's innocent. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=133.66s)]
*  I just don't believe there are innocent people there. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=137.62s)]
*  That would amount to ethnic cleansing in a war that's already killed over 40,000 Palestinians, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=141.06s)]
*  according to the Hamas-run Palestinian Health Ministry. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=147.22s)]
*  Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been internally displaced. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=150.73999999999998s)]
*  Survivors could be internationally displaced if the settler movement succeeds. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=155.1s)]
*  Where would they go? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=160.34s)]
*  I think there are many, many European countries who would be happy to accept them. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=161.34s)]
*  The world is very, very large. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=165.7s)]
*  They can fit them in. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=166.7s)]
*  There's not that many of them. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=168.17999999999998s)]
*  Settlement of Gaza would likely follow the West Bank playbook, often young, fervent Israelis [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=170.57999999999998s)]
*  harassing and killing Palestinians for their land. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=175.64s)]
*  Since the 1990s, the number of West Bank settlers has nearly tripled to about 700,000, says [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=178.98s)]
*  the UN. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  Last year, this group of young, militarized settlers was willing to speak with us in a [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=185.98s)]
*  rare interaction as we stood overlooking the Jordan Valley. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=190.17999999999998s)]
*  They were unashamed to say what Palestinians should do. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=195.22s)]
*  There is a solution if they leave. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=198.62s)]
*  It makes our life very easy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=201.34s)]
*  Encourage Gazans to leave Gaza. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=205.82s)]
*  The message from Israel's national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gavir, at this week's [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=208.1s)]
*  rally. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=212.3s)]
*  Settlers have been emboldened from within the far-right government itself to try to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=213.3s)]
*  turn back time. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=217.7s)]
*  Before 2005, the year Israel's military pulled out of Gaza, pulling with them thousands of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=219.14s)]
*  settlers and dismantling their settlements. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=225.01999999999998s)]
*  Some are sentimental. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=227.74s)]
*  We used to spend the week there and it was just so, so, so beautiful. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=228.74s)]
*  And we used to pass all the little Arab villages along the way. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=233.54s)]
*  And it's a very, very good memory for me. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=237.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=240.98s)]
*  And I would like to go back there. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=241.98s)]
*  But outside the rally, anti-settlement and anti-government protesters condemned their [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=244.85999999999999s)]
*  ambitions. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=249.5s)]
*  This is horrible plan. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=250.5s)]
*  It's so un-moral. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=251.5s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=252.5s)]
*  And polls over the past year found a majority of Israelis do not support resettlement of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=253.5s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=259.98s)]
*  In January, one poll found 38 percent supported it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=260.98s)]
*  In April, a separate poll found only 19 percent support. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=263.98s)]
*  And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who relies on support from the far-right, has [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=268.58s)]
*  publicly rejected the idea of Jewish resettlement in Gaza, saying, no, I don't think that's [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=273.3s)]
*  a realistic goal. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=280.3s)]
*  Settlers are unswayed. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=282.38s)]
*  The Jews have always been and for better or for worse, will always be here. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=283.38s)]
*  Do you think you will see this in your lifetime? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=289.26s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=291.18s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=292.18s)]
*  I believe in what I'm doing and I believe that I'm part of history. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=293.18s)]
*  A history that a small but growing number of Israelis pray for, but the vast majority [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=298.82s)]
*  pray to never be revisited again. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PnitYYC6bk&t=304.29999999999995s)]
