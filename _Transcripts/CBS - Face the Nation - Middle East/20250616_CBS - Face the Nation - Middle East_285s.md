# Conflict between Israel, Iran enters uncharted territory as two rivals warn more could come
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q)
*  And we turn now with what began Thursday as an Israeli attack on Iran in order to debilitate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=6.32s)]
*  And the back and forth between the two countries continues to intensify, threatening an already [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=8.48s)]
*  unstable region. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=13.32s)]
*  Our Deborah Pada is in Tel Aviv with the latest. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=14.96s)]
*  The conflict between Israel and Iran is in uncharted territory. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=18.36s)]
*  As the escalating tensions enter their fourth day with the two rivals each warning there [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  is worse to come. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=27.76s)]
*  Overnight, wave after wave of Iranian drones bearing down on Tel Aviv. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  Most were intercepted. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=39.56s)]
*  Those that got through destroyed homes and shops. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=42.36s)]
*  Israel was quick to retaliate targeting an oil refinery and hitting buildings in Tehran. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  There have been casualties on both sides. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=54.72s)]
*  At least 12 Israelis were killed this weekend. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=58.24s)]
*  But that toll was dwarfed by the damage Israel inflicted on Iran. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=62.16s)]
*  With almost 100 civilian deaths, nearly 30 of them children and the assassination of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=67.72s)]
*  top military commanders and scientists. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=74.2s)]
*  The surprise Israeli strikes began on Thursday. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=77.72s)]
*  Israel wants to cripple Iran's nuclear capability already hitting four major facilities, Netanz, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=81.36s)]
*  Tabriz, Isfahan and Fordo, as well as key energy sites. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=87.6s)]
*  And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not done yet. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=92.4s)]
*  What they have felt so far, he said, is nothing compared to what's coming. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=98.8s)]
*  But Iran has warned of a far more ferocious response if Israel does not back down. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=107.36s)]
*  Another casualty, nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington scheduled for today. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=114.32s)]
*  Those have been postponed indefinitely. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=120.56s)]
*  Zohar Palti is the former director of Mossad Intelligence. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=123.44s)]
*  So are Israel and Iran at war? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=127.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=131.64s)]
*  Unequivocally? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=132.64s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=133.64s)]
*  But starting a war is one thing, ending it is a lot harder. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=135.2s)]
*  No doubt that without the Americans, without President Trump, nothing will be over here. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=140.16s)]
*  And when the American will decide enough is enough, whether with us, whether with the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=145.72s)]
*  Iranians or whether without, they have the ability to end it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  Not only is Netanyahu striking Iran, he is also appealing to the hearts and minds of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  hinting at regime change and urging them to stand up for their freedom. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=159.36s)]
*  That's our Deborah Pata in Tel Aviv. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=166.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=168.12s)]
*  And the conflict between Israel and Iran has undermined President Trump's efforts to negotiate [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=169.12s)]
*  directly with Iran on a nuclear deal. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=172.84s)]
*  Overnight, he vowed in a social media post that if the U.S. was attacked in any way by [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  Iran, that the, quote, full strength and might of U.S. armed forces would come down at levels [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  never seen before. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  And then seemingly offered to negotiate a deal between Iran and Israel. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=187.98s)]
*  We go now to Holly Williams, who is at Iran's border with Iraq. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=192.54s)]
*  Here in the Middle East, Iran has accused the U.S. of being complicit in Israel's attack [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=198.78s)]
*  and has threatened to target American military bases and ships if the U.S. blocks Iranian [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  strikes on Israel. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=210.33999999999997s)]
*  But the U.S. has already done that with air defense systems and a warship, according to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=212.06s)]
*  a U.S. military official. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=216.6s)]
*  There are around 40,000 American troops in the Middle East, a powerful presence that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=218.56s)]
*  aims to protect U.S. interests, including trade routes. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=223.74s)]
*  But if Iran did try to strike American forces, the roughly 2,500 U.S. troops here in Iraq [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=227.72s)]
*  could be the most obvious target since they're right next door. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=234.64s)]
*  Iran previously targeted U.S. forces in Iraq with ballistic missiles back in 2020 in retaliation [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=238.84s)]
*  for the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=245.46s)]
*  No U.S. service members were killed on that occasion. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=250.84s)]
*  Since then, a series of shifts has reshaped the Middle East and weakened Iran and its [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=254.46s)]
*  proxies. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=259.58s)]
*  The war in Gaza, Israel's decimation of the leadership of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the collapse [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=260.58s)]
*  of the Syrian regime, and now Israel's surprise attack. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=266.16s)]
*  If Iran does target American forces this time, it would be extremely risky because [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=270.26s)]
*  it will likely draw a sharp response from the U.S. when Iran is already under attack. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  That's Holly Williams reporting from the Iraq-Iran border. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk5xBP5id1Q&t=282.26s)]
