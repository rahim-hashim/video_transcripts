# U.S. military shows reporters floating pier off Gaza coast
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30)
*  All right, the U.S. military invited reporters to see its floating pier in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=0.0s)]
*  This was designed to be a base of operations to provide aid relief for Palestinians. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=5.3s)]
*  Our MTS Tayeb was granted access to the pier. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=10.34s)]
*  MTS, you are there. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=13.38s)]
*  How are the operations going? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=15.06s)]
*  Well, Vlad, the Army is saying it's going better, but let's be honest, it's not going [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=17.14s)]
*  very well at all. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=24.46s)]
*  This pier has been operational for well over six weeks. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=25.84s)]
*  The goal at the very beginning, at least, was to get over 150 trucks a day into Gaza, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=29.3s)]
*  which is just a fraction of what used to get in before October 7th. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=35.1s)]
*  But since this pier has been operational, it's only really been functioning for 16 days [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  in total. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=44.58s)]
*  And in that 16 days, we've seen around 400 or so trucks. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=45.66s)]
*  And again, when you think before October, 500 trucks used to get into Gaza every single [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=49.5s)]
*  day, it really isn't much. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=54.620000000000005s)]
*  When you consider the expense, this pier cost $230 million, took around a thousand [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=56.3s)]
*  U.S. servicemen to make. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=62.739999999999995s)]
*  And so the expense is enormous. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=64.53999999999999s)]
*  But just observationally, Vlad, we met a lot of servicemen there. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=67.5s)]
*  They're very committed to helping the people of Gaza. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=72.78s)]
*  But we haven't been able to get into Gaza since the start of the war. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=75.44s)]
*  We've of course been able to go in very infrequently with the Israeli military on embeds, but that's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=80.1s)]
*  it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=85.46s)]
*  And so to be able to stand even a few hundred feet away from Gaza, where we could see black [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=86.46s)]
*  smoke rising in the sky, where we could see building after building after building in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=92.14s)]
*  ruins, knowing that there's 2.3 million people in there who so desperately need help, many [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=99.02s)]
*  aid agencies saying, experiencing famine, this aid, this support, this pier is so desperately [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=105.02s)]
*  needed. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=111.06s)]
*  And critics of it say what really needs to happen is Israel to open up its land border [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=112.06s)]
*  and allow that aid in. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=117.66s)]
*  But all right, MTS on the ground reporting for us. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=118.66s)]
*  MTS, thank you very much. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=122.22s)]
*  Stay safe, my friend. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=123.22s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTQk3e4r30&t=124.22s)]
