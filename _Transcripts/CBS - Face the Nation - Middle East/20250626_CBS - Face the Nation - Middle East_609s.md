# Highlights from Hegseth's fiery news conference on U.S. strikes against Iran
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc)
*  A lot of focus though right now on the aftermath of the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran's supreme leader warned against any more attacks in his first public comments since [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=6.2s)]
*  a ceasefire was reached with Israel. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=11.0s)]
*  And Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is on the defensive today. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=13.44s)]
*  He held a news conference about the scale of the strikes and seemed frustrated about [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=16.64s)]
*  a leaked early assessment which estimated that Iran's nuclear program was set back by [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=21.32s)]
*  only a matter of months. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=26.46s)]
*  That is in direct conflict with the president's claim that three key Iranian nuclear facilities [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=28.12s)]
*  were obliterated. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=33.56s)]
*  Hegseth spent most of that news conference slamming the media for its reporting. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  He and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff stuck to the claim that the U.S. strikes [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=39.4s)]
*  on Iran destroyed their nuclear ambitions. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=44.16s)]
*  Here's part of what he had to say. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=46.92s)]
*  President Trump directed the most complex and secretive military operation in history [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=49.64s)]
*  and it was a resounding success resulting in a ceasefire agreement and the end of the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=55.72s)]
*  12 day war. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=61.28s)]
*  There's been a lot of discussion about what happened and what didn't happen. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  Step back for a second. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=66.28s)]
*  Because of decisive military action, President Trump created the conditions to end the war. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=68.0s)]
*  Decimating, choose your word, obliterating, destroying Iran's nuclear capabilities. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=74.36s)]
*  When you leak a portion of an intelligence assessment, but just a little portion, just [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=82.08s)]
*  a little portion that makes it seem like maybe the strike wasn't effective, then you start [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=86.44s)]
*  a news cycle. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=90.84s)]
*  Whether it's the Washington Post or Fox News or CNN or MSNBC, you start a news cycle that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=91.84s)]
*  starts to call into question. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=96.88s)]
*  That's why. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=100.44s)]
*  So you bring the chairman here who's not involved in politics. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=101.44s)]
*  He doesn't do politics. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=103.72s)]
*  That's my lane to understand and translate and talk about those types of things. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=105.28s)]
*  So I can use the word obliterated. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=108.6s)]
*  He could use defeat, destroyed, assess all of those things. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=110.36s)]
*  But ultimately we're here to clarify what these weapons are capable of, which anyone [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=113.16s)]
*  with two ears, two eyes, some ears and a brain can recognize that kind of firepower with [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=117.44s)]
*  that specificity at that location and others is going to have a devastating effect. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=123.64s)]
*  We have team coverage of Hexed's comments with CBS News White House reporter Olivia [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=129.72s)]
*  Rodali. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=133.84s)]
*  But first, let's get to CBS News Chief Senior National Correspondent Charlie Dagna at the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=134.84s)]
*  Pentagon for us. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=139.2s)]
*  Charlie, I know you were at that news conference. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=141.04s)]
*  Hexed, there seemed very annoyed, very fiery news conference. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  What stood out to you? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=146.72s)]
*  Hey, Mugo. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=148.72s)]
*  Well, first of all, that was the defense secretary on offense. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=149.72s)]
*  He spent the first 10 minutes tearing into the media for what he called our hate for [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  President Trump and for intentionally undermining the administration's line that the strikes [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  obliterated. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=164.2s)]
*  That's his word. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=165.48s)]
*  That's President Trump's word. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=166.48s)]
*  The Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=168.0s)]
*  And I have to repeat, those initial assessments, which we've been reporting, they come from [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=169.96s)]
*  here and they have already warned that those are preliminary and low confidence and came [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=174.5s)]
*  from the secretary's own defense department. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=178.94s)]
*  So he then listed a number of various assessments from other areas, the IAEA notably, the Israelis [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=181.36s)]
*  and the CIA citing credible evidence. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  When I push a little further on what that means or what it looks like or when we might [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  get it, this is what he had to say. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=194.10000000000002s)]
*  I was reading from the CIA director's statement, which came out last night. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=196.92s)]
*  CIA, again, they do the BDA, they do the assessment. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=201.32s)]
*  CIA can confirm that a body of credible intelligence indicates, it also goes on to say new intelligence [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=205.32s)]
*  from historically reliable and accurate sources and methods. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=210.64s)]
*  Now you can imagine the CIA director is going to be very careful about how he articulates [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  things of that sensitivity, classified, secret, top secret, compartmentalized. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=220.39999999999998s)]
*  He's going to know things that you're not going to know, that the press isn't going [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=225.48s)]
*  to know. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=228.56s)]
*  And he's reflecting that the sources he's seeing are highly credible. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=229.56s)]
*  I just wanted to know when we were going to know. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=236.12s)]
*  But as he quoted, the CIA director, John Radcliffe said the strikes had severely damaged Iran's [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=239.28s)]
*  nuclear sites. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=243.56s)]
*  The strikes had damaged the sites. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=245.32s)]
*  And that initial report by the Defense Intelligence Agency was based on preliminary assessments [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=248.04s)]
*  and has since been outdated. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=253.2s)]
*  I'll read that statement for you again. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=255.84s)]
*  It reads in part, CIA can confirm that a body of credible evidence indicates Iran's nuclear [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=257.84s)]
*  program has been severely damaged by the recent targeted strikes. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=262.0s)]
*  This includes new intelligence from a historically reliable, accurate source method, etc., etc., [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=265.6s)]
*  etc. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=270.32s)]
*  The reason we repeat that is because that's as close as we have to a summation of the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=271.32s)]
*  damage of what's gone on in Iran. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=275.96s)]
*  It was also put to the secretary, and he didn't answer it, that why when the Joint Chiefs [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=279.44s)]
*  of Staff, General Cain, presented that initial report, which was on Sunday, which is the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=285.24s)]
*  day after, he said it's going to take a few days. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=289.64s)]
*  And that first report that we saw, that initial assessment, that came within about maybe 24 [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=292.2s)]
*  hours of then. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=297.6s)]
*  And we have been reporting it, CNN, New York Times, etc. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=298.6s)]
*  We've all reported that out. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=301.52s)]
*  But it is a preliminary report, which means we need to get more intelligence. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=302.76s)]
*  And if the CIA and others have got that intelligence, even if, I understand that there are going [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  to be operational security issues around that, they're going to want to keep some of that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  classified, but give us some broad strokes. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=317.48s)]
*  Give us an idea of the level of the destruction, how certain we can be. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=321.08000000000004s)]
*  It's worth pointing out, by the way, that General Cain, he gave us a sort of tick-tock [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  of the B2s delivering their weaponry. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=329.0s)]
*  The first one, in both of the attacks, because there were 12, took off, blasted the cement [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=332.32s)]
*  caps off, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, went down the shafts. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=338.52s)]
*  They all deployed as was expected. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=342.24s)]
*  And they know that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=344.4s)]
*  That is gettable data and evidence. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=345.4s)]
*  And then they put a sixth one in. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=348.65999999999997s)]
*  It's called a flex bomb, just in case any of the other ones didn't work. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=350.24s)]
*  And all of those delivered, they reached their target, and they detonated in the exact place [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=353.52s)]
*  that they should have. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=359.18s)]
*  So we know what happened. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=360.24s)]
*  We just don't know the damage caused by it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=361.96000000000004s)]
*  And really, Charlie, that's part of my next question, because we know the secretary took [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=365.52s)]
*  the time to hold this news conference today. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=369.24s)]
*  So did we learn anything new or substantial about the strikes, or was it really just a [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  chance for him to go on the offensive here? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=377.32s)]
*  I think it was a chance for him to vent. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=381.3s)]
*  I kind of get the impression that he needed to address this, which is why it was sort [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=383.36s)]
*  of a scramble to get this together. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=388.82s)]
*  We had heard rumors that we might get a briefing today. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=390.42s)]
*  It's only the second one we've had, so this is a rare occasion. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=392.74s)]
*  So he obviously had a message to share. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=396.26s)]
*  But in terms of any actual evidence, no. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=399.18s)]
*  We got two satellite images of the penetration points, which we kind of already had, but [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=401.86s)]
*  General Cain walked us through what we were looking at. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=407.3s)]
*  We didn't see any level of destruction. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=410.26s)]
*  We didn't see what you and I have seen sometimes. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=412.5s)]
*  You see that cockpit camera? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=414.24s)]
*  When a bomb is delivered or an airstrike is delivered, you sometimes see the crosshairs. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=416.6s)]
*  Now I know that the B-2s are inherently secretive, obviously. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=421.92s)]
*  It's a classified weapons platform. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=425.68s)]
*  It's a classified bomber, so there are all kinds of reasons that they might be sensitive [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=428.24s)]
*  about that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=431.56s)]
*  But yes, the press wants to know, the American people want to know, what was the level of [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=433.08s)]
*  destruction in Iran? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=439.04s)]
*  And we still don't have any clues or answers closer to answering that question. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=440.04s)]
*  We'll see if we ever get clues or answers on that one. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=444.44s)]
*  Charlie Dagata at the Pentagon for us. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=447.52000000000004s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time today. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  Now let's bring in Olivia Bernalde. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=452.04s)]
*  She is here with us today once again this morning afternoon at this time in New York [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=454.08000000000004s)]
*  City. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=458.72s)]
*  Olivia, thank you for your time. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=459.72s)]
*  How is the president responding to the news conference at the Pentagon earlier today? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=461.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm sure he was happy to see Hegsath really just tell reporters and correspondents out [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=465.28s)]
*  there that they were wrong. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, Mugah, we know the president was watching this press conference very closely. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=473.64s)]
*  Shortly after it finished, he fired off a truth social where he called it one of the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=479.28s)]
*  greatest, most professional, and most quote confirming news conferences the president [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=483.0s)]
*  has ever seen. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=488.2s)]
*  Also in that truth social saying that people in the fake news should be quote fired for [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=489.2s)]
*  being involved in this quote witch hunt. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=493.68s)]
*  So we know the president watching it very closely and this is the type of thing he likes. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=496.52000000000004s)]
*  He likes someone who's going to be a strong fighter for his agenda. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=500.44s)]
*  That's certainly what we saw from the secretary of defense today when he came out very strong [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=504.8s)]
*  against reporters as Charlie just expertly laid out for you there. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=508.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=513.2s)]
*  And so I want to pivot to a different question here because we know that in just a few hours [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=514.2s)]
*  the president is hosting an event at the White House. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=517.88s)]
*  This is being called the one big beautiful event, which obviously plays off of the one [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=520.96s)]
*  big beautiful bill. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=526.0400000000001s)]
*  What are we watching for from that event? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=527.0400000000001s)]
*  Well this is going to be an event touting the one big beautiful bill as the Senate is [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=531.5600000000001s)]
*  really working through the crux and the issues that they have with this big bill. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=536.4s)]
*  The president wants it signed by July 4th. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=542.0400000000001s)]
*  That's in eight days. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=544.52s)]
*  Washington things can move fast. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=547.2s)]
*  They don't move that fast. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=549.0s)]
*  So this is kind of an event that's twofold really. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=551.0s)]
*  One it's to celebrate what this bill is supposed to do, which the president says it's going [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=554.4799999999999s)]
*  to provide tax cuts for Americans. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=558.92s)]
*  Those no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, things that he campaigned on. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=561.3199999999999s)]
*  So one it's going to celebrate that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=565.66s)]
*  But two it's going to apply pressure to those GOP holdouts. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=567.0s)]
*  I'm looking at Senator Tom Tillis of North Carolina, Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=570.76s)]
*  several other Republican senators who are worried about Medicaid cuts, how this would [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=576.2s)]
*  impact rural hospitals. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=580.96s)]
*  So the bottom line is this event that's going to happen today is really serving as kind [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=582.84s)]
*  of a twofold for this White House. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=587.1600000000001s)]
*  One, look how great this big beautiful bill is. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=588.88s)]
*  And two, to our friends in Congress, you better get it signed soon, or get it passed soon [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=590.88s)]
*  rather so the president can sign it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=595.88s)]
*  So that's kind of where we're at today for this event that's going to happen at the White [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=597.76s)]
*  House later on. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=601.08s)]
*  Certainly seems like the president has a clear message for that one. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=602.88s)]
*  Olivia Rinaldi in Washington, D.C. for us today. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=606.04s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WalzisHPc&t=608.0s)]
