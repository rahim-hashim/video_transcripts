# Biden addresses what's next in Middle East conflict after Yahya Sinwar's death
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek)
*  Welcome back. Our video monitors just caught President Joe Biden leaving Germany, but he did manage to speak to the press before boarding Air Force One. Watch from just moments ago. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=0.0s)]
*  Can you give us a sense about the Middle East peace? You said it's going to be harder. Do you have any sense of a timeline? Are you putting more pressure on Netanyahu? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=11.0s)]
*  It was an opportunity in my view and my colleagues' agree that Egypt probably deal with Israel and Iran in a way that ends the conflict for a while. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=21.0s)]
*  It ends the conflict. In other words, it stops the back and forth. We think that there's a possibility of working to cease fire in Lebanon. And it's going to be harder in Gaza, but we agree that there has to be an outcome. What happens the day after this? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=40.0s)]
*  Do you have a good understanding right now what Israel is going to do in response to Iran's October 1st attacks and when they will actually respond to Iran? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=56.0s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=66.0s)]
*  Do you have any concerns about the upcoming American election? Are your fellow leaders worried? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=67.0s)]
*  They're happy. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=77.0s)]
*  Did you get reassurance from Netanyahu yesterday on your phone calls that no willing clung to the table on his teeth's fire? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=79.0s)]
*  We're in the middle of a discussion about that. We're not still not convening that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=87.0s)]
*  But suppose if there's any chance that you would on Ukraine, that you would change your mind on long-range webbings allowing them to strike Kiberin to Russia, which is one of the main proposals that you put out? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=92.0s)]
*  Foreign policy, there's never a... well, it never changed my mind. Right now, there's no consensus on long-range webbings. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=104.0s)]
*  What would have to happen to get a change of mind on that? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=112.0s)]
*  I'm not going to speculate. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=114.0s)]
*  What's the consensus on the Ukraine victory plan? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=115.0s)]
*  From the VOD meeting. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=118.0s)]
*  The consensus on the Ukraine victory plan? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=119.0s)]
*  We're going to stay with Ukraine. We're going to make sure they continue to have takeability. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=121.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=125.0s)]
*  President Joe Biden speaking to the media there just before boarding Air Force One in Berlin. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=126.0s)]
*  He said there is a possibility of starting up those ceasefire talks now that Yaya Sinwar is dead. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=132.0s)]
*  We're going to stay on top of that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMSsuSRGek&t=138.0s)]
