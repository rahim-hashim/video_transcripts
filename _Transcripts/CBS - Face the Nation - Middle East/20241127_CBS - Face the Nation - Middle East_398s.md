# With a Hezbollah ceasefire holding, what's next in the Israel-Hamas war?
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g)
*  President Biden says his administration is making, quote, another push to end the war [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=0.0s)]
*  in Gaza after the U.S. helped broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, a ceasefire [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=5.04s)]
*  that took effect today. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=9.8s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Deborah Pata has more from Jerusalem. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=11.48s)]
*  Israel and Hezbollah exchanged heavy fire until the very last moment before the ceasefire [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=16.4s)]
*  began. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  But from early this morning, the skies were quiet for the first time in more than a year. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  After the agreement, Israel must withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah retreat north of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=29.4s)]
*  the Laitani River, while Lebanese troops and U.N. forces keep the peace. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=35.0s)]
*  Despite official warnings that it's still too dangerous to go home, thousands of displaced [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=42.04s)]
*  Lebanese strapped their belongings onto their cars and headed south, almost as quickly as [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=48.16s)]
*  they'd fled the violence before. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=54.08s)]
*  So many found that they had lost everything. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  Across the border, Israelis evacuated from the northern Kiryat Shmona were also reeling [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  from the losses of war, and people are worried there that the truce will be breached. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  There is distrust on both sides. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  It's going to be a tense 60 days waiting to see if this ceasefire holds. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=75.72s)]
*  This deal has also revived hope for a Gaza ceasefire, but a former Israeli military intelligence [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=82.16000000000001s)]
*  officer told us he's convinced Israel will not be leaving the Palestinian territory for [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=88.48s)]
*  a very long time. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=94.68s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much, Deborah Patzah. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  CBS News contributor Robert Berger joins us now from Jerusalem. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=99.16s)]
*  Robert, thank you very much. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=102.72s)]
*  What does this Hezbollah peace deal for Lebanon mean for Gaza? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=104.44s)]
*  Any impact? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=109.04s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=111.04s)]
*  I think, you know, Hamas has been isolated now because Hezbollah is no longer part of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=112.04s)]
*  the fight. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=118.48s)]
*  Hamas's strategy all along, according to U.S. and Israeli officials, was to try and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=119.48s)]
*  turn this into a regional war, and they really succeeded for a while. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  Israel and Iran have traded direct blows for the first time in history this year, a couple [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=130.08s)]
*  of times with ballistic missiles and airstrikes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  And now Iran, who is the sponsor of Hezbollah, is basically out because Hezbollah is out. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=139.6s)]
*  So that leaves Hamas on its own now to deal with the war with Israel that's been going [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  on for more than a year. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=153.48s)]
*  Perhaps they'll be more likely to move toward a deal. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=155.24s)]
*  That's the hope anyway. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  So what are the obstacles or at least what are the greatest obstacles between Israel [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=159.76s)]
*  and Hamas getting to this agreement? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=164.16s)]
*  The obstacles are the same as they have been all year. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=167.04s)]
*  Hamas is demanding a complete end to the war, not a ceasefire, which has been basically [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=170.0s)]
*  what U.S. and other mediators like Qatar and Egypt were trying to get, was a phase deal [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=177.24s)]
*  starting with a six-week ceasefire. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=184.04s)]
*  Hamas wants a complete end to the war, permanent end to the war, and an Israeli pullout from [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=186.08s)]
*  Gaza to win the release of those about 101 hostages still left in Gaza. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  Israel refuses to agree to that because the stated aim of the war is to destroy Hamas. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=198.24s)]
*  And that hasn't happened yet. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=205.16s)]
*  Does President Biden leaving office change the calculus here at all or the recipe towards [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=207.76s)]
*  success? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=212.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's sort of a two. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=215.12s)]
*  It could go either way because Israel, President Trump, President-elect Trump has urged Israel [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=218.32s)]
*  to end this war quickly. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=225.84s)]
*  So on the one hand, Israel could say, well, let's try to end this and get a ceasefire [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=227.6s)]
*  with Gaza before Mr. Trump comes in, in order that he doesn't have to deal with that as [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=232.8s)]
*  soon as he takes office. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=238.62s)]
*  On the other hand, maybe Israel would wait and hold that ceasefire deal for when Mr. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=240.68s)]
*  Trump does take office as to give him the diplomatic victory instead of the Biden administration. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=247.16s)]
*  Remember, we've seen quite a bit of tension between the U.S. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=253.88s)]
*  and Israel over Israel's handling of the war. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=256.88s)]
*  The 60 days that's been built into this ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah seems [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=261.32s)]
*  to be a lot of runway, a lot of green in front of the combatants. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=268.08s)]
*  Is there any concern it won't hold for two months? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=272.92s)]
*  Of course, there's certainly that concern. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  Let's just say that today we got off to a good start. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  The ceasefire has now held for one day. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  It's supposed to go for 60 days, what they call the temporary ceasefire, with a gradual [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=288.88s)]
*  Israeli pullout from Lebanon. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=293.76s)]
*  And Hezbollah is supposed to move 18 miles north of the Israeli border to the Latani, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=296.64s)]
*  north of the Latani River. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=301.36s)]
*  Let me just say that it seems to be in the interest of both Israel and Hezbollah to make [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=303.44s)]
*  this work. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=309.6s)]
*  Israeli forces are exhausted after 14 months of war, including both fighting in both Gaza [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=310.72s)]
*  and Lebanon. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=317.32s)]
*  They're running short of munitions. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=318.32s)]
*  While Hezbollah has suffered severe blows from Israel, including the assassination of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  its top leaders. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=325.88s)]
*  So it seems to be in the interest of both sides right now to make this work. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  Domestically here in the U.S., it's hard to escape this bottom line question. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  What are the prospects for there being real progress overall in the Middle East before [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=335.44s)]
*  January 20th, before the next president takes over? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=339.24s)]
*  Well, you know, it's kind of dangerous. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=343.12s)]
*  We've learned over the past year or so that timetables for a deal or for a ceasefire, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=347.68s)]
*  it's kind of dangerous to make a prediction. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  Back in March, President Biden said that he expected that there was going to be a deal [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=357.08s)]
*  in a week. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=362.28s)]
*  That was eight months ago. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=363.68s)]
*  And then Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, maybe two, three months ago said, well, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=365.68s)]
*  we're at the 10-yard line, only 10 yards to go, and we still don't have a deal. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=370.4s)]
*  So I think we're going to try and see some creative diplomacy by the U.S. and mediators [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=375.64s)]
*  like Qatar and Egypt to try and get things moving again. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=380.76s)]
*  But it's hard to predict how long this will take. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=385.0s)]
*  We're grateful for your service and your reporting and for staying up so very late for us tonight. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=387.92s)]
*  Robert Berger from Jerusalem, thank you very much. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=393.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kUiQpQCu_g&t=396.84s)]
