# Details on calls to end controversial Gaza aid program backed by U.S. and Israel
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [July 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0)
*  More than 170 non-governmental organizations operating in Gaza have called for the immediate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=0.0s)]
*  end of the U.S. and Israeli backday distribution scheme. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=5.94s)]
*  In their joint statement, the organizations say that in less than four weeks, more than [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=10.08s)]
*  500 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 4,000 injured while trying to access or distribute [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  food. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=20.8s)]
*  It comes after the U.N. agency supporting Palestinian refugees called the Gaza Humanitarian [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=21.8s)]
*  Foundation a, quote, death trap. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=27.28s)]
*  We have reached out to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation for a new comment, but in a statement [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=30.12s)]
*  provided to CBS News last week, it said in part, quote, it is unfortunate that both organizations, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=34.9s)]
*  especially the U.N., continue to push false information regarding our operations. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  We understand the U.N. is also trying to deliver aid into Gaza, but are not releasing the percentage [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=47.08s)]
*  of their deliveries that are being looted versus making their final destination. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=52.9s)]
*  Joining me now is Juliet Tuma, the Director of Communications for the United Nations Relief [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=58.98s)]
*  and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=63.58s)]
*  Juliet, thank you for joining us. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=66.42s)]
*  I want to start off with finding out what is your team's assessment of how the Gaza [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=68.74s)]
*  Humanitarian Foundation is operating on the ground. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=73.74s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=78.82s)]
*  And good to see you. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=79.82s)]
*  Look, our teams, since day one, they've been telling us that it's not humanitarian at all, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=81.74s)]
*  that it is the Gaza Hunger Foundation, it is the Gaza Humiliation Foundation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=88.1s)]
*  And what they mean by that is that it's extremely degrading how this scheme of aid distribution [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=95.17999999999999s)]
*  has been operating. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=104.78s)]
*  The many, many miles that people have to go starving people, men and women, only to get [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=108.46000000000001s)]
*  very, very little food. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=116.02s)]
*  And on top of that, they get shot at. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=117.62s)]
*  Juliet, there used to be 400 sites run by independent aid groups across Gaza. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=120.54s)]
*  Now, with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation taking the lead, it's down to just four. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=125.42s)]
*  How big of an impact has that had? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=130.46s)]
*  On a good day, it's four. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=134.62s)]
*  And you're absolutely right. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=137.26000000000002s)]
*  We used to run in coordination with other United Nations agencies and humanitarian organizations [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=139.14000000000001s)]
*  around 400 points of distribution spread across the Gaza Strip from north to south. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=146.62s)]
*  And the whole point about this is that we wanted to be close to the people that we're [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=154.26000000000002s)]
*  serving so that older people, the wounded, people with disabilities, women, children, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=160.46s)]
*  don't have to walk for miles and end. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=167.26000000000002s)]
*  And that's the whole point is that we're close to the communities that we're serving. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=170.86s)]
*  Juliet, you're well aware your organization has faced criticism from Israeli Prime Minister [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=175.34s)]
*  Netanyahu and President Trump, who have alleged UNRWA staff were linked to the Hamas, to Hamas [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=180.46s)]
*  and its October 7th attack. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=186.62s)]
*  Accusations your organization has denied. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=188.46s)]
*  Now, the U.S. was once the biggest donor to UNRWA, but the Trump administration has announced [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=191.34s)]
*  widespread cuts to foreign aid. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=196.62s)]
*  What has that done and how is it affecting your operation? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=199.02s)]
*  A huge impact. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=204.22s)]
*  The United States government and the American people have been the largest donor to our [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=205.42000000000002s)]
*  organization, to UNRWA, for decades on end, for more than 70 years. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=214.46s)]
*  So the loss of the funding coming from the American people and the American government [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=222.38s)]
*  left us really bare, if you wish. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=229.10000000000002s)]
*  We're struggling to make ends meet. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=233.98000000000002s)]
*  We go hand to mouth. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=236.86s)]
*  We can barely make do with what we have. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=239.02s)]
*  It's an extremely difficult situation. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=243.9s)]
*  With the American funding that we used to get, we used to send lots and lots of assistance [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=247.26000000000002s)]
*  to Gaza, but also to other parts where we work, including Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=253.58s)]
*  the occupied West Bank. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=260.14s)]
*  The U.S. funding amounted to nearly $400 million. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=262.7s)]
*  That was almost half of our operational budget. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=267.26s)]
*  We lost that very precious funding at the beginning of 2024 based on allegations that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=270.86s)]
*  were never proven. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=280.86s)]
*  We don't have a lot of time left, but I just want to get your take on the toll that it [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=282.78000000000003s)]
*  has taken on your staff. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=288.3s)]
*  You've lost at least 300 of your staff since the start of the war. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=289.58000000000004s)]
*  How do you continue forward? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=294.3s)]
*  Over 320, to be precise. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=296.62s)]
*  These are doctors, nurses, emergency workers, drivers, the backbone of the humanitarian [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=301.18s)]
*  operation in Gaza. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=308.3s)]
*  It's a huge loss. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=310.38s)]
*  It's the largest human toll since the United Nations started working at the end of the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=311.5s)]
*  Second World War. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=318.62s)]
*  Juliet Tuma, thank you so much for your time. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=320.53999999999996s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7AKq8eN0&t=322.53999999999996s)]
