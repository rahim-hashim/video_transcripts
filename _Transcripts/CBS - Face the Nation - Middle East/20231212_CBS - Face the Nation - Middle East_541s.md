# Why Biden's handling of Israel-Hamas war could cost him votes in 2024
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10)
*  A new CBS News poll is showing us what Americans think now about the economy and the war in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=0.0s)]
*  the Middle East, with major implications for 2024. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=5.44s)]
*  Just 38 percent approve of President Biden's handling of the economy, and most Americans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=9.48s)]
*  also say the condition of the economy is bad, despite recent positive economic news. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=14.76s)]
*  CBS News executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto, joins us now [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=21.92s)]
*  to break it down. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=26.36s)]
*  Hey, Anthony, how are you? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=27.36s)]
*  Hey, Nancy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=28.36s)]
*  Yeah, so the Biden administration is saying unemployment is down, wages are up, inflation [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=29.84s)]
*  is way down, but you found that many Americans simply still feel lousy about inflation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=34.0s)]
*  Yeah, simplest answer is usually best. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=40.68s)]
*  So look at this. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=42.72s)]
*  Is your income keeping pace with inflation? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=43.72s)]
*  And three-quarters say no, it's not. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  So while those national job numbers, which people say are good, are there, while the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  inflation is slowing, the prices they're paying for goods are still high. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=53.76s)]
*  And so that's how you get here, that they don't feel like they're able to keep up. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=59.64s)]
*  Now I'll add this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=63.68s)]
*  When the White House talks about those national numbers, we ask, you and I have talked about [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=65.12s)]
*  this, what is it that people weigh when they evaluate them? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=69.64s)]
*  Well, the national data, OK, two-thirds of people say they look at that, but look how [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  much higher they rate their own experiences. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  And so that's the people that they know what's happening to them and businesses in their [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  community. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=85.84s)]
*  That's the close, that's the personal, and that's what goes into these metrics even more, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=86.84s)]
*  Nancy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=91.76s)]
*  And certainly if you're looking to get a car loan or a mortgage, you don't feel like things [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=92.76s)]
*  are getting better. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=95.76s)]
*  Anthony, what are Americans saying about their chances of getting ahead in this economy? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=96.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's so important, and it's something that we found in the polls really stands out, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=101.2s)]
*  in their key earning years, Gen Xers, Millennials, they feel like their standard of living is [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=106.72s)]
*  worse than their parents was at this same time in their lives. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=112.84s)]
*  That runs a little counter to what we traditionally think of as the American dream, right, that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=117.56s)]
*  you're going to be better off. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=120.88s)]
*  And that's really a function coming out of the pandemic. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=123.12s)]
*  We've seen people compare the way things were pre-pandemic and then afterwards, and in this [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=126.08s)]
*  poll people tell us they feel like what the economy went through during the pandemic, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=131.56s)]
*  during the shutdowns, and then this inflationary period afterwards has really left a mark and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=136.4s)]
*  it's still lingering in how people feel and how they compare to their past, to the past [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=142.08s)]
*  before that pandemic. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=148.4s)]
*  Right, and so the White House is hoping that people's attitudes about the economy are going [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=149.88s)]
*  to change, they're going to have to wait a little longer. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=154.44s)]
*  You also took a look, Anthony, at how Americans are feeling about the Israel-Hamas war, and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=157.0s)]
*  that's fascinating. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  What did they say? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  I did. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  Because people start with results when they make these evaluations, you get this bulk [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=165.2s)]
*  of people saying the administration isn't having an impact in bringing the conflict [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  to a peaceful resolution. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=174.48s)]
*  After that, his handling overall has gone down. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=176.56s)]
*  But I would also point out this, Nancy, within the Democratic Party, we talked about some [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  divisions there, we've got an increase from 28 to 38 in the number of Democrats who feel [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=185.32s)]
*  like Biden is showing too much support for Israel. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  I want to keep an eye on that because, of course, for any president, having that unified [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=196.04s)]
*  party behind them in their approach to foreign policy, always critical, Nancy. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=200.08s)]
*  Yeah, it really demonstrates the shifting opinions about this conflict and about Israel [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  and the Palestinians. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=209.84s)]
*  Anthony Salvanto, thanks so much. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=210.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=212.8s)]
*  President Biden's unwavering support for Israel could also cost him some support in the important [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=214.6s)]
*  swing state of Michigan. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=219.32s)]
*  PBS' Edo Keefe spoke with Arab-Americans there about the president's reelection bid. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  You voted against Donald Trump in 2020. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=226.60000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=229.8s)]
*  You would skip voting for president in 2024. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=230.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=233.44s)]
*  Even if it meant Donald Trump might win the presidency. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=234.44s)]
*  If you were to tell me that my vote would be the vote whether Biden wins in Michigan [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  or not, I will still not vote for Biden. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  It's that much of an issue for you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=245.24s)]
*  Yeah, my people dying is that much of an issue for me. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  Wow, Edo Keefe and Bo Eriksson join us now. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=251.0s)]
*  Ed is CBS News senior White House and political correspondent. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=253.96s)]
*  Bo is a CBS News White House reporter. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=257.4s)]
*  Good to have you both here. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=260.36s)]
*  It's a White House reunion. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=261.36s)]
*  And Ed, I'm going to start with you because that was a really fascinating clip that you [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=263.08s)]
*  played. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=266.24s)]
*  Arab-Americans make up I think about 3 percent of the population in Michigan, but they went [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=267.24s)]
*  overwhelmingly for President Biden in 2020. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=272.52s)]
*  And so a loss of this group among this group in 2024 could cost him in a swing state. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=275.08s)]
*  It could. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  Consider this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  The president won Michigan in 2020 by about 150,000 votes. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  About 146,000 Muslims living in Michigan voted in 2020. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=286.04s)]
*  So that right there, if conceivably, as Adam told us, most of his neighborhood, many of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=292.0s)]
*  his friends were to stay home or at least leave that question on the ballot blank, could [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  be robbing the president of the margins he needs to win. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's what's so concerning either side of this is if you're looking at a turnout [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=304.64s)]
*  game in November next year, you have to turn out everyone you possibly can find. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  Right now, this group of voters in a key swing state is telling the Biden campaign, stay [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  away. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=318.12s)]
*  Donald Trump was bad because he supported the Muslim travel ban, said a lot of derogatory [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=319.12s)]
*  things about Arab or Muslim-Americans. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=323.04s)]
*  But President Biden is supporting an Israeli government that is killing tens of thousands [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=325.32s)]
*  of their neighbors, their friends, their relatives, and they can't stand for it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=329.24s)]
*  And the White House has made sure to emphasize, especially recently, all the humanitarian [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=333.44s)]
*  aid they're providing to the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=337.76s)]
*  But it sounds like that may not be quite enough to sway this group. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=340.76s)]
*  Bo, you were in Las Vegas Friday over the weekend covering the president there and you [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=345.48s)]
*  spoke to some voters. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=349.88s)]
*  What did they have to tell you? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=350.88s)]
*  So the president has been holding a lot of events at union halls. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=352.12s)]
*  It really kind of revs up the crowd. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=355.44s)]
*  There's kind of built-in audience for the president. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=358.03999999999996s)]
*  And then this allows the president kind of talk about his middle class credibility. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=360.44s)]
*  And I was asking a lot of the voters there how they thought the economy was doing, and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=364.44s)]
*  we can listen to some of that sound. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=367.96s)]
*  My family, like every other family, has had to pinch pennies to adapt to the rising prices. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=370.24s)]
*  But at the same time, I know that the employment numbers have been strong, and so there's always [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=378.12s)]
*  a flip side to the coin. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=382.0s)]
*  Yesterday I was stopped in the grocery store because mayonnaise was $7. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=383.48s)]
*  And it was hard for me not to say a lot of this is because of corporate greed. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=388.28s)]
*  So those may be Vegas prices for the mayonnaise. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=395.44s)]
*  $7 for mayonnaise. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=397.96s)]
*  But I think these are Democratic voters. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=399.84s)]
*  They supported President Biden in 2020. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=401.84s)]
*  And they're kind of hinting on some of this pressure that they're under. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=404.79999999999995s)]
*  And that woman, her name is Margie, she kind of underscored the current political calculus, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=407.9s)]
*  I think, when it comes to a lot of these Democratic voters. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=412.11999999999995s)]
*  She's thinking next November, she said, whether Democrats are mad at Joe Biden, they're going [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=415.12s)]
*  to be more mad at Donald Trump. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  And even if they have to hold their nose, they're going to support Joe Biden. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=421.92s)]
*  She's a local Democrat activist, so she's still feeling confident. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=425.2s)]
*  Is that what the White House is banking on? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=428.32s)]
*  It is. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=430.24s)]
*  That these voters will come home at the end of the day? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=431.24s)]
*  It is. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=432.24s)]
*  And it's why I kind of am intrigued by that is that Adam, who you saw there earlier, had [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=433.24s)]
*  said to me, if you asked me two months ago before the conflict began what I would do, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=437.04s)]
*  he said, I will, quote, hold my nose and vote for Joe Biden because he's not happy about [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=442.12s)]
*  the economy. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=446.12s)]
*  Now, of course, he's got that other issue. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=447.12s)]
*  So what the Biden campaign is trying to do, they've rolled out about a $25 million TV [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=448.5s)]
*  ad campaign, at least initially in the swing states. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=452.6s)]
*  Most of those ads focused on the economy, most of them starring what we would call real [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=456.0s)]
*  people, not the president or the vice president, but people talking about how prices lower [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=459.8s)]
*  for insulin or for their prescription drugs have helped them in their bottom lines. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=464.78000000000003s)]
*  That speaks to something we found in the poll, which is about eight and 10 plus Americans [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=469.04s)]
*  say the way they're measuring economic health and viability right now is from personal experience [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=473.44s)]
*  or what is happening to their spouse or their neighbors or their friends, not economic data [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=478.48s)]
*  like a lower unemployment rate and declining inflation, which is what the White House is [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=483.8s)]
*  constantly talking about. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=487.40000000000003s)]
*  So they realize they've got to make a more personal connection with these voters to win [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=488.70000000000005s)]
*  them back. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=491.86s)]
*  It's a lagging indicator. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=492.86s)]
*  Bo, you had some really interesting reporting today about the Biden campaign's fundraising [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=493.86s)]
*  efforts. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=499.0s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=500.0s)]
*  So looking under kind of the hood of this fundraising machine, there is some concern [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=501.0s)]
*  by top donors who are saying that the White House and the president hasn't really been [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=504.28s)]
*  engaged to the level that they should have been the past three years. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=509.44s)]
*  And so one donor is telling me now that it's go time, the campaign is like, where is everybody [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=512.88s)]
*  at? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=517.66s)]
*  So I asked the Biden campaign about this and they said this may be a little bit more isolated [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=518.92s)]
*  criticism. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=522.88s)]
*  And they point to the seventy two million dollars and the seventy one million dollars [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=523.88s)]
*  that the president has raised in the past six months. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=528.28s)]
*  He's doing a lot of fundraising this week. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=530.52s)]
*  He's been the thirty six fundraiser since relaunching his campaign in April. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=532.52s)]
*  Ed O'Keefe, Bo Erickson, thanks so much. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yz-ca4h10&t=537.32s)]
