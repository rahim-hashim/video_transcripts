# CBS News tours areas of Aleppo destroyed in Syrian civil war
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc)
*  Meanwhile, an American man has been found in Syria after being freed from a prison earlier [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=0.0s)]
*  this week. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  He identified himself as Travis Timmerman from Missouri. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  He told CBS News he was detained after entering Syria without permission seven months ago. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=8.44s)]
*  On Monday, one day after rebels seized the nation's capital, two armed men allegedly [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=12.92s)]
*  broke down his prison door and he walked out. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=17.0s)]
*  He discussed what it was like to be imprisoned in Syria with CBS News senior foreign correspondent [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=19.52s)]
*  Elizabeth Palmer. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=23.84s)]
*  It wasn't bad. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=25.6s)]
*  I was never beaten. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=26.6s)]
*  The only really bad part was that I couldn't go to the bathroom when I wanted to. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=30.16s)]
*  I was only let out three times a day to go to the bathroom. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=34.84s)]
*  So that was quite the hardship. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=38.6s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent MTS Tayyab is in Aleppo with more. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=41.96s)]
*  We're here in what's left of Aleppo's ancient souk. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=48.08s)]
*  And you can just see the destruction here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=55.56s)]
*  It is breathtaking. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=58.72s)]
*  But here's the thing about Aleppo. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=61.6s)]
*  This was the seat of rebel power for years. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=66.2s)]
*  It's urban stronghold. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=69.76s)]
*  And about six years or so, Assad and his forces, along with Russia, carried out a massive [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=71.76s)]
*  campaign to rid this city of rebels, destroying so much of Aleppo's ancient history. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=80.76s)]
*  And in the years that Assad's been in power, nothing was rebuilt. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=92.4s)]
*  So much of this city remains in ruins. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=97.88000000000001s)]
*  And two weeks ago, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and its forces came in and, in their words, liberated [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  this city. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  And yet the ruins remain. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=113.2s)]
*  And the question for so many Syrians when they look at the puzzle that is their country, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  that they are going to try to piece back together again, is how do you rebuild so much of what [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  has been lost? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=128.44s)]
*  And when you look at all of this destruction, it is an enormous, enormous task. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=130.84s)]
*  But Syrians tell us that together, united, they'll be able to do it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=138.76s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  MTS Tyab, thank you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbbstNCxXZc&t=146.51999999999998s)]
