# Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks about Iran strikes
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI)
*  And actually, we're hearing a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's listen to his statement from just moments ago. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Once ago, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=7.36s)]
*  back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=14.92s)]
*  This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=19.64s)]
*  For decades, the tyrants of Tehran have brazenly, openly called for Israel's destruction. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=25.28s)]
*  They've backed up their genocidal rhetoric with a program to develop nuclear weapons. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=32.04s)]
*  In recent years, Iran has produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine atom bombs. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=37.88s)]
*  In recent months, Iran has taken steps that it has never taken before â€“ steps to weaponize [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=45.92s)]
*  this enriched uranium. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=52.36s)]
*  And if not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=54.08s)]
*  It could be a year, it could be within a few months, less than a year. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=59.24s)]
*  This is a clear and present danger to Israel's very survival. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=63.56s)]
*  Eighty years ago, the Jewish people were the victims of a Holocaust perpetrated by the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=68.24s)]
*  Nazi regime. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=73.6s)]
*  Today, the Jewish state refuses to be a victim of a nuclear Holocaust perpetrated by the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  Iranian regime. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=81.56s)]
*  Now as Prime Minister, I've made it clear time and again, Israel will never allow those [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=83.44s)]
*  who call for our annihilation to develop the means to achieve that goal. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=89.48s)]
*  Tonight, Israel backs those words with action. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=94.08s)]
*  We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment program. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=98.12s)]
*  We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear weaponization program. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=101.62s)]
*  We targeted Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=105.68s)]
*  We targeted Iran's leading nuclear scientists working on the Iranian bomb. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=109.26s)]
*  We also struck at the heart of Iran's ballistic missile program. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  Last year, Iran fired 300 ballistic missiles at Israel. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=118.42s)]
*  Each of these missiles carries a ton of explosives and threatens the lives of hundreds of people. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=122.78s)]
*  Soon, those missiles could carry a nuclear payload, threatening the lives not of hundreds, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=129.74s)]
*  but of millions. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=136.02s)]
*  Iran is gearing up to produce 10,000 of those ballistic missiles within three years. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=137.66s)]
*  Now, just imagine. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=143.62s)]
*  Imagine 10,000 tons of TNT landing on a country the size of New Jersey. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=146.38s)]
*  This is an intolerable threat. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=153.22s)]
*  It too must be stopped. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=155.3s)]
*  Iran is now working on what it calls the new plan to destroy Israel. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=157.7s)]
*  You see, the old plan failed. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=162.1s)]
*  Iran and its proxies tried to encircle Israel with a ring of fire and to attack us with [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=165.26s)]
*  the horrible attack of October 7. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=170.18s)]
*  But the people of Israel, the soldiers of Israel, rose like lions to defend our country. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=173.24s)]
*  We crushed Hamas. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=178.94s)]
*  We devastated Hezbollah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=180.18s)]
*  We hit Iranian proxies in Syria and Yemen. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=181.94s)]
*  And when Iran directly attacked us twice last year, we struck back inside Iran itself. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=184.94s)]
*  Yet in defending ourselves, we also defend others. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=190.38s)]
*  We defend our Arab neighbors. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=194.82s)]
*  They too have suffered from Iran's campaign of chaos and carnage. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=196.62s)]
*  Our actions against Iran's proxy Hezbollah led to the establishment of a new government [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=201.1s)]
*  in Lebanon and the collapse of Assad's murderous regime in Syria. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=205.9s)]
*  The peoples of those two countries now have a chance for a different future, a better [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=210.94s)]
*  future. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=215.94s)]
*  So, too, do the brave people of Iran. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=216.94s)]
*  And I have a message for them. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=219.86s)]
*  Our fight is not with you. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=222.1s)]
*  Our fight is with the brutal dictatorship that has oppressed you for 46 years. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=224.46s)]
*  I believe that the day of your liberation is near. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=230.18s)]
*  And when that happens, the great friendship between our two ancient peoples will flourish [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=233.5s)]
*  once again. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=239.06s)]
*  I want to assure the civilized world. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=240.74s)]
*  We will not let the world's most dangerous regime get the world's most dangerous weapons. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=243.46s)]
*  And Iran plans to give those weapons, nuclear weapons, to its terrorist proxies. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=249.58s)]
*  That would make the nightmare of nuclear terrorism all too real. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=254.82000000000002s)]
*  The increasing range of Iran's ballistic missiles would bring that nuclear weapon to the world. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=259.1s)]
*  And that was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu giving a statement on the airstrikes [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=265.74s)]
*  that Israel has just conducted on Iran. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=270.06s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News Chief Foreign Affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=272.7s)]
*  Margaret, I know that you are talking to your sources and gathering information. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=276.94s)]
*  What have you learned so far? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=280.3s)]
*  Yes, we've been trying to communicate with sources here in the U.S. and overseas. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=281.78s)]
*  What we know is what the Prime Minister just announced, that these were Israeli jets targeting [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=287.42s)]
*  sites within Iran that he says were related to the nuclear program that Iran has claimed [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=293.38s)]
*  for so long is entirely peaceful. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=300.65999999999997s)]
*  U.S. intelligence has been concerned about the level of highly enriched uranium that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=303.09999999999997s)]
*  Iran had stockpiled but had assessed that Iran had not yet decided to pursue a weapon [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=310.7s)]
*  and that it would take some time for them to do so. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=317.82s)]
*  In his statement there, the Prime Minister said Israel's assertion is that Iran had stockpiled [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=320.53999999999996s)]
*  enough nuclear fuel for nine weapons and that they could build one in less than a year. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=327.26000000000005s)]
*  He did not explain why he felt tonight was the night it had to be done that some of those [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=333.02000000000004s)]
*  targets were hit. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=338.38s)]
*  I do want to point out that the Secretary of State Marco Rubio has released a statement [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=340.22s)]
*  making clear the United States did not provide support in terms of offensive support to this [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=345.34000000000003s)]
*  military strike. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=350.86s)]
*  It didn't participate in it, but Israeli officials are telling me that the U.S. was aware of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=351.82s)]
*  Israel's intention on these strikes. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=359.02s)]
*  In the reporting of this throughout the day, it has been a back and forth as to when a [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=362.78000000000003s)]
*  potential strike could take place. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=367.98s)]
*  What we know at this point is just what the Israeli Prime Minister has detailed. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=370.94s)]
*  We don't know yet if this completely kills the diplomatic option that President Trump [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=375.5s)]
*  said he preferred and was sending his chief negotiator to talk to Iranian officials about [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=380.86s)]
*  this Sunday in Oman. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=385.98s)]
*  We're waiting to hear from the administration if they think that diplomacy is in any way [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=387.58000000000004s)]
*  an option. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=391.1s)]
*  Why would that still be necessary? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=392.14s)]
*  We don't know that Israel was able to actually take out the entire nuclear program. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=395.34000000000003s)]
*  Iran has underground facilities that the U.S. is uniquely positioned to be able to destroy. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=400.3s)]
*  And the U.S. has said that it would be hard for Israel to actually destroy the nuclear program [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=406.7s)]
*  without U.S. help. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=412.14s)]
*  So this may be a damage to this program, but not destruction of it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=413.58s)]
*  We'll just have to wait to see what more becomes apparent in the next few hours and days in terms [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=418.86s)]
*  of assessments of the targets hit. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=425.42s)]
*  The Prime Minister said it could last for a few days. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=428.3s)]
*  And President Trump is planning to hold a cabinet meeting tomorrow at the White House. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=431.34000000000003s)]
*  I'm curious, what are you going to be watching for in that meeting? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=434.86s)]
*  Well, I think all of us will be chasing all details we can, just as we were when we heard [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=438.62s)]
*  yesterday there was a meeting internally in the White House to try to assess options [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=443.26s)]
*  and what the U.S. would do. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=448.78000000000003s)]
*  One of the first indications we had that something might be happening imminently was the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=450.78000000000003s)]
*  announcement the Pentagon made that they were advising the dependents of military personnel [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=457.1s)]
*  in the Middle East to consider leaving. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=461.98s)]
*  And that was one of the first indications that the U.S. was concerned about blowback for the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=465.26s)]
*  United States, for its actual citizens living abroad. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=469.82s)]
*  We have to watch what happens here, including what the fallout is in the region, not just at [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=475.1s)]
*  strikes against the United States, perhaps in retaliation, but whether that could be avoided. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=481.5s)]
*  And I know that diplomats in the region and the U.N. were concerned that carrying out a military [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=486.78000000000003s)]
*  strike against a nuclear facility could have damage, a fallout, and we will need to learn more. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=493.18s)]
*  In that statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that this was all to thwart [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=500.94s)]
*  what he said was a plan from Iran to destroy Israel. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=505.58s)]
*  Another plan. Can you go into that a little bit more, what he meant by that? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=509.9s)]
*  Well, Prime Minister Netanyahu, as he said in that recorded statement in English, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=514.86s)]
*  he speaks fluent English. He went to university here. He lived here for many years. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=519.9s)]
*  He knows that when he is speaking, he is speaking not just to his citizens, but to the world to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=524.14s)]
*  explain this military action because it was preemptive. It did not have the support of other [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=528.6999999999999s)]
*  countries around the world. And in that statement, he argued that this was existential for Israel. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=534.3s)]
*  His belief has long been that Iran poses a threat if they do actually get a nuclear program [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=540.94s)]
*  that could be weaponized, that it could destroy Israel. He was arguing that. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=550.46s)]
*  But he also laid out in that speech a series of significant military actions that Israel has [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=554.62s)]
*  taken ever since that horrific attack on October 7th, nearly two years ago. And that was carried out [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=560.46s)]
*  by this Gaza-based militia, Hamas, that did receive some support from Iran. From that time on, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=569.1s)]
*  the massive intelligence failure that Israel suffered, the loss of life of 1,200 of its [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=576.78s)]
*  citizens and other nationals who were, some of them, taken hostage, he has gone through and [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=583.02s)]
*  really targeted not just Hamas, Hezbollah, another powerful militia in Lebanon. The Prime Minister [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=590.22s)]
*  pointed to that, of how he has sort of step-by-step gone through a lot of Iran's tentacles, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=596.06s)]
*  some of its proxy forces that it has used to carry out malicious behavior targeting [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=602.38s)]
*  Israelis or other Western targets, including Americans in the past. And he laid that out there [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=608.38s)]
*  saying this was sort of the next step here in trying to go directly at the Iranian regime, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=613.7399999999999s)]
*  the leaders who made those decisions to fund those other forces. So he was laying out that argument [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=620.86s)]
*  that this has been his strong belief. A number of U.S. presidents have been deeply skeptical and [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=626.86s)]
*  worried about carrying out a military strike when Prime Minister Netanyahu has tried to persuade [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=631.8199999999999s)]
*  them of it. President Trump also was skeptical, but you are hearing tonight from Israeli officials [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=637.02s)]
*  that the U.S. was given advance notice and that Secretary Rubio is just making clear the U.S. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=644.22s)]
*  doesn't want to be part of any military conflict at this point. They said they don't want to be [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=649.58s)]
*  part of any military conflict, but I want to go back to the negotiations between the U.S. and Iran [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=654.94s)]
*  over Iran's nuclear capabilities. Can you go over to go into more of what the U.S. wants Iran to do [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=659.58s)]
*  in terms of their nuclear sites? So what we know from the proposal the United States presented to [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=665.9000000000001s)]
*  the Iranian negotiators two weeks ago, this was from Steve Witkoff, the envoy who transmitted it [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=673.82s)]
*  through a middleman out of Oman, their foreign minister to the Iranians, that they just don't [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=681.82s)]
*  want Iran to have enrichment of nuclear fuel, period. Even if it was for civilian purposes, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=688.3000000000001s)]
*  the many different options laid out in that proposal really were focused on this idea of [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=695.6600000000001s)]
*  restricting Iran's ability to enrich nuclear fuel even at low levels. They had been enriching up to [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=702.7800000000001s)]
*  60 percent, close to 90 percent, which is weapons-grade. And so that was really the heart of [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=708.46s)]
*  the proposal we know the United States put forward. They gave many different options there. We aren't [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=713.6600000000001s)]
*  quite sure yet. I've reached out to Steve Witkoff, as I'm sure every other reporter in Washington's [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=719.0200000000001s)]
*  doing right now, to say, is the plan still on and is that deal still on the table? We just don't know [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=724.7s)]
*  what this will do to the diplomacy, but it certainly shows that this offer was backed up by the [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=730.3s)]
*  credible threat of force. Now, does this mean that there won't be further action by the United [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=738.78s)]
*  States down the line? We don't know. Destroying this entire program is very complicated. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=744.9399999999999s)]
*  Yes, I'm curious. You know, we have this very close alliance with Israel. Is it possible that down the [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=751.66s)]
*  road, if this escalates, that the United States may have to get involved? That has long been the [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=757.34s)]
*  concern of American presidents, that if a military strike was carried out, that there would be [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=763.5s)]
*  knock-on effects that would eventually draw the United States in. One of those concerns has been [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=770.46s)]
*  the use of Iran's proxy forces, those militias in the region, who could target U.S. service people, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=775.9s)]
*  as they have in the past, or carry out strikes. That is why Secretary Rubio was talking about [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=781.5s)]
*  trying to protect that. Now, there's a lot of reporting yet to be done here on the cost of [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=788.7s)]
*  retaliation. Iran has retaliated against Israel for, within just the past year, recall that Israel [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=794.62s)]
*  carried out strikes on Iran, but not its nuclear program. We have to see what the potential [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=803.18s)]
*  retaliation could be, or if the United States would threaten the regime itself further. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=809.4200000000001s)]
*  Margaret Brennan, I know you've got phone calls to make, emails to answer, texts to answer. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=816.3000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much for sticking with us and for giving us that insight. Sure, thank you. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPV4-6g79tI&t=820.38s)]
