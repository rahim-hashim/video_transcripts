# Hezbollah leader accuses Israel of crossing "red line" after Lebanon device explosions
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0)
*  The leader of Hezbollah is accusing Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=0.0s)]
*  of targeting thousands of people in Lebanon [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=3.04s)]
*  into coordinated attacks that turned communication devices [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=5.2s)]
*  into deadly weapons. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=9.16s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah addressed the country earlier today, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=10.48s)]
*  saying Israel crossed red lines by carrying out the attacks [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  and that the detonations, in his words, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=16.6s)]
*  were an act of war against the people of Lebanon. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=19.28s)]
*  He then vowed that Hezbollah's operations in Lebanon [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  will not stop until the war in Gaza ends. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=24.68s)]
*  Now on Tuesday, pages in the hand of alleged Hezbollah [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  operatives exploded almost simultaneously. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=31.56s)]
*  It killed 12 people and injured thousands. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=34.6s)]
*  Yesterday, Lebanon's health ministry says 20 people were killed [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  and nearly 500 wounded after walkie-talkies exploded. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=40.96s)]
*  Moments before Nasrallah's address, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  Israel launched a new wave of airstrikes [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=47.36s)]
*  against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=49.64s)]
*  Now that wave comes after the Israeli military says [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  it struck seven Hezbollah sites in overnight airstrikes [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=55.96s)]
*  in the southern part of Lebanon. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=59.24s)]
*  They say the locations were, quote, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=61.64s)]
*  terrorist infrastructure sites and one weapon storage facility. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  The escalated attacks in Lebanon are a stoking fear [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=67.4s)]
*  that they could be a preview to a wider attack. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=70.2s)]
*  US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=73.52s)]
*  says he fears that Israel may be preparing [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=75.36s)]
*  to launch a widespread ground war in Lebanon. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=77.76s)]
*  CBS News contributor Robert Berger joins us now [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=83.44s)]
*  from Jerusalem with more on all of this. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=85.8s)]
*  Robert, Nasrallah in his comments just a few moments ago [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=88.32s)]
*  also said Israel's attacks will meet, quote, just punishment. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=91.84s)]
*  The fear is this could escalate already high tensions [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=96.12s)]
*  in the region. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=99.32s)]
*  I know you watched Nasrallah's address. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=100.28s)]
*  Tell us more about what he had to say. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=102.24s)]
*  He said that Israel crossed a red line [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=105.28s)]
*  and that this pager attack amounted to a declaration of war. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=107.92s)]
*  He did acknowledge that Hezbollah suffered a severe blow, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=112.84s)]
*  but that it would continue to fight Israel. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=116.72s)]
*  His threats of retaliation, though, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  really weren't much different than what we've been hearing [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=122.56s)]
*  over the past 11 months of fighting. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=125.8s)]
*  He really didn't seem to threaten all out war with Israel, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=128.12s)]
*  which is, of course, what everyone is concerned about. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  And he also made a key point [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=135.68s)]
*  that until there's a ceasefire in Gaza, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=138.36s)]
*  Hezbollah won't stop its fire [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  on the northern border with Israel. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, and Hezbollah, I wanna just rewind for a second, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  Robert, because Hezbollah is operating out of Lebanon. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  Israel had conducted airstrikes in Lebanon overnight. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=156.0s)]
*  Talk to us both about those Israel airstrikes [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  and the way that Hezbollah operates in Lebanon. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=164.68s)]
*  And give us some more context for understanding [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=168.72s)]
*  its relationship with the government. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=171.36s)]
*  Okay, well, Hezbollah is really a state [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=175.08s)]
*  within a state in Lebanon. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=177.16000000000003s)]
*  It has a huge, powerful army, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=179.36s)]
*  much more powerful than Hamas. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=181.84s)]
*  According to the Israeli military, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=184.52s)]
*  it has 150,000 rockets, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=186.24s)]
*  as well as some precision missiles [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=189.4s)]
*  that could target all of Israel. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=192.60000000000002s)]
*  So that's the fear when you're talking about Hezbollah, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=194.44000000000003s)]
*  which is a group backed by Iran [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=198.68s)]
*  that they could unleash their huge arsenal [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=202.12s)]
*  and then the region could get plunged into an all out war. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=204.36s)]
*  But as I said, it seemed like Nasrallah [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  didn't go there in his speech, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=211.84s)]
*  but this is the concern of everyone here. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=213.56s)]
*  And meantime, Robert, you've got US Secretary of State [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=216.44s)]
*  Anthony Blinken in the region trying to get [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=218.72s)]
*  to a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  And now there's these escalations [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=223.24s)]
*  in the reporting from the region yesterday. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=225.52s)]
*  We were told Israel's moving some of its troops [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=227.28s)]
*  from Gaza to the North. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=229.72s)]
*  So speak to us more about the fear of continued escalations [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=231.84s)]
*  into what could be all out war. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=235.24s)]
*  Yeah, the Defense Minister actually said [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=239.08s)]
*  that Israel is entering a new phase of the war [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=241.56s)]
*  and that the focus is moving from the South in Gaza, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=244.8s)]
*  where we've seen fighting for the past 11 months [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  and moving to the North. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  And we have seen troop movements in that direction. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=252.56s)]
*  We've seen tanks and armored personnel carriers going there. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  A top commando unit has been moved to the North. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=259.52s)]
*  Now the question everyone is asking [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=263.2s)]
*  is if this pager attack, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=265.52s)]
*  the explosion of 3,000 pagers in Lebanon, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=267.88s)]
*  if that is just the opening round [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  of a full scale Israeli assault on Lebanon [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=274.8s)]
*  or simply a warning to Hezbollah to stop [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=277.52s)]
*  while there's still time. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=283.36s)]
*  And Robert, to that point, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=285.8s)]
*  we are coming up on the one year, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=287.64s)]
*  I don't wanna say anniversary, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  cause that's not quite right, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=293.72s)]
*  but one year since that incendiary moment, October 7th, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=294.92s)]
*  when Hamas launched an attack against Israeli civilians [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=299.92s)]
*  that started this current round of fighting. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  So what does it signal that Israel appears to be shifting [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=310.52s)]
*  its strategy from Gaza and Hamas to the North and Hezbollah? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=313.72s)]
*  Yeah, after 11 months of fighting, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, to be honest, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=323.0s)]
*  there doesn't seem to be any end in sight. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  The focus is now turning toward Lebanon, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=327.92s)]
*  even though the Gaza war is nowhere near finished, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=330.52000000000004s)]
*  you have daily clashes there [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=334.36s)]
*  between Israeli forces and Hamas. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=336.24s)]
*  And the question is, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=340.12s)]
*  if Israel is moving its focus to the North [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=342.56s)]
*  and ceasefire talks are at an impasse, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=345.68s)]
*  what happens to the 100 hostages still left in Gaza? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=348.59999999999997s)]
*  Their families are worried that they've been abandoned. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  All right, Robert Berger, with the latest, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=356.47999999999996s)]
*  we appreciate your reporting. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4odTvAqQx0&t=358.12s)]
