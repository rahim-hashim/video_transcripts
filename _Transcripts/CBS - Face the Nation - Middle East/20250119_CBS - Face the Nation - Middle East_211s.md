# Scars on both sides of Middle East conflict as ceasefire takes effect
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc)
*  Good morning. As we come on the air, there is good news to report. We are awaiting official word [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=0.0s)]
*  that the first three hostages have safely crossed the border out of Gaza and are back home in Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=5.84s)]
*  But what you are seeing here now are the crowds awaiting their return. They are, and CBS can confirm, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=11.44s)]
*  in the custody of the Red Cross. We begin today with our Elizabeth Palmer reporting from Jerusalem. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=19.2s)]
*  Liz? The day began with a tense delay as Hamas failed to identify the hostages it was going to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=26.72s)]
*  release and then Israel launched fresh attacks on Gaza. Then suddenly at 11 15 local time, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=34.08s)]
*  the ceasefire fell into place. The first three hostages released by Hamas were handed over to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=40.96s)]
*  the Red Cross in Gaza to begin their journey home. Romy Gonen, who was kidnapped from the Nova Music [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=47.92s)]
*  Festival, Emily Damari and Doron Steinbrecher both seized from their kibbutz, Kfar Aza. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=54.8s)]
*  That was 471 days ago when on October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists abducted or killed more than a [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=63.28s)]
*  thousand people in southern Israel. Within hours, Israel's military was bombing Gaza. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=72.08s)]
*  Fifteen months later, it's too soon to say the war has ended, but it is on pause. Hamas and some [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=79.28s)]
*  of its supporters were celebrating the ceasefire as a victory. As part of the deal, Israel is [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=88.64s)]
*  supposed to release almost a hundred Palestinian prisoners from jail later today. Mohammed al-Halabi [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=95.04s)]
*  is expected to be one of them. His family in Gaza is waiting anxiously. He was arrested when I was [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=101.76s)]
*  only three years old, says his daughter Rihal, and I'm now 12. There are scars on both sides. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=109.12s)]
*  Noah Argamani, a former hostage abducted at the Nova Festival, was rescued after eight terrifying [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=117.2s)]
*  months. I live in a fear every single day. I didn't want the gudlers to suddenly lose control and kill me. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=123.92s)]
*  All the terrorists was armed with many weapons, knife and grenade. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=135.04000000000002s)]
*  I live in a worsen. Every second felt like the last second of my life. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=142.16000000000003s)]
*  So much could go wrong with this complex deal. For a start, it has to hold for months if all [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=149.52s)]
*  the hostages are to be freed. And it depends on two parties with internal rifts. Israel's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  government, whose right wing is fiercely opposed to the ceasefire, and Hamas, which has a weakened [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=162.72s)]
*  and divided leadership. And there's no reason why they should trust each other. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=169.04s)]
*  Gershon Baskin is a former hostage negotiator. So there will be breaches. Definitely. Is there a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=172.56s)]
*  mechanism to deal with the inevitable accusations and breaches and hiccups? This time around there [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=179.04s)]
*  is. It's called Donald Trump. Everyone who wants this deal to hold is pinning hopes on Washington's [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=187.52s)]
*  authority. That includes Gazans who are hungry and desperate for aid to arrive, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  and the hostages' families who want their loved ones back, alive or dead. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMVmxGH_ZGc&t=201.76000000000002s)]
