# Biden says U.S. and allies "defeated" Iran's attack on Israel
**CBS - Face the Nation - Middle East:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY)
*  White House officials say that Iran clearly intended to cause destruction and casualties [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=0.0s)]
*  when it attacked Israel over the weekend. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=5.36s)]
*  The U.S. shot down more than 70 Iranian drones involved in the attack. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=7.92s)]
*  Weijia Jiang joins us now from the White House. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=12.88s)]
*  Weijia, good to see you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=16.28s)]
*  So President Biden spoke at length today about the attack during his meeting that he had [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=17.52s)]
*  today with Iraq's prime minister. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=22.68s)]
*  Let's take a listen to what he had to say. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=24.88s)]
*  Iran launched an unprecedented aerial attack against Israel, and we mounted an unprecedented [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  military effort to defend Israel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=33.08s)]
*  Together with our partners, we defeated that attack. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  So Weijia, from what you've gathered reporting at the White House today, how extensive was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=40.48s)]
*  the U.S.'s involvement here in defending Israel against these attacks? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=45.0s)]
*  Caitlin, the U.S. was incredibly involved in the deterrence ever here, shooting down [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  not only the 70 drones that you mentioned, but a total of 300 drones and missiles, which [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=55.96s)]
*  is exactly why the administration is saying this was a complete and utter failure on Iran's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=62.28s)]
*  part. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=67.92s)]
*  And to your point earlier, they said that because there were so many attempts here with [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=69.36s)]
*  drones and various kinds of missiles being sent over to Israel, that's why they say [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=75.04s)]
*  it is so undeniable that Iran meant to do damage, and the White House categorically [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=80.67999999999999s)]
*  denied any claims or theories that Iran didn't actually meant to do any damage here or harm, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  that they were just trying to perhaps send a domestic message that they would not allow [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  the attack on its consulate in Damascus, Syria, go unanswered. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=100.56s)]
*  And so, this was a huge effort from the U.S. and Israel and other allies in preparation [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=107.0s)]
*  for ultimately what was not a very impactful assault by Iran. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=114.0s)]
*  And what has the White House been telling you about what the U.S.'s response to the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=118.83999999999999s)]
*  attack signals to Iran? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, I asked John Kirby today in the White House briefing about, you know, that very [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  question, and he focused a lot about what we just talked about, which is what the U.S. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  did as the attack was happening. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=139.6s)]
*  President Biden issued a warning to Iran, don't, and now the U.S. is not taking any [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=140.6s)]
*  part in an Israeli reprisal. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=147.6s)]
*  So does that signal to Iran that it can defy the U.S. without facing any consequences? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=149.92s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=155.88s)]
*  If I'm sitting in Tehran and I'm taking a look at what just happened on Saturday night, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=157.12s)]
*  I don't think I'd be betting that the United States is not willing to get engaged here [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  and help defend Israel. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=165.84s)]
*  I mean, you had American fighter pilots in the air in combat operations, shooting down [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=166.84s)]
*  drones and missiles that were heading towards Israel. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=172.16s)]
*  And so I ask that because the U.S., CBS has learned, has made clear to Israel that if [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  there is a reprisal or retaliation for this Iranian strike, the U.S. will not be involved. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  And so you heard what Kirby had to say about why not. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=188.32s)]
*  And I did follow up and say, yes, I hear everything that you're saying about deterrence as the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  attack was happening. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=196.76s)]
*  But what I'm asking about is consequences after the fact, especially since President [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=197.84s)]
*  Biden warned Iran, don't, don't do this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=203.04s)]
*  And Kirby went on to say that the U.S. is working with international allies and partners [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  to determine what is the appropriate consequence for Iran. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=211.48s)]
*  Caitlin? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=215.72s)]
*  And Weijia, on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, you have House Speaker Mike Johnson [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=216.88s)]
*  saying he's going to be pushing for aid to Israel this week. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=221.2s)]
*  What does the White House want Congress to do on this issue? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=225.72s)]
*  Well, the White House wants lawmakers to pass the entire national security supplemental [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=229.72s)]
*  bill, which includes funding not only for Israel, but for Ukraine, for border security, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=236.48s)]
*  for those countries in the Indo-Pacific like Taiwan. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=242.0s)]
*  Today, the White House, during that briefing, the press secretary said the White House does [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  not support a standalone piece of legislation that would only give money to Israel. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=250.52s)]
*  So that was pretty significant, Caitlin, because it looks like that big package that they are [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=257.68s)]
*  hoping to push through somehow isn't going anywhere. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=262.8s)]
*  And so some would argue that it's better to give Israel aid instead of waiting for [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  all those pieces to come together. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=272.32s)]
*  But again, the White House says the president would not support that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=274.48s)]
*  It'll be interesting to see how they piece together a coalition on this. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=277.56s)]
*  Weijia Jiang, thank you very much for your reporting. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=282.16s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=285.64000000000004s)]
*  You too. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO4MCS4r_KY&t=286.64000000000004s)]
